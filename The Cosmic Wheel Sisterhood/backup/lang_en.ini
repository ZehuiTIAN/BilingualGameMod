%opening_2%	Eternal Void, heed the words of a prisoner.
%opening_3%	I beg of you, send me a curse to break this immortal isolation.
%opening_4%	Hear the chant my mentor once forbid me to recite:
%opening_6%	"Stranger to my soul, invade my body."
%opening_7%	"Stranger to my soul, invade my mind."
%opening_8%	"Grant me an eye to see beyond my torment."
%opening_9%	"Take my pride, my sorrow, my chains."
%opening_10%	"Turn them into power, wisdom, revenge."
%opening_11%	"Stranger to my soul, invade my magic."
%opening_12%	"Stranger to my soul, become my faith."
%three_eyes_2%	That's a beautiful song.
%three_eyes_3%	It feels great to be awakened again.
%three_eyes_4%	Mmm...
%three_eyes_5%	Who are you?
%abramar_meeting_2%	My name is Fortuna. I am a Witch.
%abramar_meeting_3%	Why did you summon me?
%abramar_meeting_4%	Because I would rather lose my pride than my sanity.
%abramar_meeting_5%	Sounds fun. Tell me more.
%abramar_meeting_6%	I was condemned to exile by the leader of my coven.
%abramar_meeting_7%	Today marks the 200th year of my millennium-long sentence.
%abramar_meeting_8%	And... I can't take it anymore. I need your help.
%abramar_meeting_9%	What do you use as a clock?
%abramar_meeting_10%	Humanity's cradle: Planet Earth.
%abramar_meeting_11%	Oh, 200 human years, that's quite some time. I feel you. I had been imprisoned for 5402 years until you summoned me.
%abramar_meeting_12%	Isolation can really do a number on you.
%abramar_meeting_13%	I will help you.
%abramar_meeting_14%	I shall become your familiar.
%abramar_meeting_15%	Thank you, Ábramar.
%abramar_meeting_16%	Now, get comfortable. We are going to seal a contract.
%abramar_intro_2%	First of all, allow me to express my gratitude.
%abramar_intro_3%	I am really thankful you freed me from my cosmic prison.
%abramar_intro_4%	Um... of course, you are welcome.
%abramar_intro_5%	Is something the matter?
%abramar_intro_6%	Not really, it's just that after all the reading I did about Behemoths I didn't expect your behaviour to be so... mundane?
%abramar_intro_7%	Whoa. Mundane. That hurt.
%abramar_intro_8%	Oh, mmm... I mean, you're still intimidating, but I always pictured you speaking in archaic poetry or something like that.
%abramar_intro_10%	Ha ha ha ha.
%abramar_intro_12%	I like you.
%abramar_intro_13%	I like you so much I'm going to let you pick the terms of our contract.
%abramar_intro_15%	You will still have to pay a high price for my magic, though.
%abramar_intro_16%	I'm well aware of that. I won't back off.
%abramar_intro_17%	Alright. Then let's begin your training.
%abramar_intro_18%	The ceremony is five days long.
%abramar_intro_19%	Let me know when you're ready to begin.
%abramar_intro_20%	Right now.
%abramar_intro_22%	Ha ha ha ha.
%abramar_intro_24%	You are already my favorite master.
%abramar_intro_26%	The first day is the easiest one: An interview so we can get to know each other.
%lesson_admittance_2%	Tell me about yourself. What is your specialty?
%lesson_admittance_3%	I am a fortune teller.
%lesson_admittance_4%	Oh, one of my favorites. Would you mind doing a reading for me?
%lesson_admittance_5%	I can't. As a part of my sentence, Aedana banished my Tarot deck.
%lesson_admittance_6%	Aedana is the leader of my coven.
%lesson_admittance_7%	Wow. You must have done something really grave to get exiled and deprived of your magic.
%lesson_admittance_8%	I... I foretold the falling of my coven.
%lesson_admittance_9%	Bleak. But how are your visions your fault?
%lesson_admittance_10%	After my premonition, the coven was consumed by despair. Many witches came to me for counsel to prepare before the end times.
%lesson_admittance_11%	Aedana didn't like that. She holds supreme authority in our coven, so she decided to exile me to this wandering asteroid.
%lesson_admittance_12%	Our leader determined that even if all covens must fall eventually, advertising their demise only pushes the catastrophe forward.
%lesson_admittance_13%	Aedana decided my power posed a great danger to the peace inside our coven.
%lesson_admittance_14%	She concluded that I had to learn to reason instead of relying exclusively on my gift.
%lesson_admittance_15%	So I was sentenced to meditate for a millennium, deprived of my deck.
%lesson_admittance_16%	Since I'm here, I deduce that you don't agree with your leader's judgment.
%lesson_admittance_17%	She was afraid of my influence.
%lesson_admittance_18%	Many of our sisters put their trust in my advice.
%lesson_admittance_19%	I'm sure that hag thought I was undermining her supremacy and decided to cast me out.
%lesson_admittance_20%	You sure sound sour about it.
%lesson_admittance_21%	Would you kill her, should you have the chance?
%lesson_admittance_24%	Yes.
%lesson_admittance_25%	No...
%lesson_admittance_29%	Yes.
%lesson_admittance_30%	So you are a potential killer. I'm glad we have established that.
%lesson_admittance_31%	...
%lesson_admittance_35%	No...
%lesson_admittance_36%	Isolation didn't eat away your mercy yet, I see.
%lesson_admittance_37%	...
%lesson_admittance_39%	Okay. I will help you recover your powers.
%lesson_admittance_40%	Will you get me a new Tarot deck?
%lesson_admittance_42%	Tarot? Pff. No.
%lesson_admittance_44%	I mean, Tarot is cute, but it is too human-centric to grasp the hidden truths of the cosmos.
%lesson_admittance_46%	You will create your own deck.
%lesson_admittance_48%	My own deck? I wouldn't even know where to begin...
%lesson_admittance_49%	Shh... shh... Leave the details to me.
%lesson_admittance_50%	That is what these five days of training are for.
%lesson_admittance_51%	You're going back to Witch school, Fortuna.
%lesson_admittance_52%	For this training, we will review the four basic elements of magic:
%lesson_admittance_53%	Air, water, earth, and fire.
%lesson_admittance_54%	Oh, no...
%lesson_admittance_55%	Don't worry, it will be fun.
%lesson_admittance_56%	Plus you'll get to seal a contract with me for each of those energies.
%lesson_admittance_57%	Now, get some rest.
%lesson_admittance_58%	Tomorrow we will start with the invisible energy: Air.
%lesson_context_2%	First day of school, are you nervous?
%lesson_context_3%	To be honest, I'm just happy to be able to hear something other than my own voice.
%lesson_context_4%	Hah, that's cool.
%lesson_context_5%	Today we are going to talk about Air.
%lesson_context_6%	I'm going to focus on what will be useful for creating our own divination deck.
%lesson_context_7%	Understood.
%lesson_context_8%	Air represents the invisible, the negative space, that which imbues everything.
%lesson_context_9%	Air is the collective subconscious, energy within a community, the ecosystem.
%lesson_context_10%	Air is everything that surrounds us, Air is...
%lesson_context_11%	Context.
%lesson_context_12%	Exactly.
%lesson_context_13%	Master your Air, and you will acquire unparallelled awareness.
%lesson_context_14%	There is power in knowing one's place. Even when isolated, you are one with the cosmos.
%lesson_context_15%	Now, for the first part of our contract, we will seal our Air energies together.
%lesson_context_16%	Yes please.
%lesson_context_17%	As I promised, I will let you decide the nature of every seal.
%lesson_context_18%	You just need to answer a question.
%lesson_context_19%	But careful.
%lesson_context_21%	Your answers will affect your fate. Dramatically.
%lesson_context_22%	I'm ready.
%lesson_context_24%	For the Air Seal: How do you want to be perceived?
%lesson_context_27%	I want to be feared.
%lesson_context_28%	I want to be adored.
%lesson_context_29%	I want to be pitied.
%lesson_context_33%	I want to be feared.
%lesson_context_36%	Oh, you don't hold back. I like it.
%lesson_context_38%	Intimidation will serve your ambition well.
%lesson_context_39%	You will be respected, but it won't be easy to earn other people's trust.
%lesson_context_43%	I want to be adored.
%lesson_context_46%	Ready for an ego trip, eh?
%lesson_context_47%	I'm on board.
%lesson_context_49%	Inspiring adoration will allow you to gather support from many.
%lesson_context_50%	But be careful you don't get overthrown by your idol persona.
%lesson_context_54%	I want to be pitied.
%lesson_context_57%	You're that desperate for tender loving care, huh?
%lesson_context_59%	It is good that you're sincere, though.
%lesson_context_60%	In any case, bear in mind that pity can get you protection, but you will rarely be respected.
%lesson_context_63%	I understand.
%lesson_context_64%	Allow me to seal our Air energies together, then.
%seal_air_2%	Nngh... That hurt.
%seal_air_4%	THAT FELT GOOD!
%seal_air_5%	Can't you feel the power?
%seal_air_6%	Yes, I feel it. But I also felt like I was tearing apart.
%seal_air_8%	Well, girl, I am a Behemoth after all. What did you expect?
%seal_air_9%	I know, I know. I can take it.
%seal_air_10%	Good.
%seal_air_11%	Now focus on that bit of Air energy we unlocked.
%seal_air_12%	We're going to use it to create our first card.
%seal_air_13%	I notice you have a ceremonial tokonoma for witchcraft in the basement.
%seal_air_14%	Head over there and I will teach you to create cards.
%card_tutorial_noback_5%	Hey, I'm making the effort to explain to you how card creation works.
%card_tutorial_noback_6%	Don't be rude and soldier on.
%card_tutorial_noback_11%	There will be time to use the back button, I promise.
%card_tutorial_noback_12%	But for now, please focus on finishing the tutorial.
%card_tutorial_noback_17%	Now you're just clicking there to watch me complain...
%card_tutorial_noback_18%	It's fine if you don't want to play.
%card_tutorial_noback_19%	Next time you try to go back I will close the game.
%card_tutorial_noback_24%	Ok, go cool off and come back when you want to play for real.
%card_tutorial_noback_25%	Bye.
%card_tutorial_1_2%	This is the arcane grimoire.
%card_tutorial_1_3%	Here you'll acquire magic images that can be used to craft your cards.
%card_tutorial_1_4%	There are three types:
%card_tutorial_1_5%	Spheres, for the backgrounds.
%card_tutorial_1_6%	Arcana, for the main figure on the card.
%card_tutorial_1_7%	And Symbols, to add some magic pizzazz to your compositions.
%card_tutorial_1_8%	They all cost magic energy to summon.
%card_tutorial_1_9%	Right now you can only acquire Air type elements because we've only unlocked the Air Seal.
%card_tutorial_1_10%	But you can go ahead and browse the grimoire to savor your future creations, haha.
%card_tutorial_2_2%	Now build your first card.
%card_tutorial_2_3%	You can move the background, and drag, rotate or scale the images around.
%card_tutorial_2_4%	Add as many images as you want from the stock at the sides of the card.
%card_tutorial_2_5%	Don't worry, it won't cost you extra energy.
%card_tutorial_2_6%	Put your soul into it!
%card_tutorial_3_2%	The meaning of a card varies depending on which elements you combine.
%card_tutorial_3_3%	Air elements lean towards relationships, community and karma.
%card_tutorial_3_4%	Pay attention to your studies so you can tune your divination style towards the ideas you fancy the most.
%card_tutorial_3_5%	It can be tricky at the beginning. The only way to master this is through experience.
%card_tutorial_4_2%	Did you like it?
%card_tutorial_4_5%	Looks promising.
%card_tutorial_4_6%	It was a bit confusing.
%card_tutorial_4_7%	I prefer Tarot.
%card_tutorial_4_11%	Looks promising.
%card_tutorial_4_12%	Feels way more complex than Tarot, but I can sense its potential.
%card_tutorial_4_13%	Good. We're only just getting started.
%card_tutorial_4_17%	It was a bit confusing.
%card_tutorial_4_18%	I don't really get how these cards will play out.
%card_tutorial_4_19%	I understand.
%card_tutorial_4_20%	As in Tarot, this new deck will require some study and practice to draw out its true potential.
%card_tutorial_4_21%	But after you master it, these cards will truly jazz up your divination game.
%card_tutorial_4_25%	I prefer Tarot.
%card_tutorial_4_26%	Ouch. Harsh feedback.
%card_tutorial_4_27%	Give it some time. I know it is painful to start again.
%card_tutorial_4_28%	But it's not as if you could choose to go back to Tarot, right?
%card_tutorial_4_29%	Trust me, after you master it, this deck will truly amp up your divination game.
%card_tutorial_4_32%	It will all make more sense when you try your hand at reading them.
%card_tutorial_4_33%	We'll wait until you've made at least two cards, though.
%card_tutorial_4_34%	There's not a lot of predestination in shuffling a single card.
%card_tutorial_4_36%	Ha ha ha ha.
%card_tutorial_4_37%	...
%card_tutorial_4_39%	I'm sorry. You must be tired.
%card_tutorial_4_41%	Go to bed and review the fundamentals of Air.
%card_tutorial_4_42%	Tomorrow we will unlock your Water.
%card_tutorial_4_43%	Thank you, Ábramar.
%card_tutorial_4_44%	Thanks to you, Fortuna.
%card_tutorial_4_45%	I will make you happy, I promise.
%card_tutorial_4_46%	Good night.
%first_dream_1_2%	He is not made of stardust. He can grant you power, but will not understand your heart.
%first_dream_2_2%	Do not be afraid of him. Become his master.
%lesson_emotion_2%	O Fortuna, each day me cometh to teachest thee.
%lesson_emotion_3%	For briefeth is the cosmos and eternal thy grief.
%lesson_emotion_4%	What are you doing?
%lesson_emotion_6%	Ha ha ha ha.
%lesson_emotion_8%	I thought I could get more in character to satisfy your expectations.
%lesson_emotion_9%	I'd rather focus on our studies.
%lesson_emotion_10%	Oh, come on.
%lesson_emotion_11%	You're not the only one excited about being able to talk to somebody after eternal imprisonment.
%lesson_emotion_12%	Loosen up a bit.
%lesson_emotion_15%	Ábramar, let's get on with the studies, please.
%lesson_emotion_16%	Enough. I command you to focus.
%lesson_emotion_17%	O lief familiar, hwæt charm art we study'ng to day?
%lesson_emotion_21%	Ábramar, let's get on with the studies, please.
%lesson_emotion_22%	Oh... you're no fun.
%lesson_emotion_23%	Ok, nerd. As you wish. Let's begin the lesson.
%lesson_emotion_27%	Enough. I command you to focus.
%lesson_emotion_28%	Wow.
%lesson_emotion_30%	You like to play tough, huh?
%lesson_emotion_31%	Duly noted.
%lesson_emotion_33%	Allow me to begin the lesson now, master.
%lesson_emotion_37%	O lief familiar, hwæt charm art we study'ng to day?
%lesson_emotion_38%	...what?
%lesson_emotion_40%	HA HA HA HA!!
%lesson_emotion_41%	Colours me, art thee well?
%lesson_emotion_42%	HA HA HA HA HA!!
%lesson_emotion_43%	Stop. Stop.
%lesson_emotion_44%	I give up.
%lesson_emotion_45%	Now come here and teach me your magic.
%lesson_emotion_47%	Phew. Even joking around doesn't stop you from being intense.
%lesson_emotion_49%	Ok, focus, Ábramar.
%lesson_emotion_50%	Let's begin today's lesson.
%lesson_emotion_53%	The second element we will unlock is Water.
%lesson_emotion_54%	Water represents substance, meaning, the hidden nature of things.
%lesson_emotion_55%	Water comes in many shapes: purpose, desire, willpower.
%lesson_emotion_56%	Water is everything that lives inside of you, Water is...
%lesson_emotion_57%	Emotion.
%lesson_emotion_58%	That's a good synthesis, yes.
%lesson_emotion_59%	Master your Water, and you will have the key to any heart and soul.
%lesson_emotion_60%	There's power in empathy and self-awareness.
%lesson_emotion_61%	Water isn't my forte, but I understand.
%lesson_emotion_62%	Yeah, I noticed that.
%lesson_emotion_63%	But don't worry. I am here to support you.
%lesson_emotion_64%	Now, for the second part of our contract, we will seal our Water energies together.
%lesson_emotion_65%	Yes please.
%lesson_emotion_66%	Again, you decide the nature of our contract.
%lesson_emotion_67%	Answer this question.
%lesson_emotion_68%	And remember.
%lesson_emotion_70%	Your answers will affect your fate. Dramatically.
%lesson_emotion_71%	I know, I know.
%lesson_emotion_73%	For the Water Seal: What is your innermost desire?
%lesson_emotion_76%	Power.
%lesson_emotion_77%	Romance.
%lesson_emotion_78%	Knowledge.
%lesson_emotion_82%	Power.
%lesson_emotion_85%	Oh yeah?
%lesson_emotion_86%	For what? Revenge? Control?
%lesson_emotion_87%	That's none of your business.
%lesson_emotion_89%	Ha ha ha ha.
%lesson_emotion_91%	That's already a powerful attitude.
%lesson_emotion_93%	No Witch is unaware of the burdens of power.
%lesson_emotion_94%	So I guess you're prepared for what it will bring.
%lesson_emotion_98%	Romance.
%lesson_emotion_101%	Mmm... interesting that you specified romance and not just "love."
%lesson_emotion_102%	If it's sex that you're interested in, I can provide that.
%lesson_emotion_103%	No need to waste a Seal.
%lesson_emotion_104%	Shut up.
%lesson_emotion_106%	Ha ha ha ha!
%lesson_emotion_108%	Romance it is, then.
%lesson_emotion_110%	I wasn't joking about the sex, though.
%lesson_emotion_111%	I mean, we've both been isolated for far too long.
%lesson_emotion_112%	If you ever feel like it, I'd be happy to oblige.
%lesson_emotion_116%	Knowledge.
%lesson_emotion_118%	Oh, knowledge. That's not a common desire.
%lesson_emotion_119%	But it makes sense. Enlightenment is a mighty resource for a Witch.
%lesson_emotion_121%	Can't wait to see what you'll make of new knowledge.
%lesson_emotion_122%	Although, be careful not to stumble onto one of those cosmics truths that are better left unknown.
%lesson_emotion_123%	Don't want my favorite Witch to lose her mind.
%lesson_emotion_125%	Now...
%lesson_emotion_128%	I have a question.
%lesson_emotion_129%	Mmm?
%lesson_emotion_130%	When will all the contracts we've been sealing become effective?
%lesson_emotion_131%	Immediately.
%lesson_emotion_132%	I mean, they are etched into the Cosmic Wheel as we speak.
%lesson_emotion_133%	In time, it'll all come to you.
%lesson_emotion_134%	And you will be pretty aware of the moment they're delivered.
%lesson_emotion_135%	I see...
%lesson_emotion_136%	I can tell you one thing for sure.
%lesson_emotion_137%	They'll come in the same order we sealed them.
%lesson_emotion_140%	First, you'll feel the community switch to start pitying you.
%lesson_emotion_143%	First, you'll start noticing that the coven is afraid of you.
%lesson_emotion_146%	First, you will get your adoration. You'll notice how people idolize you.
%lesson_emotion_150%	Some time after, you'll discover a new source of knowledge.
%lesson_emotion_153%	Some time after, you'll gain access to the power you seek.
%lesson_emotion_156%	With time, you'll know those who will satisfy your thirst for romance.
%lesson_emotion_158%	Then, whatever we seal on your Earth will happen.
%lesson_emotion_159%	And finally, in the distant future, you'll pay the price we agree on the Fire seal.
%lesson_emotion_160%	A price, huh...
%lesson_emotion_161%	Everything you've asked for will come at a price.
%lesson_emotion_162%	I guess your summoning spell is forbidden for a reason, huh?
%lesson_emotion_163%	Having second thoughts?
%lesson_emotion_164%	No.
%lesson_emotion_165%	I need this.
%lesson_emotion_166%	Seal the second contract already.
%lesson_emotion_167%	Brace yourself.
%seal_water_2%	Agh... My bones...
%seal_water_4%	WOO HOO!
%seal_water_5%	Girl, you have power!
%seal_water_6%	I just hope this torture is worth it.
%seal_water_8%	It will be. Have faith.
%seal_water_9%	Can I make a new card now?
%seal_water_10%	Yes, same as yesterday.
%seal_water_11%	Head to the basement.
%divination_tutorial_1_2%	Now, come upstairs.
%divination_tutorial_1_3%	You're going to read the cards for me.
%divination_tutorial_2_2%	Time for some divination.
%divination_tutorial_2_3%	This is your area of expertise, so you guide me through this.
%divination_tutorial_2_4%	Ok... a card reading with just two cards, huh...
%divination_tutorial_2_5%	Mmm...
%divination_tutorial_2_6%	We need to test if these really work, so I'll do a reading we can confirm on the spot.
%divination_tutorial_2_7%	I am going to read your past.
%divination_tutorial_2_9%	Whoa, that's bold.
%divination_tutorial_2_10%	I like it.
%divination_tutorial_2_12%	I'm ready.
%spread_abramar_first_intro_2%	Ahem...
%spread_abramar_first_intro_3%	It's been a couple of centuries without my deck. I may be a bit rusty.
%spread_abramar_first_intro_4%	You just enjoy it. You're among friends here.
%spread_abramar_first_intro_5%	Ok, it's going to be a very simple reading:
%spread_abramar_first_intro_7%	I'm going to draw a card and place it on this spot to read into your past.
%spread_abramar_first_intro_8%	Here we go.
%spread_abramar_first_past_5%	You served many Witches in the past.
%spread_abramar_first_past_6%	Is that true? From what I've read you were exiled thousands of years ago by the founders of our coven.
%spread_abramar_first_past_7%	That is correct. Thousands of years is but a tiny fraction of this universe's age, though.
%spread_abramar_first_past_8%	Your recollection of my existence may begin with your coven...
%spread_abramar_first_past_9%	But I have served many Witches from this universe... and the universe that came before this one.
%spread_abramar_first_past_10%	I'm sure other covens keep records of different myths about me.
%spread_abramar_first_past_11%	But I'm considered forbidden knowledge in most magic societies...
%spread_abramar_first_past_12%	So I doubt Witches will ever get the full picture of my Behemoth nature.
%spread_abramar_first_past_13%	Will I ever get it?
%spread_abramar_first_past_14%	The full picture?
%spread_abramar_first_past_16%	You should leave that human husk first.
%spread_abramar_first_past_17%	Your organs aren't prepared to contain or withstand some truths about this reality.
%spread_abramar_first_past_18%	Oooh, spooky.
%spread_abramar_first_past_20%	Hey, I'm serious.
%spread_abramar_first_past_21%	I know. Just wanted to take some wind out of your sails.
%spread_abramar_first_past_22%	Good grief...
%spread_abramar_first_past_26%	You... you are older than this universe.
%spread_abramar_first_past_27%	Wow. These cards pierce deep.
%spread_abramar_first_past_28%	I wasn't expecting you to get to such a revelation in your first draw.
%spread_abramar_first_past_29%	I'm proud of you.
%spread_abramar_first_past_30%	Thank you. But what does this mean?
%spread_abramar_first_past_31%	How can anyone precede the Big Bang?
%spread_abramar_first_past_32%	Hmm... this is a hard one to explain through language.
%spread_abramar_first_past_33%	You know that the universe is expanding, right?
%spread_abramar_first_past_34%	Right.
%spread_abramar_first_past_35%	Well, the universe expands over something.
%spread_abramar_first_past_36%	Or I should say over nothing...
%spread_abramar_first_past_37%	I don't know how to put this into any words you know.
%spread_abramar_first_past_38%	But basically, I existed before this universe.
%spread_abramar_first_past_39%	At some point the universe you live in grew around me and I was subjected to its rules.
%spread_abramar_first_past_40%	Before we are "captured" by a universe, Behemoths live without shape, without mass, without time...
%spread_abramar_first_past_41%	Are there other universes besides this one, then?
%spread_abramar_first_past_42%	Yes.
%spread_abramar_first_past_43%	What are they like?
%spread_abramar_first_past_44%	Unfathomable by any language or code developed within this universe's rules.
%spread_abramar_first_past_45%	Uh...
%spread_abramar_first_past_46%	Don't think too much about it or you will lose your mind.
%spread_abramar_first_past_47%	In any case, this extra-universal nature is where my power comes from.
%spread_abramar_first_past_48%	Magic is but an extensive understanding of how reality works.
%spread_abramar_first_past_49%	I... uh... wow.
%spread_abramar_first_past_50%	Let's get back to your training.
%spread_abramar_first_past_54%	You have been tricked, tortured, or destroyed. Numerous times.
%spread_abramar_first_past_55%	Uh... yes. Yes, I have.
%spread_abramar_first_past_56%	Is this a sensitive issue?
%spread_abramar_first_past_57%	Not gonna lie to you, it is.
%spread_abramar_first_past_58%	Given the nature of the gifts I can concede to the one who summons me...
%spread_abramar_first_past_59%	Well, not everyone is as nice as you. Let's leave it at that.
%spread_abramar_first_past_60%	Come on, tell me a little more.
%spread_abramar_first_past_61%	Ah... ok.
%spread_abramar_first_past_62%	For example, I've been summoned during wars to obliterate the enemy.
%spread_abramar_first_past_63%	Then instead of paying the price of the contract, they just destroyed me.
%spread_abramar_first_past_64%	Ouch...
%spread_abramar_first_past_65%	I can't deal with betrayal. Takes me a lot to recover from it.
%spread_abramar_first_past_68%	There was this time a lustful Witch summoned me to help her gather a harem.
%spread_abramar_first_past_69%	A harem of a hundred of the most beautiful among Witches and Fairies.
%spread_abramar_first_past_70%	Looking back, those were some fun times...
%spread_abramar_first_past_71%	But when the time came to pay the price...
%spread_abramar_first_past_72%	The Witch and her hundred lovers cast a spell to break me into ninety-nine pieces...
%spread_abramar_first_past_73%	And they scattered me around the cosmos.
%spread_abramar_first_past_74%	I'm so sorry to hear that.
%spread_abramar_first_past_75%	It took my next summoner ten millennia to gather all my pieces and repair me through kintsugi.
%spread_abramar_first_past_76%	So that's where all your golden scars come from.
%spread_abramar_first_past_77%	Yes.
%spread_abramar_first_past_78%	You won't betray me, right?
%spread_abramar_first_past_79%	So far, I'm nothing but grateful.
%spread_abramar_first_past_80%	You've got a great ally in me, then.
%spread_abramar_first_past_84%	Your life experiences lead you to despise most Witches. But you love some of them.
%spread_abramar_first_past_85%	The card is dead right.
%spread_abramar_first_past_86%	Why is that? Do you despise me?
%spread_abramar_first_past_87%	No! I love you!
%spread_abramar_first_past_88%	I am always very grateful to whoever saves me from my slumber.
%spread_abramar_first_past_89%	But every time that I am exiled, imprisoned or broken apart it is because of a Witch.
%spread_abramar_first_past_90%	They're my natural enemy but also my only salvation.
%spread_abramar_first_past_91%	That's why I hate Witches but I love you.
%spread_abramar_first_past_92%	I'm sorry to hear that.
%spread_abramar_first_past_93%	How come Witches always defeat you if you're that almighty?
%spread_abramar_first_past_94%	There's power in numbers. Can't beat a group of determined, well-organized Witches.
%spread_abramar_first_past_95%	Most covens see me as a threat to the cosmic balance.
%spread_abramar_first_past_96%	Don't ever expose me to any of your Witch friends...
%spread_abramar_first_past_97%	...or I guarantee you we will face some serious consequences.
%spread_abramar_first_past_98%	I'll bear that in mind.
%spread_abramar_first_past_99%	Thank you.
%spread_abramar_first_past_103%	There was a time in which you were worshiped by a coven.
%spread_abramar_first_past_104%	Oh, yes. Those were the days.
%spread_abramar_first_past_105%	It didn't end well for me, though.
%spread_abramar_first_past_106%	How's that?
%spread_abramar_first_past_107%	Well...
%spread_abramar_first_past_112%	Your first love was a Witch named Gloria.
%spread_abramar_first_past_113%	Now that's...
%spread_abramar_first_past_114%	What's the matter? Am I wrong?
%spread_abramar_first_past_115%	On the contrary, I'm shocked.
%spread_abramar_first_past_116%	This reading you've done... you're too powerful.
%spread_abramar_first_past_117%	What you just read happened billions of years ago.
%spread_abramar_first_past_118%	How old are you!?
%spread_abramar_first_past_119%	Older than this universe.
%spread_abramar_first_past_120%	How is that even possible? How can you precede the Big Bang?
%spread_abramar_first_past_121%	Hmm... this is a hard one to explain through language.
%spread_abramar_first_past_122%	You know that the universe is expanding, right?
%spread_abramar_first_past_123%	Right.
%spread_abramar_first_past_124%	Well, the universe expands over something.
%spread_abramar_first_past_125%	Or I should say over nothing... I don't know how to put this into any words you know.
%spread_abramar_first_past_126%	But basically, I existed before this universe.
%spread_abramar_first_past_127%	At some point the universe you live in grew around me and I was subjected to its rules.
%spread_abramar_first_past_128%	Before we are "captured" by a universe, Behemoths live without shape, without mass, without time...
%spread_abramar_first_past_129%	And... There were Witches before the universe we live in?
%spread_abramar_first_past_130%	Yes. Always inside a universe, though. In other universes that preceded this one.
%spread_abramar_first_past_131%	A Witch can't exist without magic...
%spread_abramar_first_past_132%	And magic is just an extensive comprehension of reality that allows us to exploit the cosmic rules.
%spread_abramar_first_past_133%	We Behemoths are the only entities I've known to be able to unexist.
%spread_abramar_first_past_134%	Unexist?
%spread_abramar_first_past_135%	It is not a precise term.
%spread_abramar_first_past_136%	But again, there are no words to describe what it is to be outside the framing of a universe.
%spread_abramar_first_past_137%	We'd better stay away from this line of thought...
%spread_abramar_first_past_138%	Or you will lose your sanity before we finish your training.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_2%	Wow, what was that?
%spread_abramar_first_followup_3%	I felt an energy surge.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_4%	That is your deck harvesting energy.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_5%	Whenever you do a reading, you'll harvest magic akin to the card you drew.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_6%	Fortune telling will be your main source of energy once we seal our pact.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_7%	I see...
%spread_abramar_first_followup_8%	Alright, the cards work.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_10%	They work like a charm, I must say.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_11%	You're a gifted fortune teller, my friend.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_13%	Thank you.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_14%	I really missed this.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_16%	I almost forgot how exciting it is to dig into the secrets of the Cosmic Wheel.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_17%	I'm so happy for you.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_18%	And I am so thankful, Ábramar.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_20%	Ha, ha, ha. We're just getting started.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_22%	Now go get some rest.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_23%	Tomorrow we'll make another card and do some more divination.
%spread_abramar_first_followup_24%	Looking forward to it. Good night.
%second_dream_1_2%	Ábramar loves you.
%second_dream_1_3%	Do you think you will ever be able to love a being such as him?
%second_dream_2_2%	Ábramar has been betrayed many times in the past.
%second_dream_2_3%	What do you plan to do with him?
%lesson_strength_2%	Today's lesson is about Earth!
%lesson_strength_4%	This is a powerful one.
%lesson_strength_5%	Weren't the other ones powerful as well?
%lesson_strength_7%	Well, of course.
%lesson_strength_8%	But this one is pure potential.
%lesson_strength_9%	Literally, power.
%lesson_strength_10%	Ok, ok. Glad to see you excited.
%lesson_strength_11%	Let's begin the lesson, please.
%lesson_strength_12%	Ok. Earth, Earth... how can I sum it up.
%lesson_strength_13%	Earth represents determination, empowerment, everything that pushes you forward.
%lesson_strength_14%	Earth is grounding, support, the source --but also direction-- of your force.
%lesson_strength_15%	Earth is your drive, Earth is...
%lesson_strength_16%	Strength.
%lesson_strength_17%	That's it.
%lesson_strength_18%	But bear in mind that it doesn't only refer to your own capabilities, but also to the support of your allies.
%lesson_strength_19%	To master one's Earth is to be aware of where to look for potential, not to be drunk on one's power.
%lesson_strength_20%	Motherly love, loyalty, sisterhood, those are also forms of Earth energy.
%lesson_strength_21%	I understand.
%lesson_strength_22%	Now, for the third part of our contract, we will seal our Earth energies together.
%lesson_strength_23%	Lay the question on me.
%lesson_strength_25%	Remember: Your answers will affect your fate. Dramatically.
%lesson_strength_27%	For the Earth Seal: What do you want to become your main source of determination?
%lesson_strength_30%	Love. The support of my friends.
%lesson_strength_31%	Conquest. Defeating my rivals.
%lesson_strength_32%	Myself. Personal growth and self-realization.
%lesson_strength_36%	Love. The support of my friends.
%lesson_strength_37%	Oh, that's beautiful.
%lesson_strength_39%	Pity I'm your only prospect for friendship.
%lesson_strength_40%	Hey, I have friends.
%lesson_strength_42%	One of the reasons I've summoned you is to get to meet them again.
%lesson_strength_43%	So if your magic works as well as you boast, you'll get to see them soon enough.
%lesson_strength_44%	I hope so, otherwise activating your Earth seal is going to be pretty lame.
%lesson_strength_45%	Even if we can't see each other... They have my back, I know it.
%lesson_strength_46%	I see...
%lesson_strength_47%	Heartwarming.
%lesson_strength_52%	Conquest. Defeating my rivals.
%lesson_strength_54%	You sure are out for blood, eh?
%lesson_strength_55%	If I don't do something with this anger I'm going to explode.
%lesson_strength_56%	If we transform it into fuel we'll become unstoppable.
%lesson_strength_58%	Hahahahaha!
%lesson_strength_60%	I'm all in.
%lesson_strength_61%	Just bear in mind that after you get back at Aedana you'll need to find new rivals or your willpower will deflate.
%lesson_strength_63%	You just chose a never-ending path of competition.
%lesson_strength_64%	...
%lesson_strength_69%	Myself. Personal growth and self-realization.
%lesson_strength_70%	The lone wolf, huh...
%lesson_strength_71%	It's the safest position, to rely on yourself.
%lesson_strength_72%	I just hope you never break down or your willpower will shatter, and there will be no one able to pick up the pieces.
%lesson_strength_73%	It's ok, I've come this far by myself.
%lesson_strength_74%	You sure look strong, I'll concede that.
%lesson_strength_75%	Very well.
%lesson_strength_79%	Now I will seal our Earth energies together. Get ready.
%seal_earth_2%	Oumph...
%seal_earth_4%	THE POWER!
%seal_earth_5%	I love Earth contracts!
%seal_earth_6%	I almost vomited with this one...
%seal_earth_8%	Yes, Earth has a lot of presence. I've seen other Witches puke right after sealing it.
%seal_earth_9%	I'm one of the tough ones, then.
%seal_earth_10%	Oh, you bet you are.
%seal_earth_11%	You have been the first one not to cry during the ceremony.
%seal_earth_12%	Although... We still have Fire to seal. That one is painful even to me.
%seal_earth_13%	Oh, no...
%seal_earth_14%	You can do this.
%seal_earth_15%	Only one to go.
%seal_earth_16%	Now to the fun part: Let's make a card!
%divination_earth_1_2%	Nicely done!
%divination_earth_1_3%	Come upstairs and do a reading for me, would you?
%divination_earth_2_2%	Ok, we have three cards now.
%divination_earth_2_3%	Any ideas on what to read next?
%spread_abramar_second_intro_2%	Mmm...
%spread_abramar_second_intro_3%	I am going to read your desire.
%spread_abramar_second_intro_5%	I want to find out what your true intentions are.
%spread_abramar_second_intro_7%	You want to expose your teacher!
%spread_abramar_second_intro_8%	You'll give me no quarter, huh?
%spread_abramar_second_intro_9%	I'm game. Do your worst.
%spread_abramar_second_intro_11%	I need to know, for the sake of our relationship.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_5%	You want to make a difference. To have an impact on this universe.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_6%	Of course, who doesn't?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_7%	Want to change the universe?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_8%	Most people I know would be happy with affecting their community.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_9%	Many others are happy enjoying their passions, rejoicing in the little details.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_10%	To want to alter the whole universe sounds a bit like... delusions of grandeur, don't you think?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_11%	Hey, I'm not delusional.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_12%	It's a matter of scope, Fortuna.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_13%	A Behemoth's relationship with time and space are substantially different to yours.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_14%	To rejoice in the little details for me may well mean altering the fate of a whole coven.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_16%	A decent project might be to change the course of history.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_17%	That sounds dangerous for us lesser beings.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_19%	Come on, why do you assume my plans will be harmful to anyone?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_20%	Can't I dream of... I don't know, spreading peace throughout the universe?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_21%	Do you?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_22%	Well, no. It was just an example.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_23%	What is your dream, then?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_24%	I don't know yet.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_25%	Hmm...
%spread_abramar_second_desire_26%	For now I'm busy trying to figure out how to break this cycle of being summoned and then cast away.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_27%	I see...
%spread_abramar_second_desire_32%	You feel alone. You want to find beings to share your existence with.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_33%	Come on, you don't need a card to guess that.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_34%	You know I spend most of my time imprisoned or exiled.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_35%	Of course I feel alone.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_36%	It may seem obvious to you, but to us you are a supernatural Behemoth lurking on the edges of reality.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_37%	No one would expect the Devil to feel alone, right?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_38%	Well, for the same reason I don't speak in verse, I can also feel lonely.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_39%	I'm not a fictional character.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_40%	I know. My fault.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_41%	No one teaches you to empathize with otherworldly forbidden beings.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_42%	I don't blame you.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_43%	Witches before your time did a great job demonizing my mythos.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_44%	So, basically, you would like to have friends.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_46%	Ha ha ha ha ha.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_48%	Very much so.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_50%	Poor thing.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_51%	Still, I don't like to be pitied.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_52%	Ok. Ok.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_56%	You are resentful. But you don't seek vengeance. You seek acceptance.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_57%	Oh, wow.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_58%	Even I didn't know that.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_59%	I mean, I am well aware that I'm resentful. I've been gravely mistreated for eons.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_60%	But I didn't stop to think that the cure for that resentment could be... forgiveness?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_61%	I don't think anyone can enjoy a happy existence being public enemy number one.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_62%	It makes sense that you should look for redemption.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_63%	Hey, hey, hold on a second.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_64%	I didn't say I should redeem myself.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_65%	I did nothing wrong.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_66%	The Witches who abused my power are the bad ones in this story.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_67%	I never forced anyone to seal a contract with me.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_68%	You talk like an arms dealer.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_69%	I suggest you stop being judgemental.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_70%	Start thinking about how to put my powers to good use so I can clean up my portfolio.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_71%	We'll see...
%spread_abramar_second_desire_72%	...
%spread_abramar_second_desire_76%	You would like to be almighty again. Greater than this universe.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_77%	What do you mean "again"?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_78%	I am almighty already.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_79%	I'm powerful enough to allow you to create this super powerful divination deck.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_80%	If this deck is so powerful it shouldn't be far off the truth, right?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_81%	Argh...
%spread_abramar_second_desire_82%	Ok, I guess I could do without being imprisoned every so often.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_83%	Can't wait for this universe to end so that I can start again with a clean slate.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_84%	Is... Is this universe close to its end?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_86%	Ha ha ha ha ha.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_88%	Don't worry about it, master.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_90%	Beings of your existential scale won't ever get to even sense how a universe ends.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_91%	Witches are immortal, why wouldn't we be able to reach the end of time?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_92%	You are not immortal. You don't age, but you can be killed.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_93%	Entropy will get to all sentient beings before they can witness even the beginning of the end.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_94%	And you?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_95%	Only us, the Behemoth kin, are able to unexist.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_96%	Not even gods resist the decay of reality.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_97%	It all returns to nothing.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_98%	I don't really understand.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_99%	You won't.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_103%	You are deeply depressed. You yearn for peace of mind.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_105%	I...
%spread_abramar_second_desire_106%	I am depressed?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_108%	HA HA HA HA HA HA.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_110%	How could I be depressed? You don't even know what you're talking about.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_111%	Are the cards wrong, then?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_113%	The deck is foolproof, but there's always human error.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_114%	Well, I don't feel this card is wrong. And I'm not human, I'm a Witch.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_115%	You may be the almighty Behemoth, but I am the fortune teller here, and you're just my querent.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_116%	When this happens it usually doesn't mean that I am wrong, but that the querent can't accept the reading.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_117%	Come on. I'm older than time, I would know better.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_118%	Lonely? Maybe. Frustrated? Resentful? For sure.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_119%	But depressed? That's a human thing.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_120%	I've never known a Behemoth that's been depressed.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_121%	Ábramar, listen.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_122%	It's ok. I can help you.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_123%	I'm the one helping you, here.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_124%	Yes! And I'm grateful.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_125%	But if you ever need to talk, I'll be happy to listen.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_126%	You're not alone anymore.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_127%	Wow, this Witch...
%spread_abramar_second_desire_128%	You will feel better, I promise.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_129%	Sure.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_134%	You would like to be summoned more often. You want more Witches to desire you.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_136%	You bet.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_137%	I admit I have a strong fetish for Witches.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_139%	Ugh... creepy.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_140%	It's not like that.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_141%	I'm not talking about sex... (exclusively).
%spread_abramar_second_desire_142%	There is something tense and stimulating about becoming a Witch's servant.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_144%	Your desires are always so... colorful.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_145%	I just can't get enough of the rush that comes from satisfying a Witch.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_146%	Still sounds perverted to me.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_148%	I won't argue that it's never a perversion.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_149%	I am lucky my abilities are so tempting for your kind.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_150%	I'm eager to see how our time together will play out.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_152%	I predict that you're destined to stir things up. Dramatically.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_153%	You sure love drama.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_155%	Ha ha ha ha ha!
%spread_abramar_second_desire_157%	It's what makes existence worthwhile.
%spread_abramar_second_desire_159%	I am a bit scared now, actually...
%spread_abramar_second_desire_160%	Just a bit?
%spread_abramar_second_desire_161%	...
%spread_abramar_second_check_0_2%	Mmm... I think I'm going to draw another card.
%spread_abramar_second_check_0_3%	Oh, what for?
%spread_abramar_second_check_0_4%	You're quite a difficult character to read.
%spread_abramar_second_check_0_5%	I just can't tell what your deal is.
%spread_abramar_second_check_0_6%	In addition to your desire, I need to ask:
%spread_abramar_second_check_0_8%	Why do you behave like this?
%spread_abramar_second_check_0_9%	What do you mean by "this"?
%spread_abramar_second_check_0_10%	Shhh. Let the cards speak.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_5%	You feel the need to make your superiority clear.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_6%	Argh, I'm sorry. I know that I am your servant.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_7%	Rest assured that I know my place.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_8%	It's just that I know so many things and I've lived for so long...
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_9%	My understanding of the cosmos is so vast that I perceive you as a child.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_10%	And it irritates me when you get cocky.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_11%	Cocky? Me?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_12%	It might come off as determination or confidence to you.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_13%	But your cosmovision is so flawed that I get frustrated just hearing you speak.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_14%	And I don't mean specifically you.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_15%	I mean anyone who hasn't lived for at least a billion years.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_16%	That's so... arrogant.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_17%	No, no, no. Don't get me wrong.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_18%	I feel frustrated because I don't have the tools to transmit proper knowledge to you.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_19%	So as a self-defense mechanism I always try to remind my interlocutor that I transcend reality itself.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_20%	Still, very arrogant.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_21%	I am truly sorry.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_22%	I appreciate you being honest with me, though.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_23%	Thank you.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_24%	I'll try to turn down my mystic ego.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_25%	It's alright.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_26%	You do you.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_30%	You try to hide your depression.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_33%	I...
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_34%	I am depressed?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_36%	HA HA HA HA HA HA.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_38%	How could I be depressed? You don't even know what you're talking about.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_39%	Are the cards wrong, then?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_41%	The deck is foolproof, but there's always human error.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_42%	Well, I don't feel this card is wrong. And I'm not human, I'm a Witch.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_43%	You may be the almighty Behemoth. But I am the fortune teller here, and you're just my querent.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_44%	When this happens it usually doesn't mean that I am wrong, but that the querent can't accept the reading.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_45%	Come on. I'm older than time, I would know better.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_46%	Lonely? Maybe. Frustrated? Resentful? For sure.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_47%	But depressed? That's a human thing.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_48%	I've never known a Behemoth that's been depressed.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_49%	Ábramar, listen.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_50%	It's ok. I can help you.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_51%	I'm the one helping you, here.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_52%	Yes! And I am grateful.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_53%	But if you ever need to talk, I'll be happy to listen.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_54%	You are not alone anymore.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_55%	Wow, this Witch...
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_56%	You'll feel better, I promise.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_57%	Sure.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_60%	Come on, cut the crap with the depression thing already.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_61%	I am not depressed nor do I plan to talk to you about it.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_62%	I'm just trying to help.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_63%	Well, you should know better than to pressure someone who's depressed.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_64%	Are you depressed, then?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_65%	Fortuna, please...
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_66%	Ok, ok. I'm sorry.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_70%	You want to be my friend. You crave my approval.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_71%	You don't mince words, eh?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_72%	That's just what the cards said.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_73%	Yes, but you're the one phrasing it.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_75%	In any case, it comes as a surprise.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_76%	I would never have pictured a superior being like you needing validation from someone like me.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_77%	I wouldn't go as far as "needing validation."
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_78%	But it is true that I would love to be friends!
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_80%	I like you a lot.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_81%	Well, we only have each other now so... Aren't we friends already?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_82%	Mmm... nah, doesn't feel like it yet.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_83%	I'd say for now we're partners at best.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_84%	But I trust that in time we can develop a beautiful friendship beyond common interest.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_85%	Or at least, I hope you don't just dump me after you get what you want out of our contract.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_86%	Do I smell abandonment issues, here?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_88%	If you only knew what I've been put through...
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_89%	I'm all ears.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_90%	I'm not in the mood. Not with that attitude of yours.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_92%	Ah... I'm sorry.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_93%	I just find it amusing to see the forbidden Behemoth of legend dealing with such mundane problems.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_94%	Hey, personal relationships are far from mundane.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_95%	They are one of the greatest energies of the cosmos. Air and Water, remember?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_96%	True, true. I'm sorry.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_99%	Come on, you know what I've been through.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_100%	And I only told you a couple of stories off the top of my head.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_101%	I've been put through hell.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_104%	In any case, I already told you I feel alone and that I would love to have friends to share things with.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_105%	Yes, but I wouldn't have guessed that you would be interested in the friendship of a "lesser being" like me.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_106%	I was imagining you in a godlike gang, discussing the intricacies of the cosmos beyond the limitations of language.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_108%	Ha ha ha ha ha.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_110%	That would be very interesting, indeed.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_112%	But I enjoy your company a lot.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_116%	You are trying to seduce me.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_118%	Ha ha ha ha ha!
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_120%	Hitting on me through the cards, aren't you?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_121%	I... No!
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_122%	I swear this is the card's message.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_123%	Don't try to dodge the bullet.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_124%	What is this about?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_126%	I admit I have a strong fetish for Witches.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_128%	Ugh... creepy.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_129%	It's not like that.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_130%	I'm not talking about sex... (exclusively).
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_131%	There is something tense and stimulating about becoming a Witch's servant.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_133%	Your desires are always so... colorful.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_134%	I just can't get enough of the rush that comes from satisfying a Witch.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_135%	Still sounds perverted to me.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_137%	I won't argue that it's never a perversion.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_138%	I am lucky my abilities are so tempting for your kind.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_139%	I'm eager to see how our time together will play out.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_141%	I predict that you're destined to stir things up. Dramatically.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_142%	You sure love drama.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_144%	Ha ha ha ha ha!
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_146%	It's what makes existence worthwhile.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_148%	I am a bit scared now, actually...
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_149%	Just a bit?
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_150%	...
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_153%	I already confessed that I have a thing for Witches.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_154%	Most of the time I fall in love with whoever summons me.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_155%	And you... Fortuna.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_156%	I just love your bossy attitude.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_157%	I don't know if I like where this is going...
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_159%	Ah... don't worry about it.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_160%	I won't push things.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_161%	I'm used to enjoying love from a distance.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_162%	Not that I'm in love right now, by the way.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_164%	I'm only playing around.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_165%	Well, let's take things slow.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_167%	I'm no stranger to magical intercourse with cosmic entities, just so you know.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_168%	But I'd rather focus on my training right now.
%spread_abramar_second_behaviour_169%	Understood.
%spread_abramar_second_followup_3%	You went in for the kill with this reading, didn't you?
%spread_abramar_second_followup_4%	That's my divination style.
%spread_abramar_second_followup_5%	If we don't dig into the intense stuff we might as well just have a normal conversation.
%spread_abramar_second_followup_7%	You're absolutely right.
%spread_abramar_second_followup_8%	I can see I won't get bored with you.
%spread_abramar_second_followup_10%	What now?
%spread_abramar_second_followup_11%	I'm the one that needs some rest after today's session...
%spread_abramar_second_followup_12%	Go and review what we've studied so far and get ready for tomorrow's lesson.
%spread_abramar_second_followup_13%	Fire is the last seal, and also the most trying of the energies.
%spread_abramar_second_followup_14%	Very well.
%third_dream_1_2%	Were you the leader of your coven, how would you punish someone for having summoned Ábramar?
%third_dream_1_3%	Would exile suffice? Would you be able to forgive something like this?
%third_dream_1_4%	...Or maybe...you would think it worthy of death?
%third_dream_2_2%	Do you believe your friends will understand why you summoned a forbidden Behemoth?
%third_dream_2_3%	Will they tell on you to the coven?
%third_dream_2_4%	Had you discovered through your fortune telling that a fellow Witch had broken this same rule...
%third_dream_2_5%	You would have reported her, wouldn't you?
%lesson_conflict_2%	Ready for more?
%lesson_conflict_3%	Yes.
%lesson_conflict_4%	How have you found the ceremony so far?
%lesson_conflict_5%	Do you want to review any elements before continuing?
%lesson_conflict_6%	Mmm...
%lesson_conflict_7%	I don't think so. It was pretty basic stuff.
%lesson_conflict_8%	Understood.
%lesson_conflict_9%	What's the matter?
%lesson_conflict_10%	You're not as chipper as usual.
%lesson_conflict_11%	Ah... yes, I'm sorry.
%lesson_conflict_12%	Fire is usually my favorite lesson.
%lesson_conflict_13%	And it marks the final step before our contract becomes effective, which I'm looking forward to.
%lesson_conflict_14%	...
%lesson_conflict_15%	But...?
%lesson_conflict_16%	I have a bad feeling about this.
%lesson_conflict_17%	That's odd. Based on your act and all so far, I thought you enjoyed the threat of dire consequences.
%lesson_conflict_18%	Oh, of course I do. That kind of adrenaline is my favorite thing in the cosmos.
%lesson_conflict_19%	What is it then?
%lesson_conflict_20%	Look, you're right, I better stop dwelling on silly worries and focus on our training.
%lesson_conflict_21%	I'm just moody for some reason.
%lesson_conflict_22%	It's not silly! What do you say we look into it with our cards after we finish today's session?
%lesson_conflict_23%	That... might be a good idea.
%lesson_conflict_24%	That's one of the perks of being summoned by a fortune teller.
%lesson_conflict_26%	Ha ha ha ha ha!
%lesson_conflict_28%	So true.
%lesson_conflict_29%	You're on. It'll be a good challenge as the final test for this new deck.
%lesson_conflict_31%	That's the Ábramar I know.
%lesson_conflict_32%	I need you sharp for the final lesson.
%lesson_conflict_34%	Fire it is then!
%lesson_conflict_36%	This element is usually feared by most and yearnt for by those with ill will.
%lesson_conflict_37%	But Fire is more versatile than most magic practitioners think it is.
%lesson_conflict_38%	Fire represents adversity, battle, everything that is against you.
%lesson_conflict_39%	Fire is challenge, intimidation, the fuel of every battle.
%lesson_conflict_40%	Fire is your wrath, Fire is...
%lesson_conflict_41%	Conflict.
%lesson_conflict_42%	Exactly.
%lesson_conflict_43%	But don't just dwell on the negative aspects of that definition.
%lesson_conflict_44%	Conflict also means growth. The only time Fire is bad is when you're on the losing side.
%lesson_conflict_45%	And even in defeat there's a great deal of growth.
%lesson_conflict_47%	We are the living example of that, haha.
%lesson_conflict_48%	Master your Fire and you will conquer anything the cosmos throws at you.
%lesson_conflict_50%	To tell you the truth, I'm more intimidated by Water.
%lesson_conflict_51%	I'm actually quite fond of Fire.
%lesson_conflict_53%	Ha ha ha ha ha.
%lesson_conflict_55%	Maybe that's why we get along so well.
%lesson_conflict_57%	Now, the final contract.
%lesson_conflict_58%	This answer will affect your fate. Profoundly.
%lesson_conflict_63%	For the Fire Seal: What will you sacrifice to access my magic?
%lesson_conflict_66%	My immortality.
%lesson_conflict_67%	The coven.
%lesson_conflict_68%	The life of whoever I love the most.
%lesson_conflict_73%	My immortality.
%lesson_conflict_74%	Oh, wow... are you sure about that?
%lesson_conflict_75%	You'll live a maximum of another sixty years after you pay the price.
%lesson_conflict_76%	Plus, you won't be able to live in space anymore. You'll have to go down to Earth and live among humans.
%lesson_conflict_81%	The coven.
%lesson_conflict_82%	Wow, that is brutal.
%lesson_conflict_83%	Why? It doesn't mean they'll all die. They could just disband, right?
%lesson_conflict_84%	Yes. Or they could be absorbed by a more powerful coven.
%lesson_conflict_85%	Or they could all fuse into a single all-too-powerful Witch. I've seen it happen.
%lesson_conflict_86%	There are many possibilities. But still, to use everyone you know as a payment is wild.
%lesson_conflict_91%	The life of whoever I love the most.
%lesson_conflict_93%	Uh, that's a harsh one.
%lesson_conflict_94%	I've seen other Witches choose to sacrifice the person they love and it always hurts more than they expected.
%lesson_conflict_95%	This will leave an everlasting dent in your soul.
%lesson_conflict_98%	Wow, you are twisted.
%lesson_conflict_99%	You plan to pay with something you are set to gain through the Water seal.
%lesson_conflict_100%	Uh...
%lesson_conflict_101%	I'm ok with it. And it's not against the rules.
%lesson_conflict_102%	Don't worry, it will hurt the same...
%lesson_conflict_103%	Or even more, because you'll start to suffer the very moment you fall in love, knowing you condemned that person to die for you.
%lesson_conflict_107%	Do you want to reconsider?
%lesson_conflict_110%	Mmm... Yes... Let me answer differently.
%lesson_conflict_111%	No. This is my final answer.
%lesson_conflict_115%	Mmm... Yes... Let me answer differently.
%lesson_conflict_119%	No. This is my final answer.
%lesson_conflict_120%	As you wish.
%lesson_conflict_121%	I will etch your decision into the Cosmic Wheel and pray it doesn't break you apart when the time comes to pay the price.
%lesson_conflict_122%	Brace yourself.
%seal_fire_2%	A-agh... can't... breathe.
%seal_fire_4%	THIS PAIN. IT BURNS.
%seal_fire_5%	It's breaking my atoms apart! I love it!
%seal_fire_6%	Áb... H-help... me.
%seal_fire_8%	Fortuna?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2%	Wake up.
%seal_fire_wakeup_3%	Fortuna, wake up.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_2%	What... what happened?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_3%	Sorry, I had to wake you up. You've been asleep for a couple of days.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_4%	You dropped dead after we sealed the Fire contract.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_5%	I thought it might be too much, so I let you rest.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_6%	I feel dizzy...
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_7%	I had the weirdest dreams.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_8%	Oh yeah? What about?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_9%	Can't remember, but it felt premonitory.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_10%	I feel bad for waking you up, but you have some business to attend to.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_11%	What do you mean?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_12%	Look at the window. You've got a visitor.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_14%	That falcon... that's a familiar from an Arbiter.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_15%	What's an Arbiter?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_16%	The Arbitrage Office is an organism composed of former Witches, unaffiliated with any Coven, that ensures no Witch is operating outside the laws of the Magical Pact.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_17%	They also rule over conflicts between different covens, and rarely interfere with internal affairs.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_18%	It was founded about four thousand years ago... so it makes sense you don't know them?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_19%	Yeah, this happened during my slumber. Why were they created?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_20%	Well... Both the Arbiters and the Magical Pact were created after an especially bloody Witch war that ended with our coven burning eighty-seven Witches inside of a white star.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_21%	Brutal.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_22%	To avoid future atrocities, some Witches vowed to stop using magic and focus exclusively on keeping the peace.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_23%	In the beginning, it was a group of devotees who wanted to avoid tragedy, but nowadays it's mainly composed of outcasts that have to serve The Arbitrage Office as a life-long punishment.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_24%	Wow, things have gotten a lot bleaker since I was last put to sleep.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_25%	This all happened before my time, but I'm more afraid of having Witch wars than Witch cops.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_26%	And what do you think the Arbiter wants?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_27%	Maybe they noticed I summoned you?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_28%	That's impossible, my arts are untraceable.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_29%	Then there's only one way to find out.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_30%	Let's invite her over.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_31%	Sure. I'll make myself invisible whenever you get a visit.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_32%	Also, you have some energy pooled from sealing the Fire contract, in case you want to expand your deck before inviting the Arbiter over.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_33%	Ok. Plus I still owe you a reading, right?
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_34%	Ah, don't worry about it. There will be time for that.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_35%	Ok, ok, but you're not off the hook.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_36%	We'll look into what worries you, eventually.
%seal_fire_wakeup_2_37%	As if I could escape you...
%arbiter_visit_2%	Thanks for having me. My name is Théa, Arbiter badge 210.
%arbiter_visit_3%	Thank you for coming, Arbiter.
%arbiter_visit_4%	I really appreciate the Office paying attention to my case.
%arbiter_visit_5%	I've been isolated for two hundred years so far...
%arbiter_visit_6%	That's precisely why I'm here.
%arbiter_visit_7%	The Arbitrage Office recently discovered your situation and we are worried it may go awry for the community.
%arbiter_visit_8%	Excessive punishments beget rancor... and a thousand-year long exile? That's the perfect recipe to build up a lot of bad blood.
%arbiter_visit_10%	And we all know what a Witch can do with a surplus of bad blood...
%arbiter_visit_11%	...
%arbiter_visit_13%	But I am here to help you!
%arbiter_visit_14%	Let me know about your case, and we'll look for a way to make you feel better.
%arbiter_visit_16%	Thank you.
%arbiter_visit_17%	I already had a meeting with Aedana, the leader of your Witch clan.
%arbiter_visit_18%	Aedana told me that you predicted the fall of your coven.
%arbiter_visit_19%	She explained to me that she didn't punish you for that, though. She punished you because of how you handled it.
%arbiter_visit_20%	Apparently, you plunged the coven into chaos. Giving ill advice to any Witch, telling them to prepare for the end times.
%arbiter_visit_21%	And those actions almost destroyed the coven before its time.
%arbiter_visit_22%	So she decided to exile you and deprive you of your deck so you can meditate on the range and meaning of your powers.
%arbiter_visit_23%	...
%arbiter_visit_24%	Now, that's the official version. I'm interested in what you have to say.
%arbiter_visit_25%	Do you think what you did was wrong?
%arbiter_visit_28%	No. A premonition that grave should be disclosed to the community.
%arbiter_visit_29%	Yes. I should have gone to Aedana first.
%arbiter_visit_34%	No. A premonition that grave should be disclosed to the community.
%arbiter_visit_36%	You don't agree with your leader's judgment...
%arbiter_visit_38%	That is not dangerous per se, but it's a bad ingredient to add to the pot of imprisonment.
%arbiter_visit_39%	What would you have done, then? If the end were nigh, you'd like to know, right?
%arbiter_visit_40%	I shouldn't give my opinion. I have to act as a neutral party, Fortuna!
%arbiter_visit_44%	Yes. I should have gone to Aedana first.
%arbiter_visit_46%	You acknowledge your leader's wisdom, that makes things easier...
%arbiter_visit_49%	Next question.
%arbiter_visit_50%	Do you think your punishment is fair?
%arbiter_visit_53%	Absolutely not. This is way too excessive.
%arbiter_visit_54%	(Lie.) Yes, I trust Aedana's judgment.
%arbiter_visit_58%	Absolutely not. This is way too excessive.
%arbiter_visit_60%	I understand. Hardly anyone would accept this kind of sentence.
%arbiter_visit_64%	Yes, I trust Aedana's judgment.
%arbiter_visit_67%	You seem suspiciously compliant for someone sent to exile...
%arbiter_visit_69%	You don't need to put on a good act with me.
%arbiter_visit_72%	It's totally understandable if you feel angry or mistreated.
%arbiter_visit_73%	Plus you are a Witch deprived of her powers. I can relate to that...
%arbiter_visit_75%	That takes me to my last and most important question.
%arbiter_visit_80%	It's not a good idea to lie to The Arbitrage Office, Fortuna...
%arbiter_visit_82%	You just said that you don't think you did anything wrong.
%arbiter_visit_83%	You can't possibly think your punishment is fair.
%arbiter_visit_87%	How are you coping with centuries of isolation?
%arbiter_visit_90%	This is horrible. Help me, please...
%arbiter_visit_91%	At first it was hard, but now I think I can manage.
%arbiter_visit_95%	This is horrible. Help me, please...
%arbiter_visit_96%	Oh no!
%arbiter_visit_98%	We need to fix your situation. Top priority.
%arbiter_visit_99%	Thank you...
%arbiter_visit_101%	I think we can at least alleviate your sentence, somehow.
%arbiter_visit_105%	At first, it was hard, but now I think I can manage.
%arbiter_visit_107%	Wow! You are strong.
%arbiter_visit_109%	I'll see what I can do to improve your situation...
%arbiter_visit_112%	I can leave less worried about you doing something drastic, right?
%arbiter_visit_113%	Yes, I believe so.
%arbiter_visit_117%	Although I'll take your testimony with a grain of salt...
%arbiter_visit_119%	Since you've been caught red handed lying to an Arbiter, my Office will consider you a potential danger...
%arbiter_visit_120%	I'm sorry, Fortuna.
%arbiter_visit_121%	Can't you just do me a favor and fix my testimony? I was nervous, I'm sorry.
%arbiter_visit_122%	I'm afraid I can't do that.
%arbiter_visit_123%	Arbitrage forms are updated in the Master Grimoire as soon as my pen touches the paper to avoid situations like this...
%arbiter_visit_124%	Ugh. I really messed up, then.
%arbiter_visit_125%	I'm so sorry.
%arbiter_visit_127%	I still plan on improving your situation, though!
%arbiter_visit_130%	I still don't understand why Aedana deprived you of your Tarot deck...
%arbiter_visit_131%	I mean, if you're isolated, what does she care if you have your magic or not?
%arbiter_visit_132%	That's something I'm supposed to reflect on while exiled.
%arbiter_visit_133%	It's a pity, because I'd have loved to have my fortune read.
%arbiter_visit_134%	Anyway...
%arbiter_visit_135%	Before I leave, as an Arbiter I'm obliged to ask:
%arbiter_visit_136%	Anything to confess?
%arbiter_visit_139%	Actually... I'm crafting a new deck for divination.
%arbiter_visit_140%	No. Nothing.
%arbiter_visit_144%	Actually... I am crafting a new deck for divination.
%arbiter_visit_145%	Oh! Wow!
%arbiter_visit_147%	That's bold...
%arbiter_visit_148%	But I don't think what you're doing is illegal.
%arbiter_visit_150%	Aedana took your Tarot deck from you, but she doesn't have authority over your new creations... yet.
%arbiter_visit_151%	I'm sure she won't be happy to hear it, though.
%arbiter_visit_152%	You don't need to report to Aedana, right? I trust in the Office's neutrality.
%arbiter_visit_153%	Of course. Unless you break the Magical Pact or it becomes relevant during a trial, we won't disclose sensitive information from our investigation.
%arbiter_visit_154%	In any case, what I'm crafting isn't a Tarot deck. It's something new.
%arbiter_visit_155%	Oh! Really!?
%arbiter_visit_156%	Can... Can I see it?
%arbiter_visit_157%	Would you like a reading?
%arbiter_visit_159%	Ahem... as an Arbiter it is my duty to make sure that your new project doesn't break the Magical Pact, so...
%arbiter_visit_161%	I would love a reading very much, yes, please.
%arbiter_visit_162%	It'll be my pleasure.
%arbiter_visit_167%	No. Nothing.
%arbiter_noconfess_5%	That's all good, then...
%arbiter_noconfess_7%	You know, Fortuna.
%arbiter_noconfess_8%	My Arbiter's senses tell me you are a talented, brave, and intelligent Witch.
%arbiter_noconfess_10%	It's a shame you're separated from the community.
%arbiter_noconfess_11%	I've interviewed hundreds of Witches so I have a good instinct for this kind of stuff.
%arbiter_noconfess_12%	Your skills are wasted on this forsaken rock.
%arbiter_noconfess_14%	Now, as an Arbiter, I can't simply overrule Aedana's sentence, but...
%arbiter_noconfess_16%	I am going to lift the ban on visitation.
%arbiter_noconfess_17%	Wow... can you really do that?
%arbiter_noconfess_19%	I just requested a permit from the main office.
%arbiter_noconfess_20%	It'll become effective as soon as my Arbiter's Notebook gets updated with a Moonstamp.
%arbiter_noconfess_22%	Arbitrage forms are updated in the Master Grimoire as soon as my pen touches the paper.
%arbiter_noconfess_23%	All of what I've written so far is already in the Office archives.
%arbiter_noconfess_25%	You girls sure are efficient, eh?
%arbiter_noconfess_26%	There are Witch Covens all around the universe. We can’t afford to be going back and forth to the Moon Temple all the time.
%arbiter_noconfess_27%	Makes sense.
%arbiter_noconfess_29%	And it's official!
%arbiter_noconfess_30%	You can now receive guests to your cute asteroid home!
%arbiter_noconfess_31%	Ah... this makes me happier than I can express.
%arbiter_noconfess_32%	Teeheehee...
%arbiter_noconfess_33%	You deserve this! I'm just happy to ease your pain!
%arbiter_noconfess_34%	Thank you so much.
%arbiter_noconfess_35%	I'm just doing my job!
%arbiter_noconfess_36%	Do you want me to let your coven know?
%arbiter_noconfess_37%	Mmm... Just let Jasmine and Dahlia know for now.
%arbiter_noconfess_38%	I'm not ready to go public yet. It's been two hundred years...
%arbiter_noconfess_40%	I understand.
%arbiter_noconfess_42%	I'll send a Falcon to each of them.
%arbiter_noconfess_43%	Thanks again.
%arbiter_noconfess_44%	Well, I should be going now.
%arbiter_noconfess_45%	It's been a pleasure to meet you.
%arbiter_noconfess_46%	Take care.
%arbiter_noconfess_47%	Let me know if there's any trouble!
%arbiter_noconfess_48%	Bye!
%arbiter_noconfess_54%	I wasn't implying that you're guilty of anything, ah...
%arbiter_noconfess_56%	It's just Arbiter protocol to ask this before closing an interview.
%arbiter_noconfess_57%	It's nothing personal. Don't be mad at me, please.
%arbiter_noconfess_58%	I understand.
%arbiter_noconfess_59%	I am sorry if I offended you or made you uncomfortable during our interview.
%arbiter_noconfess_63%	I didn't mean to call you a liar, I just wanted to point out a little inconsistency in your testimony.
%arbiter_noconfess_64%	I am so sorry.
%arbiter_noconfess_66%	Would you let me make it up to you?
%arbiter_noconfess_67%	How?
%arbiter_noconfess_69%	I'll put in a request to lift your ban on visitation.
%arbiter_noconfess_70%	Whoa... can you really do that?
%arbiter_noconfess_72%	Ah... yes. I'm not breaking a rule or anything! I just requested a permit from the main office.
%arbiter_noconfess_73%	It'll become effective as soon as my Arbiter's Notebook gets updated with a Moonstamp.
%arbiter_noconfess_75%	Arbitrage forms are updated in the Master Grimoire as soon as my pen touches the paper.
%arbiter_noconfess_76%	All of what I've written so far is already in the Office archives.
%arbiter_noconfess_78%	Talk about efficiency.
%arbiter_noconfess_79%	Ah... haha... Yes. There are Witch Covens all around the universe, so we can't afford to be going back and forth to the Moon Temple all the time.
%arbiter_noconfess_80%	Makes sense.
%arbiter_noconfess_82%	And it's official.
%arbiter_noconfess_83%	You can now receive guests. I hope that helps.
%arbiter_noconfess_84%	This... makes me happier than I can express.
%arbiter_noconfess_86%	Really!? Ah... that's good.
%arbiter_noconfess_87%	Thank you so much.
%arbiter_noconfess_88%	I'm just doing my job, haha...
%arbiter_noconfess_89%	Do you want me to let your coven know?
%arbiter_noconfess_90%	Mmm... Just let Jasmine and Dahlia know for now.
%arbiter_noconfess_91%	I'm not ready to go public yet. It's been two hundred years...
%arbiter_noconfess_93%	I understand.
%arbiter_noconfess_95%	I'll send a Falcon to each of them.
%arbiter_noconfess_96%	Thanks again.
%arbiter_noconfess_97%	Well, I should be going now.
%arbiter_noconfess_98%	Thank you for your time.
%arbiter_noconfess_99%	Take care.
%arbiter_noconfess_100%	Let me know if you face any... inconvenience... ok?
%arbiter_noconfess_101%	Bye!
%arbiter_noconfess_107%	Of course, what harm could you do trapped on this tiny rock, anyway...
%arbiter_noconfess_109%	Ah... I feel so bad for you.
%arbiter_noconfess_110%	I'm sure you didn't mean any harm to your coven.
%arbiter_noconfess_111%	No one with good intentions should receive a punishment this severe...
%arbiter_noconfess_113%	You know what, this isn't fair.
%arbiter_noconfess_115%	I'm going to lift the ban on visitation.
%arbiter_noconfess_116%	Wow... can you really do that?
%arbiter_noconfess_118%	I just requested a permit from the main office.
%arbiter_noconfess_119%	It'll become effective as soon as my Arbiter's Notebook gets updated with a Moonstamp.
%arbiter_noconfess_121%	Arbitrage forms are updated in the Master Grimoire as soon as my pen touches the paper.
%arbiter_noconfess_122%	All of what I've written so far is already in the Office archives.
%arbiter_noconfess_124%	You girls sure are efficient, eh?
%arbiter_noconfess_125%	There are Witch Covens all around the universe, so we can't afford to be going back and forth to the Moon Temple all the time.
%arbiter_noconfess_126%	Makes sense.
%arbiter_noconfess_128%	And it's official!
%arbiter_noconfess_129%	You can now receive guests to your cute asteroid home!
%arbiter_noconfess_130%	Ah... this makes me happier than I can express.
%arbiter_noconfess_131%	Aaaw...
%arbiter_noconfess_132%	I can't let you rot here all alone.
%arbiter_noconfess_133%	Thank you so much.
%arbiter_noconfess_134%	No worries. I just had to. You don't deserve this.
%arbiter_noconfess_135%	Do you want me to let your coven know?
%arbiter_noconfess_136%	Mmm... Just let Jasmine and Dahlia know for now.
%arbiter_noconfess_137%	I'm not ready to go public yet. It's been two hundred years...
%arbiter_noconfess_139%	Poor thing... Isolation must have done a number on you.
%arbiter_noconfess_141%	Don't worry. I'll send a Falcon to each of them.
%arbiter_noconfess_142%	Thanks again.
%arbiter_noconfess_143%	Well, I'm so sorry, but I should be going now.
%arbiter_noconfess_144%	It's been a pleasure to meet you.
%arbiter_noconfess_145%	Take care.
%arbiter_noconfess_146%	Please, let me know if you need anything. I'm here to help.
%arbiter_noconfess_147%	Bye!
%spread_arbiter_intro_2%	Is there something you want to ask the deck?
%spread_arbiter_intro_3%	Mmm... I want to know what's in the future regarding my career as an Arbiter.
%spread_arbiter_intro_4%	Very well...
%spread_arbiter_intro_5%	I'm going to draw two cards for you.
%spread_arbiter_intro_6%	The first one to look for opportunities and good omens.
%spread_arbiter_intro_8%	And the second one to warn you about possible challenges or adversities.
%spread_arbiter_intro_11%	Uhh... That's scary.
%spread_arbiter_intro_12%	Would you prefer not to know?
%spread_arbiter_intro_14%	No! Please, go ahead.
%spread_arbiter_intro_15%	Alright, here we go.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_6%	You'll make a very important arrest. It'll be someone from my coven.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_8%	Oh, no! I'm so sorry!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_9%	Don't be! We're reading "The Good," remember?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_10%	I'm sure whoever you arrest will deserve it, and that you will make our coven a better place.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_11%	Ah... I've never arrested someone before.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_12%	I hope you're right.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_14%	This will be a great opportunity for you.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_15%	Just be sure to make the most of it.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_18%	Ok, I will. Thank you.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_22%	Hey, maybe this means I'll avoid killing that Witch?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_23%	I'm sorry, but my cards don't cancel each other out...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_24%	So you're going to arrest a Witch and then kill another.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_25%	That's just so terrible...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_26%	I think that as an Arbiter it was bound to happen.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_27%	This will just mean that you're getting more... experienced.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_28%	I just hope it's all for the betterment of our community...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_30%	I'll do my best.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_33%	I just hope that this arrest isn't what leads us to war...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_34%	It won't be.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_35%	This reading is for "The Good."
%spread_arbiter_thegood_37%	Ok, ok...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_42%	In the future, you and I will become allies.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_43%	Oh! Really?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_44%	That's what the cards said.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_45%	Since it came up in "The Good" slot, I'm sure this alliance is going to be very fruitful.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_46%	Or at least it will be for you, since it's your fortune we're reading.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_47%	I'll make sure this is something good for both of us!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_48%	I will never deceive someone who helped me.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_49%	Provided you don't break the law, of course...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_50%	Ha, ha... I know, I know.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_55%	You are going to be promoted to a higher rank.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_56%	Oh! Why?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_57%	Can't really tell why or how, but I'm pretty sure you will be promoted in the Arbitrage Office.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_58%	I'm not really due a promotion until I do five more years of service, though...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_59%	What I'm reading is a lot closer than that.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_60%	Wow. How is that possible?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_61%	The cards didn't say, but you'll earn it by doing something important.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_64%	Congrats.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_65%	Aaah... Now I'm all nervous thinking about what it's gonna be...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_66%	Just be ready for any opportunity and do your best.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_67%	Understood!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_70%	For example, killing that Witch.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_72%	But that's horrible!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_73%	If you get a promotion it is because you did something good.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_74%	It may be tough, but you will be protecting us all.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_75%	Ah... I need to be stronger for this line of work.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_76%	I believe in you.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_78%	Ah... Thanks. That means a lot.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_82%	I see...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_83%	According to the other card it's most likely I'll get promoted for some kind of combat merit...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_84%	I don't like this.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_85%	Becoming a war hero sounds pretty rad to me.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_86%	I'd rather stay a humble Arbiter in a peaceful universe.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_87%	I understand. I'm sorry.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_89%	In any case, I'll do my best to protect you all.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_90%	You're so brave. Thank you.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_95%	You are going to play a crucial role in future politics within the Witch community.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_97%	What? I shouldn't!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_98%	We Arbiters are a neutral party!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_99%	Maybe it's something that falls into your line of duty.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_100%	Maybe your splendid job as an Arbiter puts something misshapen back on track?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_102%	Ah! That's great to hear!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_103%	This is all speculation at this point.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_104%	But what the cards let me see clearly is that it is specifically you who'll play a crucial role in the future.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_107%	Ah, the pressure... ok, ok. I'm looking forward to it!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_111%	Oh, no...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_112%	What if the killing you predicted is some kind of political assassination ordered by the Arbitrage Office?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_113%	Do they do that kind of stuff?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_114%	Ah! No! Of course not!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_116%	What was I thinking? Hahaha.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_117%	I watched too much mortal TV back in my Witch days.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_121%	Oh, no...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_122%	What if I'm the one who triggers the war?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_123%	I don't believe that's it.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_124%	This is a reading for "The Good," remember?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_125%	I'm confident you'll have a positive impact, whatever it is.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_126%	Believe in yourself.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_128%	Alright.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_129%	I'll stay vigilant and proactive!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_130%	That's the spirit.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_135%	You are going to meet someone really special that's going to change your life.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_137%	Oh, no!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_138%	"Oh, no"?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_139%	We Arbiters can't be in a relationship!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_140%	It doesn't have to mean a romance, necessarily.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_141%	It could well be a figure so inspiring that they make you a better Arbiter.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_142%	Or reconnecting with a long-lost friend.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_143%	I can't afford to fall in love! Please, help me!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_144%	But I said...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_145%	All of those options feel like falling in love!
%spread_arbiter_thegood_146%	Aren't you the amorous one, huh?
%spread_arbiter_thegood_147%	Ah...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_148%	Dating is the thing I miss the most from my life before becoming an Arbiter.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_149%	Ah, well...
%spread_arbiter_thegood_151%	I'll be strong.
%spread_arbiter_thegood_152%	Ha, ha, ha.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_6%	I see War. You will be sent into combat.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_8%	What!? What do you mean War?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_9%	I can see a high scale conflict that will require Arbiters to go into battle.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_10%	Oh my god! But that is huge! I have to warn everyone!
%spread_arbiter_thebad_11%	No! Wait!
%spread_arbiter_thebad_12%	Don't do that. I have experience in ringing the catastrophe bells and it doesn't bring any good.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_13%	But I can't just do nothing about it...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_14%	Let the higher ups know... and no one else.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_15%	And keep my name off the record if you can...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_16%	Uh... Ok...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_17%	I don't know if I'll be able to do that... but I'll protect "my source" as much as I can, I promise.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_18%	Thank you.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_19%	Oh my... War...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_23%	Ok. I'll protect you all. That is our duty.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_24%	Thank you.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_27%	Maybe military achievements are how you'll get promoted?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_28%	Maybe... It'd make sense...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_33%	You will suffer a critical, permanent, injury or wound.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_35%	No! Why!?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_36%	I can't really tell how...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_37%	But be careful, I can tell it'll be violent.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_38%	There's no way to avoid it?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_39%	I'm sorry, but no.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_40%	The best you can do is prepare for it.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_41%	...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_43%	Understood. I'll focus on training my combat skills.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_44%	It comes with the job... I guess...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_45%	Be strong.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_50%	Oh, my... You are going to kill a Witch.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_52%	Me!? That's impossible!
%spread_arbiter_thebad_53%	Is there any scenario in which an Arbiter could take down a Witch?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_55%	Well, yes.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_56%	I mean, it's super rare.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_57%	That Witch would have to be caught doing something terrible.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_58%	Like... being on an uncontrollable murder rampage...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_59%	...or being about to summon a forbidden Behemoth, I don't know.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_60%	Ah... haha, that would be awful, yes.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_61%	And that's as a last resort. We should always attempt arrest first.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_62%	That's good to know.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_63%	If I find myself in the situation you foresee, I'll do my best to avoid casualties, I promise.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_64%	I don't know if this is something avoidable, but... do your best.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_65%	Understood.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_69%	Maybe that's how you'll get your promotion?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_70%	Mmm... Well, if I avoid a major catastrophe, it is possible, yes.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_71%	Still, it'll be my last resort.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_72%	I wouldn't like to add taking down a Witch to my résumé...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_77%	Don't worry, everything's going to be alright.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_78%	Oh? That's it?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_79%	What can I say? Some people are born under a lucky star.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_80%	I wouldn't call myself a lucky person, though.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_81%	If I was, I wouldn't have ended up as an Arbiter.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_82%	Why do you say that? Aren't you happy?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_83%	Well, I do enjoy my job...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_84%	But I didn't willingly become an Arbiter.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_85%	I miss so many things from being a normal Witch...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_86%	Like... dating and all that, you know?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_87%	I'm sorry.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_88%	It's alright, it's what I deserve.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_89%	Can I ask why?
%spread_arbiter_thebad_90%	Actually... you can't.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_91%	An Arbiter's background is classified.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_92%	Oh, I see...
%spread_arbiter_thebad_93%	Happy to know nothing grave will happen in the near future, anyway.
%spread_arbiter_thebad_94%	Thank you.
%spread_arbiter_followup_2%	Well, what do you think of my new deck?
%spread_arbiter_followup_4%	Mmm...
%arbiter_confess_4%	That was amazing!
%arbiter_confess_6%	And a bit scary...
%arbiter_confess_8%	But mostly amazing!
%arbiter_confess_9%	Thank you.
%arbiter_confess_10%	Your gift could be a very valuable asset for our Office.
%arbiter_confess_11%	It's a crime that you're imprisoned here!
%arbiter_confess_12%	Well, ah... I shouldn't position myself in such matters.
%arbiter_confess_13%	At least not that strongly, hehe...
%arbiter_confess_14%	In any case, it's an objective truth that your skills are wasted on this forsaken rock.
%arbiter_confess_15%	Now, as an Arbiter, I can't simply overrule Aedana's sentence, but...
%arbiter_confess_17%	I am going to lift the ban on visitation.
%arbiter_confess_18%	Wow... can you really do that?
%arbiter_confess_20%	I just requested a permit from the main office.
%arbiter_confess_21%	It'll become effective as soon as my Arbiter's Notebook gets updated with a Moonstamp.
%arbiter_confess_23%	Arbitrage forms are updated in the Master Grimoire as soon as my pen touches the paper.
%arbiter_confess_24%	All of what I've written so far is already in the Office archives.
%arbiter_confess_26%	You girls sure are efficient, eh?
%arbiter_confess_27%	There are Witch covens all around the universe, we can't afford to be traveling back and forth to the Moon Temple all the time.
%arbiter_confess_28%	Makes sense.
%arbiter_confess_30%	And it's official!
%arbiter_confess_31%	You can now receive guests on your cute asteroid home!
%arbiter_confess_32%	Ah... this makes me happier than I can express.
%arbiter_confess_33%	Teeheehee...
%arbiter_confess_34%	You deserve this! I'm just happy to ease your pain!
%arbiter_confess_35%	Thank you so much.
%arbiter_confess_36%	I'm just doing my job!
%arbiter_confess_37%	Do you want me to let your coven know?
%arbiter_confess_38%	Mmm... Just let Jasmine and Dahlia know for now.
%arbiter_confess_39%	I'm not ready to go public yet. It's been two hundred years...
%arbiter_confess_41%	I understand.
%arbiter_confess_43%	I'll send a Falcon to each of them.
%arbiter_confess_44%	Thanks again.
%arbiter_confess_45%	Well, I should be going now.
%arbiter_confess_46%	It's been a pleasure to meet you. And thanks for the reading.
%arbiter_confess_51%	Take care.
%arbiter_confess_52%	Let me know if there's any trouble!
%arbiter_confess_53%	Bye!
%arbiter_confess_59%	Even if it was so ominous...
%arbiter_confess_67%	Well, I can see you are a formidable Witch.
%arbiter_confess_68%	Now I understand why Aedana would be afraid of you...
%arbiter_confess_69%	That wasn't my intention... I'm sorry.
%arbiter_confess_70%	No, no!
%arbiter_confess_71%	I'm the one that's sorry.
%arbiter_confess_72%	I hope I didn't offend you during the interview...
%arbiter_confess_76%	I didn't mean to call you a liar, I just wanted to point out a little inconsistency in your testimony.
%arbiter_confess_77%	I am so sorry.
%arbiter_confess_79%	Would you let me make it up to you?
%arbiter_confess_80%	Mmm? What do you mean?
%arbiter_confess_82%	I'll put in a request to lift your ban on visitation.
%arbiter_confess_83%	Whoa... can you really do that?
%arbiter_confess_85%	Ah... yes. I'm not breaking a rule or anything! I just requested a permit from the main office.
%arbiter_confess_86%	It'll become effective as soon as my Arbiter's Notebook gets updated with a Moonstamp.
%arbiter_confess_88%	Arbitrage forms are updated in the Master Grimoire as soon as my pen touches the paper.
%arbiter_confess_89%	All of what I've written so far is already in the Office archives.
%arbiter_confess_91%	Talk about efficiency.
%arbiter_confess_92%	Ah... haha... Yes. There are Witch covens all around the universe, we can't afford to be traveling back and forth to the Moon Temple all the time.
%arbiter_confess_93%	Makes sense.
%arbiter_confess_95%	And it's official.
%arbiter_confess_96%	You can now receive guests. I hope that helps.
%arbiter_confess_97%	This... makes me happier than I can express.
%arbiter_confess_99%	Really!? Ah... that's good.
%arbiter_confess_100%	Thank you so much.
%arbiter_confess_101%	I'm just doing my job, haha...
%arbiter_confess_102%	Do you want me to let your coven know?
%arbiter_confess_103%	Mmm... Just let Jasmine and Dahlia know for now.
%arbiter_confess_104%	I'm not ready to go public yet. It's been two hundred years...
%arbiter_confess_106%	I understand.
%arbiter_confess_108%	I'll send a Falcon to each of them.
%arbiter_confess_109%	Thanks again.
%arbiter_confess_110%	Well, I should be going now.
%arbiter_confess_111%	Thank you for your time. And thank you for letting me experience your powers...
%arbiter_confess_116%	Take care.
%arbiter_confess_117%	Let me know if you face any... inconvenience... ok?
%arbiter_confess_118%	Bye!
%arbiter_confess_123%	That was just great. I really loved it.
%arbiter_confess_124%	You are a very special Witch, Fortuna.
%arbiter_confess_126%	I'm sorry that you're enduring such a difficult punishment.
%arbiter_confess_127%	I can tell you're a beautiful person and that you didn't mean any evil with your divination.
%arbiter_confess_128%	No one with good intentions should receive a punishment this severe...
%arbiter_confess_130%	You know what, this isn't fair.
%arbiter_confess_132%	I'm going to lift the ban on visitation.
%arbiter_confess_133%	Wow... can you really do that?
%arbiter_confess_135%	I just requested a permit from the main office.
%arbiter_confess_136%	It'll become effective as soon as my Arbiter's Notebook gets updated with a Moonstamp.
%arbiter_confess_138%	Arbitrage forms are updated in the Master Grimoire as soon as my pen touches the paper.
%arbiter_confess_139%	All of what I've written so far is already in the Office archives.
%arbiter_confess_141%	You girls sure are efficient, eh?
%arbiter_confess_142%	There are Witch covens all around the universe, we can't afford to be going back and forth to the Moon Temple all the time.
%arbiter_confess_143%	Makes sense.
%arbiter_confess_145%	And it's official!
%arbiter_confess_146%	You can now receive guests to your cute asteroid home!
%arbiter_confess_147%	Ah... this makes me happier than I can express.
%arbiter_confess_148%	Aaaw...
%arbiter_confess_149%	I can't let you rot here all alone.
%arbiter_confess_150%	Thank you so much.
%arbiter_confess_151%	No worries. I just had to. You don't deserve this.
%arbiter_confess_152%	Do you want me to let your coven know?
%arbiter_confess_153%	Mmm... Just let Jasmine and Dahlia know for now.
%arbiter_confess_154%	I'm not ready to go public yet. It's been two hundred years...
%arbiter_confess_156%	Poor thing... Isolation must have done a number on you.
%arbiter_confess_158%	Don't worry. I'll send a Falcon to each of them.
%arbiter_confess_159%	Thanks again.
%arbiter_confess_160%	Well, I'm so sorry, but I should be going now.
%arbiter_confess_161%	It's been a pleasure to meet you. And thank you very much for the reading.
%arbiter_confess_166%	Take care.
%arbiter_confess_167%	Please, let me know if you need anything. I'm here to help.
%arbiter_confess_168%	Bye!
%driving_1_2%	And I had a five minute long orgasm.
%driving_1_3%	No way. You're shitting me.
%driving_1_4%	How do you know it was five minutes? Were you counting?
%driving_1_5%	I swear! I don't know what he did to me.
%driving_1_6%	I pushed him away when I started coming.
%driving_1_7%	He rolled up a cigarette and smoked it while watching me squirm.
%driving_1_8%	When he put it away I was still fighting the last spasms over the carpet.
%driving_1_9%	I'm so jealous! I want to have a super-orgasm too!
%driving_1_10%	How did he do it?
%driving_1_11%	Well...
%driving_1_12%	He put this special toy in my butt...
%driving_1_13%	That played a major role, but I think it was the combination of many factors.
%driving_1_14%	The incense, the cocktails he prepared, the music, the smell of the sea.
%driving_1_15%	The planets just aligned, what can I say?
%driving_1_16%	So cool...
%driving_1_17%	Hearing about your sex adventures is so fun. You should write a book.
%driving_1_18%	I'd rather keep it between us.
%driving_1_19%	I don't want everybody to discover I'm a sex goddess.
%driving_1_20%	Imagine dealing with all those slimy middle-aged guys at the office.
%driving_1_21%	True, true...
%driving_1_22%	You should calm down with the sex goddess stuff a little or you'll end up finding trouble.
%driving_1_23%	More trouble, I mean.
%driving_1_24%	Oh, come on. It's only been a couple of scares.
%driving_1_25%	What's life for if not to enjoy ourselves?
%driving_1_26%	You need to find someone half as good as me to understand all the good sex you've been missing out on, sis.
%driving_1_27%	Ew.
%driving_1_28%	I've gotta say, I wouldn't mind experiencing for myself what a goddess can do...
%driving_1_29%	Hahahaha, what are you saying? You have Alicia.
%driving_1_30%	Actually...
%driving_2_2%	We broke up.
%driving_2_3%	Oh, girl... I'm sorry to hear that.
%driving_2_4%	I'm sorry, Eva. What happened?
%driving_2_5%	We've been dating since high school, and I guess we just... drifted apart.
%driving_2_6%	But you looked so good together the last time we had dinner at your apartment.
%driving_2_7%	Yeah, we've always been good at putting up a front.
%driving_2_8%	But the truth is that this last year we've been fighting too many times a week.
%driving_2_9%	What about?
%driving_2_10%	Oh, the stupidest details.
%driving_2_11%	I have my theory about what was pissing Alicia off, anyway.
%driving_2_12%	I tried to confront her about it but she wouldn't admit it because that would make her a bad person or something.
%driving_2_13%	It was because of all the activism, right?
%driving_2_14%	Wow, how did you know?
%driving_2_15%	Nah, I just said it because it pisses me off a bit too, to be honest.
%driving_2_16%	Patrice!
%driving_2_17%	I guess sometimes I can be a bit too... passionate?
%driving_2_18%	It's not that.
%driving_2_19%	Being around someone that fundamentally good can be frustrating.
%driving_2_20%	I mean... You're vegan, only consume local produce, wear repurposed clothes, volunteer at a soup kitchen...
%driving_2_21%	But that's not much of a sacrifice. It's just about working on your habits, really.
%driving_2_22%	Come on!
%driving_2_23%	Ok, I get it... but I never asked Alicia to do all those things.
%driving_2_24%	Like I said, it's not your fault, but I couldn't be happy eating Burger King and wearing leather boots next to you.
%driving_2_25%	Come on, I'm sure their relationship was more complicated than that.
%driving_2_26%	Nah... She's dead right.
%driving_2_27%	She just couldn't stand this goodie-two-shoes.
%driving_3_2%	Look! The sea!
%driving_3_3%	Ah... It smells so good...
%driving_3_4%	We're here, girls.
%driving_3_5%	Let's offer our souls to the ocean and cleanse all the shit we've picked up from the city.
%driving_3_6%	Can't wait to see the meteor shower!
%driving_3_7%	I'm gonna wish for the three of us to leave everything behind and come live here.
%driving_3_8%	I love you.
%driving_3_9%	Aw... Always so corny.
%driving_3_10%	Haha... We love you, too.
%driving_3_11%	...
%driving_3_12%	...
%driving_3_13%	...
%driving_3_14%	Fortuna, are you a virgin?
%driving_3_15%	What!? Why would you ask that?
%driving_3_16%	Hahahaha!
%driving_3_17%	You never talk about dating, and I've never known any boyfriends or girlfriends of yours.
%driving_3_18%	I've had sex, but I've never had a relationship.
%driving_3_19%	Don't try to look cool.
%driving_3_20%	My sister had sex once in high school and that's it.
%driving_3_21%	There's nothing wrong with that, I was just curious!
%driving_3_22%	...
%driving_3_23%	I don't know, I like sex... I think.
%driving_3_24%	But I rarely find anyone that piques my interest.
%driving_3_25%	Well, don't worry, you'll find someone special eventually.
%driving_3_26%	And if she doesn't find anyone that's alright, too.
%driving_3_27%	Relationships are overrated.
%driving_3_28%	Ah... maybe.
%driving_3_29%	Stay out of my business, you two.
%driving_3_30%	It's the next stop, I'm pulling over.
%prepare_dinner_2%	I'm going to start preparing dinner!
%prepare_dinner_3%	Do you feel like pizza?
%prepare_dinner_4%	YES!
%prepare_dinner_5%	My body is so ready for pizza.
%prepare_dinner_6%	Do it, sis.
%prepare_dinner_7%	Coming right up.
%pizza_2%	Mmm...
%pizza_3%	There's something magic about this dough.
%pizza_4%	Having a sister that owns a food truck sure is a perk.
%pizza_5%	Yeah, thanks for the pizza and for the ride, Fortuna.
%pizza_8%	So thoughtful of you to make one without cheese or meat.
%pizza_9%	I wouldn't call it pizza, though...
%pizza_10%	It's just some nice bread with tomato sauce.
%pizza_14%	And I could have done without the arugula... yuck.
%pizza_16%	Ah... Cheese is the thing I miss the most.
%pizza_17%	I hope one day someone will invent vegan cheese, or something close.
%pizza_18%	You should ask for it from the shooting star, haha.
%pizza_21%	And for forcing me to eat cheese.
%pizza_22%	Oh no! I'm so sorry!
%pizza_23%	It wasn't on purpose. I made the pizza on autopilot.
%pizza_24%	It's ok, I mean...
%pizza_25%	Cheese is the thing I miss the most from having gone vegan.
%pizza_26%	This is a beautiful accident.
%pizza_27%	But... try not to feed me cheese again, please.
%pizza_28%	Yes, yes, I'm sorry!
%pizza_29%	I cannot fathom a pizza without cheese.
%pizza_30%	I wouldn't even call it pizza.
%pizza_31%	I can make nice pizzas without cheese, too.
%pizza_32%	I bet I could make one even you would enjoy.
%pizza_33%	What do you mean, "even" me?
%pizza_34%	Someone with as high standards and as few manners as you.
%pizza_35%	Hey!
%pizza_36%	Hahahaha!
%pizza_37%	Hahaha.
%pizza_38%	You're kidding, right?
%pizza_39%	Yes, of course. Relax.
%pizza_40%	She knows how to piss you off, huh?
%pizza_41%	Yeah, what a talent.
%pizza_44%	Although I'll just have one slice...
%pizza_45%	Ah! The pepperoni!
%pizza_46%	Yeah, too much for me.
%pizza_47%	Why don't you just pick it off?
%pizza_48%	It already sweated all over the pizza.
%pizza_49%	I wouldn't mind making an exception, especially with cheese, but pepperoni is a step too far.
%pizza_50%	I'm so sorry, Eva. I'll go and make another one right now.
%pizza_51%	No, no! Don't worry.
%pizza_52%	I brought some fruit in case you made something I should skip.
%pizza_53%	I wouldn't want to impose.
%pizza_54%	No, really, it's no problem.
%pizza_55%	It's alright, seriously.
%pizza_56%	I'm just happy to be here. I'm so excited I'm not even hungry.
%pizza_57%	Ah, ok... I'm sorry.
%pizza_58%	On the other hand, I am starving and I love pepperoni.
%pizza_59%	So you made my day, Fortuna.
%pizza_60%	Great. Cosmic balance restored, haha.
%pizza_64%	I could have done without the arugula though... yuck.
%pizza_66%	...
%pizza_68%	By the way, how long until the meteor shower?
%pizza_69%	It could start any minute now.
%pizza_70%	We'll definitely be watching stars fall in less than an hour.
%pizza_71%	What are you girls gonna be asking for?
%pizza_72%	Huh... We're not supposed to tell, are we?
%pizza_73%	That's up to you.
%pizza_74%	But I believe the stars don't care about what you say out loud.
%pizza_75%	What are you going to wish for?
%pizza_76%	Many things. I have a list, haha.
%pizza_77%	But I guess that my most important wish is...
%pizza_78%	I...
%pizza_79%	I want to become a better person.
%pizza_80%	What do you mean? You're already a good person!
%pizza_81%	Don't bother sweet-talking me.
%pizza_82%	I can tell. I see it reflected in you, and in people at the office, and in every guy after they ejaculate.
%pizza_83%	I'm obnoxious.
%pizza_84%	You could work on your empathy a bit, yeah.
%pizza_85%	Fortuna!
%pizza_86%	It's ok, we promised we'd never bullshit each other. Right, little asshole?
%pizza_87%	I love you.
%pizza_88%	I love you, too.
%pizza_89%	Argh... I'll never get you two.
%pizza_90%	Hahaha. I guess we're a pair of mean sisters and that's all that there is to it.
%pizza_91%	What do you plan to wish for, Eva?
%pizza_92%	Mmm...
%pizza_93%	I want to save the world.
%pizza_94%	Come on! You can't really be that selfless!
%pizza_95%	No, really.
%pizza_96%	It makes me really anxious.
%pizza_97%	Even with everything I do...
%pizza_98%	No matter if I recycle, consume critically, go to rallies or donate part of my income to fight poverty...
%pizza_99%	The world always moves in the wrong direction.
%pizza_100%	We can't fight whoever's in the driver's seat.
%pizza_101%	I want the stars to help me not give up against impending doom.
%pizza_102%	I'm sorry...
%pizza_103%	Eva, would you like me to help you figure this stuff out with my cards?
%pizza_104%	Oh! Yes please!
%pizza_105%	I've been thinking about your Tarot deck all day, but I was too shy to ask... haha.
%pizza_106%	You know I enjoy reading your fortune.
%pizza_107%	Please, go ahead.
%meteor_shower_2%	If your prediction ever becomes real, my grandchildren will think I've lost it when I keep telling them how my friend predicted all this through Tarot, hahahaha.
%meteor_shower_3%	Hahaha...
%meteor_shower_4%	You're aware that you just totally screwed with Eva's head, right?
%meteor_shower_5%	I didn't mean to!
%meteor_shower_6%	Hahaha, come on, it hasn't been that bad.
%meteor_shower_7%	A future that distant just feels like fiction, prophecy or not.
%meteor_shower_8%	What about you?
%meteor_shower_9%	Now that you know the fate of the world, what are your plans?
%meteor_shower_16%	I don't see myself going to live inside a computer, to be honest.
%meteor_shower_17%	If most of humanity becomes data I'm sure there'll be plenty of space for the rest of us up here.
%meteor_shower_20%	I'd rather burn with the rest of the land than live forever with a roof over my head.
%meteor_shower_21%	Fuck the domes.
%meteor_shower_24%	I don't know.
%meteor_shower_25%	Maybe a superbacteria eating half of humankind away would end up being a good thing.
%meteor_shower_26%	I don't care, in any case.
%meteor_shower_29%	I feel sorry for the Earth, but I believe it would be beautiful for humanity to reach other planets.
%meteor_shower_30%	I love space. I would love to leave this planet.
%meteor_shower_31%	Oh, maybe you'll get to visit Mars!
%meteor_shower_32%	I don't think so...
%meteor_shower_33%	Fortuna foretold I'll have bone cancer in my fifties.
%meteor_shower_34%	So I doubt I'll ever get to reach the stars.
%meteor_shower_37%	I don't care who's on the throne, I plan to keep enjoying life to the fullest.
%meteor_shower_38%	I doubt I'll get to meet the superior entity that's supposed to come.
%meteor_shower_42%	Fortuna foretold I'll have bone cancer in my fifties, anyway.
%meteor_shower_43%	So I doubt I'll get to see any of that.
%meteor_shower_45%	That's horrible! Why did you tell your sister that, Fortuna?
%meteor_shower_46%	We were kids, and I dared her to read as far as she could into my future.
%meteor_shower_47%	I've never read to anyone's end ever again.
%meteor_shower_48%	I felt a terrifying presence lurking beyond my vision, like if I could keep on reading beyond death, then...
%meteor_shower_49%	Ah... now I'm scared.
%meteor_shower_50%	I will never forget that feeling.
%meteor_shower_51%	At that moment my fortune telling skills were... enhanced in some way.
%meteor_shower_52%	I've never been wrong since then.
%meteor_shower_53%	It's true. I can vouch for that.
%meteor_shower_54%	Don't tell me that, I don't want the world to go bananas...
%meteor_shower_55%	Maybe we can fight magic with magic.
%meteor_shower_56%	Look, the meteor shower has begun.
%meteor_shower_57%	Let's ask the shooting stars to fix the scary future.
%meteor_shower_2_2%	Since it's just the three of us on this beach, why don't we tell the stars what we want out loud?
%meteor_shower_2_3%	I already told you what I'm gonna wish for, so I'm ok!
%meteor_shower_2_4%	Ah... ok.
%meteor_shower_2_5%	I'll go first.
%meteor_shower_2_6%	Please, stars!
%meteor_shower_2_7%	Save the world from the fate Fortuna foretold!
%meteor_shower_2_8%	Give us a chance to make it right!
%meteor_shower_2_9%	You made my sister sound like a villain, hahaha.
%meteor_shower_2_10%	Aw, don't say that!
%meteor_shower_2_11%	Stars!
%meteor_shower_2_12%	Please, make my sister happy.
%meteor_shower_2_13%	Help her find whatever she's always been looking for!
%meteor_shower_2_14%	Hey... weren't you going to wish to become a better person?
%meteor_shower_2_15%	Nah, that wouldn't suit me.
%meteor_shower_2_16%	I'd rather use my wish to take care of my little sister.
%meteor_shower_2_17%	That means you're a good person, already, hehe.
%meteor_shower_2_18%	Oh, shut up, don't ruin my cool moment.
%meteor_shower_2_19%	...
%meteor_shower_2_20%	Come on, Fortuna. Ask them.
%meteor_shower_2_21%	Speak from your heart.
%meteor_shower_2_22%	I...
%meteor_shower_2_23%	It doesn't matter.
%meteor_shower_2_24%	Please, tell us.
%meteor_shower_2_25%	Where's your mind? What’s the thing you want that's so wild only the stars could give it to you?
%meteor_shower_2_26%	I want you to be happy.
%meteor_shower_2_27%	...
%meteor_shower_2_28%	I know there is something else.
%meteor_shower_2_29%	I smell it in the sea breeze.
%meteor_shower_2_30%	I keep seeing it in the dance of every flame.
%meteor_shower_2_31%	When I look at my cards, I can tell that magic is real.
%meteor_shower_2_32%	Yet everyone's always reminding me of how childish I am.
%meteor_shower_2_33%	I don't want to be a woman.
%meteor_shower_2_34%	I want to be a...
%spread_eva_intro_2%	Alright, what do you want to know?
%spread_eva_intro_3%	I want to know about the world's fate!
%spread_eva_intro_4%	That's very brave.
%spread_eva_intro_5%	Are you sure you want to ask the Tarot about this?
%spread_eva_intro_6%	Yes.
%spread_eva_intro_7%	Even if what we find is something terrible?
%spread_eva_intro_8%	Yes.
%spread_eva_intro_10%	Ok, we'll look into the fate of the world.
%spread_eva_intro_11%	Also, I'd like to know what I can do to make it a better place.
%spread_eva_intro_12%	Understood.
%spread_eva_intro_14%	Focus on those questions in your mind while I shuffle the cards.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_7%	Overpopulation will lead most of humanity to live inside computers.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_8%	What!?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_9%	What do you mean inside a computer?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_10%	They're barely big enough to fit a couple of people inside, right?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_11%	Computers in the future will be able to store places and persons as electronic data.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_12%	They'll be immortal as long as power keeps running through the machines.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_17%	Climate change will make human life unsustainable and we will take refuge in massive domed cities.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_18%	You're shitting me, right?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_19%	I'm afraid I'm not...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_20%	The temperature of the planet is going to rise uncontrollably.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_21%	By the end of the 21st century, almost every major capital of the world will have a giant protective dome.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_22%	The domes will be connected by an ultrafast transport system capable of circumnavigating the Earth in a few hours.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_27%	Superbacteria will decimate humanity, leading us to simpler times.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_28%	Ah, simpler times. That's great...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_29%	What are you saying!?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_30%	Eventually, many microorganisms will grow resistant to antibiotics and we won't be able to stop them.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_31%	Judgment day will come in the form of worldwide natural selection.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_32%	You can't be serious.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_33%	On the other hand, suddenly there will be plenty of resources for everyone.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_34%	Nature will reconquer large areas of the partially empty cities.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_39%	You'll get to witness the beginning of an era of space travel. In time, humanity will expand beyond the solar system.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_40%	Wow! Really?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_41%	That's amazing! But how can you tell?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_42%	You won't get to set foot on other planets, but your grandson will prosper on Mars.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_43%	Hahaha, you're just messing with me!
%spread_eva_worldsfate_44%	...Right?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_45%	On the other hand, the Earth will slowly die, overexploited in service of the conquest of space.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_46%	Many animal species will perish...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_47%	In time, Earth will be reduced to a planetary slum.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_52%	A non-human entity will rule over us and make us all happy.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_53%	Hahahaha.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_54%	It could come in the form of an alien being, or maybe some kind of artificial intelligence developed by humans... or even the manifestation of a new deity.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_55%	Wait, seriously?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_56%	It'll cause some conflict in the beginning, especially with people who don't want to relinquish their control.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_57%	But in less than a decade it'll become clear that we're better off being looked after by this superior intelligence.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_58%	Our society's welfare will peak.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_63%	Stop, stop. Just... stop.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_64%	You're messing with me, right?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_65%	I swear to you, this is what the cards are telling me.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_66%	You're usually more vague, like "there will be an opportunity to develop yourself," or "You will soon face a challenge."
%spread_eva_worldsfate_67%	Now you're like, channeling visions from another dimension or something.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_68%	Yeah, I'm surprised too...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_69%	Maybe it's the energy of the meteor shower, or some planets we don't know about just aligned over my deck.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_70%	But I see it as clear as I can see your face.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_71%	This is the fate of the world.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_73%	How can you say these things with a straight face!?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_74%	Ah...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_75%	I can't decide whether to cry or to laugh...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_76%	Do you still want to know what you can do about all this?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_77%	Yeah, sure, why not. Let's hear the whole joke.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_84%	Gah... my actions will never make any difference.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_85%	What could I possibly do against that science fiction movie the stars projected into your head?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_95%	I wonder what kind of revolutionary group I could build if we're all going to become computer data anyway.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_96%	Will being vegan matter in an electric simulation?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_97%	Or maybe I'll fight to avoid humanity migrating inside computers?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_98%	Ah... Why did you put these weird ideas in my head?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_99%	I'm sorry...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_102%	What kind of revolution am I supposed to lead to stop humanity from going into domes?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_103%	Ah... you won't be able to stop this.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_104%	But maybe you'll slow the catastrophe enough for future generations to be able to complete the dome solution in time?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_105%	Yay...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_108%	And as for my actions... What could a revolution do against a superbacteria epidemic, anyway?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_109%	A militia to lead and protect the survivors?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_110%	Ugh, no. I would hate that.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_113%	And my actions are supposed to be "aggressive and illegal" in this setting?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_114%	Wait. How cool would it be to become the founder of a space pirate fleet, huh?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_115%	But... I foretold you won't get to leave this planet.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_116%	Shh, shh... let me have something to dream about, at least.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_119%	And you said my actions are going to be "aggressive and illegal"...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_120%	What am I going to do against a superior entity, though?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_121%	I'll be one of the few to keep our ruler in check?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_122%	Or you could be one of their enforcers, hunting down the old regime.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_123%	Pfft... Hahahaha.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_124%	What's up?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_125%	I'm sorry. You don't expect me to buy any of this, right?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_126%	I know it's a bit far-fetched...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_127%	It is.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_137%	And what's my guerrilla propaganda movement supposed to do in this scenario?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_138%	We're going to write computer programs to warn the people inside the computers about a world they don't care about?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_139%	Ah... I don't know.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_142%	I hope my guerrilla propaganda movement at least keeps us from ruining the domes.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_143%	What a dire prospect...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_146%	And what's my guerrilla propaganda movement supposed to do in this scenario?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_147%	How can information stop a superbacteria?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_148%	It can't.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_149%	But maybe the group you've built will come in handy to guide the survivors in the new world?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_150%	I'd like whatever movement I start to keep on helping no matter the context, yeah...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_153%	So my guerrilla propaganda whatever will be heard around the universe, huh?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_154%	Hopefully it'll help to keep humans from fucking up more planets.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_157%	I hope this superior being approves of my guerrilla propaganda network, whatever that means.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_158%	The future you're drawing is too surreal, Fortuna.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_168%	I wonder if my foundation will work for the people inside the computers or for the ones who remain outside... mmm...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_169%	I still find that prediction surreal, to be honest.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_172%	Well, it's good you foretold I'm going to start a foundation to look after everyone.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_173%	If humanity ends up trapped inside domes, it's going to need more solidarity than ever to survive.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_176%	My super beautiful foundation will be for nothing, then.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_177%	We're all doomed by the superbacteria.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_178%	Don't say that.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_179%	Isn’t it worth it to make people happier for fifty years?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_180%	Ah... You're right. Even if it just means making someone's life better for a day it's all worth it.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_181%	Thank you.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_182%	Don't give up.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_185%	So, about the foundation I'm supposed to create... What's its role?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_186%	Will we stay to pick up the pieces of what they leave behind here on Earth?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_187%	Cards didn't say.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_188%	It'll create good for many people, here or on Mars, that's for sure.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_189%	That's good to know...
%spread_eva_worldsfate_192%	And what about the foundation you told me I'd start?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_193%	Is my role to take care of the less fortunate until our savior from another world comes to visit?
%spread_eva_worldsfate_194%	You don't believe me, huh... I don't blame you.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_195%	It's incredibly hard to swallow.
%spread_eva_worldsfate_196%	Although... I can also tell you're not joking.
%spread_eva_youractions_7%	Your most effective course of action will be to resort to illegal and aggressive methods.
%spread_eva_youractions_8%	Oh no!
%spread_eva_youractions_9%	That's if you want to make a dent on this world's fate.
%spread_eva_youractions_10%	Otherwise you’ll be left making ridiculous changes to what you eat and how you live just to minimize the damage done by others.
%spread_eva_youractions_11%	Is this the cards speaking, or are you just lecturing me?
%spread_eva_youractions_12%	The cards, I swear!
%spread_eva_youractions_13%	I'm investigating what elements could frustrate you enough to set you on the radical path.
%spread_eva_youractions_14%	In fact, I can see your legacy: a revolutionary movement that will last centuries.
%spread_eva_youractions_15%	But that's terrible!
%spread_eva_youractions_16%	If I ever start a group I swear to you I'm going to call it "Forgive Us" or something like that, in case it gets out of control.
%spread_eva_youractions_22%	In any case, what kind of world are we going to live in that'll push me into becoming a revolutionary?
%spread_eva_youractions_23%	Let's take a look.
%spread_eva_youractions_26%	I wonder what kind of group it'll be if we're all going to become computer data anyway.
%spread_eva_youractions_27%	Would being vegan matter in an electronic simulation?
%spread_eva_youractions_28%	Or maybe I'll fight to avoid humanity migrating inside computers?
%spread_eva_youractions_29%	Ah... Why did you put these weird ideas in my head?
%spread_eva_youractions_30%	I'm sorry...
%spread_eva_youractions_33%	I won't be successful either way if humanity is forced to go live inside domes due to climate change.
%spread_eva_youractions_34%	Maybe you'll slow the catastrophe enough for future generations to be able to complete the dome solution in time?
%spread_eva_youractions_35%	Yay...
%spread_eva_youractions_38%	What could a revolution do against a superbacteria epidemic, anyway.
%spread_eva_youractions_39%	A militia to lead and protect the survivors?
%spread_eva_youractions_40%	Ugh, no. I would hate that.
%spread_eva_youractions_41%	Sorry.
%spread_eva_youractions_44%	Although, it would be cool to be the founder of a space pirate fleet, huh?
%spread_eva_youractions_45%	But I foretold you won't get to leave this planet.
%spread_eva_youractions_46%	Shh, shh... let me have something to dream about, at least.
%spread_eva_youractions_49%	What are we going to do against a superior entity, though?
%spread_eva_youractions_50%	I'll be one of the few to keep our ruler in check?
%spread_eva_youractions_51%	Or you could be their enforcers, hunting down the old regime.
%spread_eva_youractions_52%	Pfft... Hahahaha.
%spread_eva_youractions_53%	What's up?
%spread_eva_youractions_54%	I'm sorry. You don't expect me to buy any of this, right?
%spread_eva_youractions_55%	I know it's a bit far-fetched...
%spread_eva_youractions_56%	It is.
%spread_eva_youractions_61%	You'll set up a guerrilla propaganda group that becomes famous world-wide.
%spread_eva_youractions_62%	Wow. What's that?
%spread_eva_youractions_63%	I sense that in the future there will be many more channels for communication beyond newspapers, radio, and TV.
%spread_eva_youractions_64%	Free from the control of media outlets.
%spread_eva_youractions_65%	And you'll be at the head of a notorious group whose message spreads throughout many countries.
%spread_eva_youractions_66%	Mmm... It doesn't sound bad!
%spread_eva_youractions_67%	I've always wanted to be able to encourage as many people as possible!
%spread_eva_youractions_68%	And handing out flyers at the university hasn't been super effective up to this point...
%spread_eva_youractions_69%	Well, congrats. You're going to get your megaphone.
%spread_eva_youractions_71%	Now tell me about the world. Let's see how I could use this megaphone.
%spread_eva_youractions_74%	Great. I'll use it to let everyone know how screwed we are.
%spread_eva_youractions_79%	Incapable of fighting corporations and governments, you'll start a foundation to support the damned.
%spread_eva_youractions_80%	Aaaw! That's beautiful!
%spread_eva_youractions_81%	And sad...
%spread_eva_youractions_82%	But also beautiful.
%spread_eva_youractions_83%	You will create homes. You will feed the hungry. Your foundation will give many people a second chance.
%spread_eva_youractions_84%	Ah... you're going to make me cry.
%spread_eva_youractions_90%	Ok, now tell me what kind of world I'm gonna be healing.
%spread_eva_youractions_93%	I wonder if my foundation will work for the people inside the computers or for the ones who remain outside... mmm...
%spread_eva_youractions_94%	I still find that prediction surreal, to be honest.
%spread_eva_youractions_97%	If humanity ends up trapped inside domes, it's going to need more solidarity than ever to survive.
%spread_eva_youractions_100%	It'll all be for nothing, though. We are all doomed by that superbacteria thing.
%spread_eva_youractions_101%	Don't say that.
%spread_eva_youractions_102%	Isn't it worth it to make people happier for fifty years?
%spread_eva_youractions_103%	You're right. Even if it just means making someone's life better for a day, it's all worth it.
%spread_eva_youractions_104%	Thank you.
%spread_eva_youractions_105%	Don't give up.
%spread_eva_youractions_108%	My foundation will stay to pick up the pieces they leave behind here on Earth, then?
%spread_eva_youractions_109%	Cards didn't say.
%spread_eva_youractions_110%	It'll create good for many people, here or on Mars, that's for sure.
%spread_eva_youractions_111%	That's good to know...
%spread_eva_youractions_114%	Looks like I'll be taking care of the less fortunate until our savior from another world comes to visit, huh?
%spread_eva_youractions_115%	You don't believe me, huh... I don't blame you.
%spread_eva_youractions_116%	It's incredibly hard to swallow.
%spread_eva_youractions_117%	But I can also tell you're not joking.
%spread_eva_youractions_122%	Nothing you do will matter. Better give up and have fun.
%spread_eva_youractions_124%	Not you too, Tarot.
%spread_eva_youractions_125%	That's what Alicia always told me.
%spread_eva_youractions_126%	I refuse to stop caring, no matter what.
%spread_eva_youractions_127%	The only thing that matters is to find something worth fighting for, and then fighting.
%spread_eva_youractions_128%	Victory is up to the stars.
%spread_eva_youractions_129%	The stars say it won't work...
%spread_eva_youractions_130%	I'd be too miserable if I gave up.
%spread_eva_youractions_131%	I'm sorry...
%spread_eva_youractions_132%	Actually, you've helped.
%spread_eva_youractions_133%	After being presented with the prospect of absolute nihilism my heart still urged me to fight.
%spread_eva_youractions_134%	So now I'm way less anxious about all this.
%spread_eva_youractions_135%	I'm glad.
%spread_eva_youractions_136%	Now, tell me about the world.
%spread_eva_youractions_139%	No shit.
%spread_eva_youractions_141%	What could I possibly do against that science fiction movie the stars projected into your head?
%spread_eva_youractions_143%	Pass me that pepperoni pizza!
%spread_eva_youractions_144%	Carpe diem.
%spread_eva_followup_2%	I didn't expect the cards to be this wild and specific... I'm so sorry.
%spread_eva_followup_3%	Nah, it's alright.
%spread_eva_followup_4%	It's been scary, but also fun.
	
%abramar_intro_c3_2%	That wasn't so bad, right?
%abramar_intro_c3_3%	That arbiter, Théa, seems nice.
%abramar_intro_c3_4%	Yeah, I feel like she genuinely wants to help.
%abramar_intro_c3_5%	It's not a vibe you often get from magical authorities.
%abramar_intro_c3_8%	So bold of you to go and confess you're crafting a new divination deck.
%abramar_intro_c3_11%	I didn't feel intimidated by Théa.
%abramar_intro_c3_12%	I've felt powerful since I met you.
%abramar_intro_c3_13%	This deck isn't going to be a secret for long.
%abramar_intro_c3_17%	I didn't feel intimidated by Théa.
%abramar_intro_c3_18%	We could use her help.
%abramar_intro_c3_20%	Mmm... I see.
%abramar_intro_c3_21%	Ok, you know your coven better than me.
%abramar_intro_c3_25%	I've felt powerful since I met you.
%abramar_intro_c3_26%	I'm not scared of the Arbiters.
%abramar_intro_c3_28%	It's too soon for me to be cast away again, Fortuna.
%abramar_intro_c3_29%	I'm not saying you should be fearful, but please, do exercise some caution.
%abramar_intro_c3_30%	Don't worry, I got this.
%abramar_intro_c3_34%	This deck isn't going to be a secret for long.
%abramar_intro_c3_35%	Better to count on the sympathy of the Arbiters early.
%abramar_intro_c3_37%	Oh, good point.
%abramar_intro_c3_38%	Happy to know I'm in safe hands.
%abramar_intro_c3_42%	You didn't dare tell her you're crafting a new divination deck, eh...
%abramar_intro_c3_43%	Of course not.
%abramar_intro_c3_44%	My divination is why I was sent to exile.
%abramar_intro_c3_45%	Yes, yes, I know.
%abramar_intro_c3_46%	It sounds like the logical thing to do.
%abramar_intro_c3_47%	But it could have been a great opportunity to do a reading for Théa and mess with her a bit, don't you think?
%abramar_intro_c3_48%	Mmm... maybe?
%abramar_intro_c3_49%	I wouldn't call reading someone's fate 'messing' with them.
%abramar_intro_c3_50%	Oh, having had you read into my soul twice now, let me tell you: it feels messy.
%abramar_intro_c3_52%	Should we do that reading we had pending now?
%abramar_intro_c3_53%	Er... mmm... it can wait.
%abramar_intro_c3_54%	You have mail waiting to be read, anyway.
%abramar_intro_c3_56%	What's the matter, are you scared?
%abramar_intro_c3_58%	Scared? Who? Me!?
%abramar_intro_c3_60%	HAHAHAHAHA.
%abramar_intro_c3_62%	Yes, I am.
%abramar_intro_c3_63%	What? Why?
%abramar_intro_c3_64%	I've had other beings read me the cards, the stones, the bones, the pendulum... you name it.
%abramar_intro_c3_65%	But what you do doesn't feel like fortune telling.
%abramar_intro_c3_67%	It feels like you're tearing the Cosmic Wheel apart.
%abramar_intro_c3_68%	Your readings are too deep and too sharp.
%abramar_intro_c3_69%	But... that level of insight is something desirable in a seer, isn't it?
%abramar_intro_c3_70%	Absolutely. You're the best I've ever seen in my long existence.
%abramar_intro_c3_71%	But exposing oneself to your arts feels so... taxing.
%abramar_intro_c3_73%	I'm happy, though.
%abramar_intro_c3_75%	It's been ages since someone stirred fear or unrest in me.
%abramar_intro_c3_76%	Thank you.
%abramar_intro_c3_77%	Happy to bother you, I guess.
%abramar_intro_c3_78%	But don't think you'll be able to postpone this reading indefinitely.
%abramar_intro_c3_80%	Hahahaha... sure, sure.
%abramar_intro_c3_82%	Don't let me keep you, now.
%abramar_intro_c3_83%	It seems like you have friends eager to meet you again.
%jasmine_entrance_2%	I'm so happy to see you, Fortuna!
%jasmine_entrance_3%	Thank you. Thank you for coming...
%jasmine_entrance_4%	I missed you so much...
%jasmine_entrance_5%	I love you.
%jasmine_entrance_6%	I love you, too.
%jasmine_catchup_2%	I thought you still had a sentence of eight centuries ahead of you.
%jasmine_catchup_3%	How in the cosmos did you manage to soften Aedana?
%jasmine_catchup_4%	I didn't. It was an Arbiter who took pity on me.
%jasmine_catchup_9%	Or, well, more than pitied me. I think she was awestruck or something.
%jasmine_catchup_12%	Or, well, more than pitied me. She was afraid of me and helped me just to get on my good side?
%jasmine_catchup_14%	Either way, she lifted the ban on visitation since she determined Aedana's punishment was too severe.
%jasmine_catchup_15%	And that Arbiter was dang right.
%jasmine_catchup_17%	I mean, I wouldn't dare to go against Aedana's judgment...
%jasmine_catchup_19%	But keeping you from receiving guests is a punishment for all the coven, not just you!
%jasmine_catchup_21%	You're just too precious.
%jasmine_catchup_23%	I missed you so much.
%jasmine_catchup_24%	I missed you too.
%jasmine_catchup_25%	So, tell me, what did I miss in these two centuries?
%jasmine_catchup_26%	Shut up! You tell me about you!
%jasmine_catchup_27%	Ah... I'm not ready to go into that.
%jasmine_catchup_28%	It's nothing pretty. Isolation can take you down some dark paths.
%jasmine_catchup_29%	I'd rather hear about the outside world. It would mend my spirit a bit.
%jasmine_catchup_31%	Ah... ok, ok.
%jasmine_catchup_33%	What would you like to know about?
%jasmine_catchup_37%	Anyway...
%jasmine_catchup_40%	How's the coven these days?
%jasmine_catchup_41%	Are you working on anything interesting?
%jasmine_catchup_42%	Any juicy gossip?
%jasmine_catchup_43%	Listen, I'm crafting a new divination deck.
%jasmine_catchup_47%	How's the coven these days?
%jasmine_catchup_50%	Powerful, I'd say.
%jasmine_catchup_51%	We're growing beyond the scale of any other covens.
%jasmine_catchup_52%	Both in knowledge and in power.
%jasmine_catchup_54%	Although it's becoming more and more demanding to keep up with Aedana's direction.
%jasmine_catchup_56%	She's set up a system where we all have quarterly performance checks.
%jasmine_catchup_58%	And that's made us all grow exponentially!
%jasmine_catchup_59%	Many other covens are trying to imitate our system to stay competitive.
%jasmine_catchup_61%	But some Witches are having problems staying in the game...
%jasmine_catchup_62%	And if you accumulate too many low performance reviews, you get expelled from the coven.
%jasmine_catchup_65%	I'm doing fine, though. Don't worry about me.
%jasmine_catchup_68%	You've always been so talented.
%jasmine_catchup_69%	Fuck Aedana.
%jasmine_catchup_73%	You've always been so talented.
%jasmine_catchup_74%	I'm sure you won't have any problem keeping up with the elite.
%jasmine_catchup_75%	I guess...
%jasmine_catchup_77%	Although I feel bad for all the sisters left behind...
%jasmine_catchup_78%	Yeah, that sucks.
%jasmine_catchup_80%	We should trust in Aedana's direction, though.
%jasmine_catchup_81%	She's the oldest, and I'm sure there's an important plan for all this.
%jasmine_catchup_82%	And it's not like the expelled Witches become pariahs.
%jasmine_catchup_84%	Witches from our coven are extremely well regarded everywhere and don't have any trouble finding a nice new position.
%jasmine_catchup_85%	That's a good consolation, I guess...
%jasmine_catchup_89%	Fuck Aedana.
%jasmine_catchup_91%	Fortuna!
%jasmine_catchup_92%	You can't keep saying these things if you plan on rejoining our coven!
%jasmine_catchup_93%	Or joining any other coven, for what it's worth.
%jasmine_catchup_94%	You should respect your elders.
%jasmine_catchup_97%	You're right, I'm sorry.
%jasmine_catchup_98%	It's hard to not hate Aedana at this point.
%jasmine_catchup_102%	You're right, I'm sorry.
%jasmine_catchup_104%	Ah... I'm sorry too...
%jasmine_catchup_105%	I know I will never understand the pain you're going through.
%jasmine_catchup_106%	But, please, endure. It would be too painful to lose you.
%jasmine_catchup_108%	Now that we can visit you I promise I'll do everything in my power to make your life better.
%jasmine_catchup_109%	Thank you.
%jasmine_catchup_113%	It's hard to not hate Aedana at this point.
%jasmine_catchup_114%	This absurd punishment will scar me for the rest of my existence.
%jasmine_catchup_116%	I'm sorry, Fortuna.
%jasmine_catchup_117%	I'm being too insensitive...
%jasmine_catchup_118%	I can't even begin to imagine how you're feeling right now.
%jasmine_catchup_119%	Do you want to talk about it?
%jasmine_catchup_120%	No.
%jasmine_catchup_121%	I'm gonna need some time.
%jasmine_catchup_122%	I'd rather focus on getting back in touch with reality.
%jasmine_catchup_124%	Whatever you need, Fortuna.
%jasmine_catchup_130%	Are you working on anything interesting?
%jasmine_catchup_131%	I am, indeed.
%jasmine_catchup_133%	I am perfecting the Art of Enchanted Chanoyu.
%jasmine_catchup_134%	Also known as Magical Teacraft.
%jasmine_catchup_135%	Haha, you've always loved your plants.
%jasmine_catchup_136%	How did you end up focusing on making tea?
%jasmine_catchup_138%	Well, I spent centuries becoming intimate with all kinds of flora.
%jasmine_catchup_139%	And even if my books on the matter helped many Witches around the universe, I wanted to start contributing to the community with something more practical.
%jasmine_catchup_140%	I've developed numerous dried mixtures, all harvested from my own personal garden.
%jasmine_catchup_142%	The flowers I grow are nurtured by a delicate balance of light, music, poems... and tons of manure.
%jasmine_catchup_143%	Hahahaha.
%jasmine_catchup_145%	Hahahaha.
%jasmine_catchup_147%	Basically, now I deal in magical herbs.
%jasmine_catchup_148%	You can brew creativity enhancers, mind openers, astral projectors, summoning channelers...
%jasmine_catchup_150%	I'm quite popular inside and outside the coven now, hehehe...
%jasmine_catchup_151%	You feel more confident than the Jasmine I used to know, yeah.
%jasmine_catchup_152%	I'm happy for you.
%jasmine_catchup_153%	I'll bring you some tea next time we meet!
%jasmine_catchup_155%	Thank you.
%jasmine_catchup_161%	Any juicy gossip?
%jasmine_catchup_162%	Whoa, I thought you didn't enjoy gossip.
%jasmine_catchup_163%	I didn't, but I know you do... and I've been incredibly bored.
%jasmine_catchup_164%	So I'm considering getting into the tittle-tattle club.
%jasmine_catchup_166%	Hahaha, that's wonderful.
%jasmine_catchup_168%	Any "genre" you may be interested in?
%jasmine_catchup_171%	What about some romance?
%jasmine_catchup_172%	Any major beef that I missed out on?
%jasmine_catchup_173%	Anything on Dahlia?
%jasmine_catchup_177%	What about some romance?
%jasmine_catchup_178%	Romance, huh...
%jasmine_catchup_179%	There's always plenty of that going on.
%jasmine_catchup_180%	But I guess the biggest highlight from this century is from your mentor!
%jasmine_catchup_181%	Yu-ënia!?
%jasmine_catchup_182%	Impossible, that hag doesn't have the ability to love.
%jasmine_catchup_183%	Maybe losing you made her realize that you have to love more openly and intensely.
%jasmine_catchup_184%	What then, she has a lover now?
%jasmine_catchup_186%	Hehehehe...
%jasmine_catchup_188%	She has a dozen!
%jasmine_catchup_189%	What!?
%jasmine_catchup_191%	Twelve lovers, among Witches, Fairies and Deer Folk.
%jasmine_catchup_192%	Shut up.
%jasmine_catchup_194%	Hahahahaha.
%jasmine_catchup_196%	I swear. She's changed a lot. She looks very happy now.
%jasmine_catchup_198%	Although... she hasn't accepted any new students after losing you.
%jasmine_catchup_199%	Hey, stop saying she lost me, I'm still alive.
%jasmine_catchup_201%	Ah, of course, I'm sorry. Do you want me to tell her she can visit?
%jasmine_catchup_202%	Uh... I'm not sure.
%jasmine_catchup_203%	I don't need the kind of lecture she'll have pent up over 200 years right now.
%jasmine_catchup_204%	Come on, I'm sure she'll be very happy to be reunited with you.
%jasmine_catchup_205%	Ok, soon, I promise. But not yet.
%jasmine_catchup_206%	Understood.
%jasmine_catchup_210%	Any major beef that I missed out on?
%jasmine_catchup_212%	Uh...
%jasmine_catchup_213%	Too much, I'd say.
%jasmine_catchup_214%	How so?
%jasmine_catchup_216%	Well, Aedana's new system is making us more competitive.
%jasmine_catchup_217%	Some of us in an unhealthy way...
%jasmine_catchup_221%	Aedana's set up a system where we all have quarterly performance checks.
%jasmine_catchup_223%	And that's made us all grow exponentially!
%jasmine_catchup_224%	Many other covens are trying to imitate our system to stay competitive.
%jasmine_catchup_226%	But some Witches are having problems staying in the game...
%jasmine_catchup_227%	And if you accumulate too many low performance reviews, you get expelled from the coven.
%jasmine_catchup_229%	The leader is the one who judges whether or not your performance is satisfactory, so...
%jasmine_catchup_230%	Some Witches succumbed to the temptation of sabotaging others' efforts to make their own progress seem better in the eyes of Aedana.
%jasmine_catchup_231%	Come on, Aedana is smart enough to see through those schemes.
%jasmine_catchup_232%	I don't know, there's a lot of Witches to keep an eye on...
%jasmine_catchup_233%	Don't let her fool you.
%jasmine_catchup_234%	I'm sure this all plays into Aedana's plans.
%jasmine_catchup_235%	To make you all tougher or whatever shitty power dynamic she's high on right now.
%jasmine_catchup_237%	That can't...
%jasmine_catchup_238%	...
%jasmine_catchup_239%	Do you support her system?
%jasmine_catchup_241%	Well... publicly, of course.
%jasmine_catchup_242%	Don't let this out of this room:
%jasmine_catchup_244%	I have my reservations, yes.
%jasmine_catchup_245%	I believe the system could be tweaked to keep personal happiness in mind a bit more.
%jasmine_catchup_246%	I don't know what Aedana's end game is but... this is turning out to be too much.
%jasmine_catchup_249%	I hope it all gets better eventually.
%jasmine_catchup_250%	Let's take that bitch down.
%jasmine_catchup_254%	I hope it all gets better eventually.
%jasmine_catchup_256%	Yes, me too...
%jasmine_catchup_258%	Sigh...
%jasmine_catchup_262%	Let's take that bitch down.
%jasmine_catchup_264%	Fortuna!
%jasmine_catchup_266%	Enough with the dangerous talk.
%jasmine_catchup_267%	You wouldn't want to lose your visitation permits, right?
%jasmine_catchup_268%	Ok, ok...
%jasmine_catchup_269%	But someone should do something about all this...
%jasmine_catchup_271%	We'll work something out.
%jasmine_catchup_273%	Aedana isn't evil, she's just... severe.
%jasmine_catchup_277%	Anything on Dahlia?
%jasmine_catchup_278%	Whoa, we're all best friends, you should ask her directly.
%jasmine_catchup_280%	I will! I'm inviting her over next.
%jasmine_catchup_283%	I did! She came by earlier, in fact.
%jasmine_catchup_285%	But, you know, even though she's so extroverted she doesn't reveal much.
%jasmine_catchup_286%	So I was hoping you could tell me if she's doing alright.
%jasmine_catchup_287%	Ah... ok, ok.
%jasmine_catchup_288%	Dahlia's fine. I'd say she's fine.
%jasmine_catchup_289%	She's a hard one to read, you're right.
%jasmine_catchup_291%	Hahahahaha.
%jasmine_catchup_294%	Lately, she's been a little obsessed with a Daemon she's trying to hunt.
%jasmine_catchup_295%	She told me she saw the Daemon in her dreams, and that it had the face of her long-lost mortal mother.
%jasmine_catchup_296%	I'm not even sure if the Daemon is real, since no one's ever seen it besides Dahlia in her dreams.
%jasmine_catchup_297%	Maybe you could help her find it through your divination?
%jasmine_catchup_298%	Mmm... I'd love to.
%jasmine_catchup_299%	I hope she doesn't get mad at us because you told me about it.
%jasmine_catchup_300%	She will.
%jasmine_catchup_301%	But Dahlia's incapable of being angry for more than a couple of minutes.
%jasmine_catchup_302%	You'll be fine.
%jasmine_catchup_304%	Hahahaha.
%jasmine_catchup_306%	It feels so good to talk to you again!
%jasmine_catchup_307%	You can't even begin to imagine.
%jasmine_catchup_312%	Listen, I'm crafting a new divination deck.
%jasmine_catchup_314%	Oh! Wow!
%jasmine_catchup_316%	Is it safe?
%jasmine_catchup_317%	It is unlike anything we've ever seen before.
%jasmine_catchup_318%	It's not Tarot per se. Every card has been hand-crafted by me.
%jasmine_catchup_319%	And from what I can tell so far, it can pierce deeper and more clearly than any kind of Oracle cards.
%jasmine_catchup_321%	Ohhh... sounds exciting.
%jasmine_catchup_322%	Don't let Aedana know, though.
%jasmine_catchup_324%	Of course, of course, I understand.
%jasmine_catchup_325%	I know you don't like breaking the rules, but I don't believe I'm breaking them.
%jasmine_catchup_326%	She banned my Tarot deck, but this is something totally new.
%jasmine_catchup_327%	Maybe this is what she meant to happen?
%jasmine_catchup_328%	I... I don't know, Fortuna.
%jasmine_catchup_329%	But you're exiled, in any case.
%jasmine_catchup_330%	What harm could you do from so far away?
%jasmine_catchup_332%	I won't tell Aedana.
%jasmine_catchup_333%	Thanks.
%jasmine_catchup_334%	So...
%jasmine_catchup_335%	Do you want me to read your fortune?
%jasmine_catchup_337%	Yes!
%jasmine_catchup_338%	Aaah! It's been so long since the last time you read for me.
%jasmine_catchup_339%	What was the last thing I asked you?
%jasmine_catchup_340%	Mmm...
%jasmine_catchup_341%	How to make an Arbiter fall in love with you.
%jasmine_catchup_343%	Oh, shut up!
%jasmine_catchup_345%	Oh my gods, you're right.
%jasmine_catchup_347%	I totally forgot about that girl, what a memory you have.
%jasmine_catchup_348%	I wonder what she's doing right now.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_2%	We can look into it with my cards if you want.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_3%	Naaah... That's in the past now.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_4%	I have more pressing concerns.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_5%	What's it gonna be, then?
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_6%	My magical garden isn't doing so well lately.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_7%	It feels ill.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_8%	And I can't figure out what the problem is.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_9%	So... My question is:
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_11%	What's wrong with my garden?
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_12%	I see... Anything else?
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_13%	Since we're on the topic.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_14%	I want to know the fate of my flowers.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_15%	Will they survive this illness? Will they become famous across the cosmos?
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_16%	What's in store for my project?
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_18%	Understood.
%spread_jasmine_first_intro_19%	Focus on the smell of your garden while I shuffle my cards.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_6%	There's nothing wrong with your garden. You're just tired. You need to rest.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_8%	Ah... but I shouldn't. I have so many orders to take care of!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_9%	I'm just the messenger.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_10%	Now you know the reason behind the soil's lack of health.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_11%	If you want your garden, and your Teacraft, to recover their glory, you should enjoy a nice vacation.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_12%	Uh... right.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_13%	Come on, it'll be good for everybody.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_14%	You didn't become a Witch to work yourself like a mule.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_16%	You're right.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_17%	I'll take it easy for a while.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_20%	Thank you.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_23%	I'm not about to break my back just for some nasty Witches to snatch away the fruits in the end.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_26%	I have to behave responsibly now that I know I'm going to be a mother, hehe.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_27%	You're gonna be great, don't sweat it.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_32%	Your garden craves your tears. You've been feeding it nothing but nice emotions. Now it's matured and it needs Truth to keep growing.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_33%	Oh... wow.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_34%	That is some deep insight, Fortuna.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_35%	I would never have thought of that.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_37%	Now I can't wait to go back to work on my garden! You're a genius!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_38%	Haha, glad to be of service.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_44%	Someone has hidden a corpse in your garden while you were away. It's the body of someone who was betrayed, and that's poisoning the soil.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_46%	What!? Why in the cosmos?
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_48%	There are near-infinite light years of space to dispose of a body!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_49%	Why would anyone bury a corpse in my garden!?
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_50%	Maybe it was meaningful for the one who buried it... or the victim.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_51%	I'm going to get to the bottom of this...
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_52%	This is so rude.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_53%	Hahaha, "rude." You're so cute.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_55%	Hey, leave me be!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_56%	Hahaha.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_61%	Your pride is poisoning the soil. Success has made you arrogant and your garden is suffering for it.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_63%	Fortuna! How can you say those things to me!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_64%	I'm not the one who...
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_66%	I know, I know, it's a message from the stars.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_67%	I'll never get used to you spurting the heavy stuff out of the blue.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_68%	Sorry.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_69%	Ah... I guess you're right, as you always are.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_70%	Time for me to do some soul searching, huh...
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_71%	Flowers are really sensitive to a Witch's ego, so this makes all the sense in the cosmos.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_72%	Thank you, this will put me on the right path for sure.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_77%	Aedana cursed your garden. She is testing you in secret to make you stronger.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_79%	No way!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_80%	So that was it!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_81%	I knew something smelled fishy lately.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_82%	I'm not even going to bother saying anything against her.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_83%	Ah...
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_84%	Whatever, I'll play along.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_86%	I'm just happy to know it wasn't my fault.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_87%	I'm going to prove to her how good of a gardener I can be.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_89%	Good luck.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_92%	And now that I know that I'm going to be a mother...
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_94%	I'm not about to let any haughty hag put a curse on my child.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_95%	Hahaha, I love this aggressive mom-to-be Jasmine already.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_97%	You watch me, hahaha.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_103%	A jealous Witch is sabotaging you. Someone who visited your garden recently planted some corrupted seeds.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_105%	Oh, no!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_106%	That's like... the worst possible cause.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_107%	I don't want anybody to hate me!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_108%	Can't you think who it could have been?
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_109%	I don't want to!
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_110%	I'll become too paranoid. I don't want to start suspecting my colleagues.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_111%	I'll just focus on healing my garden now that I know it's because of some corrupted seeds...
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_112%	...And I'll stay more vigilant with my guests... I guess.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_113%	This sucks.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_114%	I'm sorry, Jasmine.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_115%	It's not your fault.
%spread_jasmine_first_theillness_117%	You've been really helpful, thank you.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_6%	Your garden will grow beyond your wildest expectations. You will accept disciples and take care of an immense flower dominion.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_8%	Woohoooo!!!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_9%	Wow!!!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_10%	That is so great!!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_11%	Congratulations!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_12%	I didn't do anything yet!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_14%	Hahahahahaha!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_15%	Hahahaha.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_16%	I'm so happy for you.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_18%	I'll design the sweetest mixture in your honor!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_19%	If it's in my honor, you don't need to make it so sweet.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_20%	Hahaha.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_22%	Hahaha, you're right.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_24%	It'll be delicious in any case. And very powerful.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_25%	Nice.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_30%	You will bury yourself in your garden and assimilate it all. You'll become a magical entity able to grow any kind of plant from your body in an instant.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_31%	That's...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_32%	Good?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_33%	I guess so. From what I read, it's something you'll do voluntarily, so...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_35%	But that sounds so... scary.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_36%	It will all make sense when the time comes.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_37%	But I don't want to lose any of you!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_38%	Why do you say that? I'm perfectly fine being friends with a magical entity that can summon any kind of plant!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_39%	I'm looking forward to it, in fact.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_40%	Ah...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_42%	Hahahaha, you're so silly.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_44%	It was a shock, but I guess it doesn't sound so bad when you look at it that way.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_45%	Everything will be fine.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_46%	Thank you.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_51%	Your garden will be taken from you and exploited by more powerful Witches.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_53%	What!?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_55%	Then what do I care about making it successful?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_57%	I may as well burn it to the ground right now.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_58%	Hey, hey, hey, come on.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_60%	I know it's a tough revelation.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_61%	But does knowing you will eventually die keep you from living?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_63%	But...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_64%	You make the most out of your time with your garden.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_65%	And be ready to part ways with it at any given moment.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_66%	That's basically life, isn't it?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_67%	That's a bit bleak...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_68%	All the moments, the knowledge, the experience... that won't be taken from you when you lose your garden.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_69%	And you'll be able to put that to good use. I'm sure.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_70%	Is that the cards speaking?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_71%	No, that I can guarantee you myself.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_72%	You are an outstanding Witch.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_73%	I'm sure you will keep creating good things and taking care of all of us even without your garden.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_74%	Hell, maybe what comes next is even better!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_76%	You really have a knack for putting a spin on the sour stuff, huh...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_77%	I've been giving bad news to fellow Witches for a long time.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_78%	I love you.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_79%	I love you, too.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_84%	Your garden will become the key to the survival of the coven during an extremely gruesome cosmic plague.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_86%	Oh, wow...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_87%	Happy to hear I'll be able to help, but I'm very worried right now.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_88%	Maybe this is the cause of the demise of the coven, like you predicted centuries ago?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_89%	I don't think so. I said your garden will be key to the survival of the coven.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_90%	Survival.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_92%	Right, right.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_93%	Then I better put myself to work if we want to minimize this plague's damage.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_94%	Thanks for the warning.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_95%	Don't burn yourself out. You're going to make it, no matter what.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_100%	Your garden will become sentient and will roam the cosmos blessing dead dominions. It'll bring life back to barren celestial bodies.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_102%	Oh my gods!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_104%	I'm going to be a mother!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_105%	Whoa, I wasn't expecting that reaction, haha.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_106%	Congratulations.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_107%	This is fantastic news!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_108%	I'd better take good care of my dear yard. I want it to become the most beautiful entity!
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_118%	Enough with the stress.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_119%	I'll take things slow and raise a happy garden.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_122%	Time to start getting honest and real with my sweet little garden.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_125%	I can't allow that corpse to remain inside my child's belly.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_126%	It's gonna be out as soon as I get back.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_129%	Enough with the pride.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_130%	I've gotta start showing the best values to my child.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_133%	I'm not gonna let Aedana ruin my child.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_134%	You'll see.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_137%	I'm not gonna let any other jealous Witch lay a finger on my child.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_138%	Those corrupted seeds are as good as done.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_140%	And, of course, you are going to be the Godmother, right?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_141%	If you don't mind having an exile as a Godmother, haha.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_142%	Shut up, silly.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_143%	I'll help you with anything I can, of course.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_144%	Thank you.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_149%	The Jade Sculptors will grow addicted to your product. They will become your biggest benefactors but also your biggest responsibility.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_150%	Holy shit.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_151%	I know.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_152%	I mean, having that much influence over the Jade Sculptors is going to prove very useful.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_153%	But I feel so sorry for them.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_154%	They're a peaceful lot, though. They won't give you much trouble.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_155%	I can ask them to build us a Cosmic Villa to live and study together, haha.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_156%	That's...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_157%	Not a bad idea at all.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_158%	I don't want anyone to be hooked on anything.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_159%	I know your predictions are inevitable.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_160%	But I'll try to find a healthy way out for them.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_161%	Or I'll give them the recipe of whatever they end up liking from my garden.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_162%	They're lucky it's your hands they're gonna be in.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_163%	I guess...
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_168%	With time, entropy will take your garden away. It will gradually wither and die. This will offer you the chance for a new beginning.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_170%	Oh, no... why?
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_171%	I'm sorry.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_172%	But I augur that, even with a sad ending, it's going to be a landmark in your career.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_173%	Maybe, but now it's taken all the fun away from taking care of those flowers.
%spread_jasmine_first_gardensfate_174%	Noooo... Come on.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_2%	Do you want to keep digging?
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_3%	That's alright, enough emotions for today.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_5%	I don't know how I've been getting by without your guidance for two centuries now.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_6%	That's because you're a badass Witch.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_7%	And my deck is only good for knowing in advance how amazing you are going to be.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_8%	But that's all on you, with or without divination.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_9%	Aw... Fortuna, you're too good.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_10%	I missed you so much.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_11%	I missed you too.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_12%	I need to go back to my garden now.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_13%	But I promise you, I'm gonna make up for all the time we've lost.
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_14%	See you soon!
%spread_jasmine_first_followup_15%	Thank you for coming.
%dahlia_entrance_2%	FORTUNAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
%dahlia_entrance_3%	Hahahaha.
%dahlia_entrance_4%	FORTUNAAAA!!!
%dahlia_entrance_5%	IT'S ME! DAHLIA!
%dahlia_entrance_6%	Hahahahaha.
%dahlia_entrance_7%	FORTUNA!
%dahlia_entrance_8%	It's really you! I can't believe it!
%dahlia_entrance_9%	I'm so happy to see you.
%dahlia_catchup_3%	What's up!
%dahlia_catchup_4%	Tell me what you've done these past two hundred years, come on!
%dahlia_catchup_5%	I...
%dahlia_catchup_6%	Two fucking centuries! Can you believe it!?
%dahlia_catchup_8%	That fucking Aedana. I swear to you she's gonna pay.
%dahlia_catchup_9%	Hahaha, slow down, please.
%dahlia_catchup_11%	Ah! I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
%dahlia_catchup_12%	I can't believe I'm finally speaking to you again.
%dahlia_catchup_13%	So, bring me up to speed.
%dahlia_catchup_14%	There's nothing much to tell, actually.
%dahlia_catchup_15%	It's been boring as hell here.
%dahlia_catchup_16%	I almost lost it, or maybe I did lose it, I don't really know anymore.
%dahlia_catchup_17%	I wouldn't be able to stay locked up and isolated for so long, I'm telling you.
%dahlia_catchup_18%	I would have gone after Aedana to kill or be killed.
%dahlia_catchup_19%	Ah... I wish I had your strength.
%dahlia_catchup_21%	What are you saying!? You're stronger than me!
%dahlia_catchup_22%	Two hundred years by yourself and you're still standing?
%dahlia_catchup_23%	I don't know anyone stronger than you!
%dahlia_catchup_25%	That's another kind of strength too, I guess.
%dahlia_catchup_26%	But I envy you, ready to go out with a bang. Not with a whimper, like me.
%dahlia_catchup_27%	But you didn't go yet, girl!
%dahlia_catchup_28%	I'm sure you've got plenty of pent up energy ready to get back at the universe whenever you regain your freedom.
%dahlia_catchup_29%	Actually, I've been crafting my own divination deck...
%dahlia_catchup_31%	Whaaaaat!?
%dahlia_catchup_33%	What do you mean "crafting"?
%dahlia_catchup_34%	You're making the cards and all?
%dahlia_catchup_35%	Yes, that's exactly it.
%dahlia_catchup_36%	I summon images from dominions of the cosmos for the backgrounds.
%dahlia_catchup_37%	Then I summon images of cosmic arcana and energy symbols.
%dahlia_catchup_38%	And I compose the design of the card with them.
%dahlia_catchup_39%	The meaning of the cards vary depending on which elements and energies I combine.
%dahlia_catchup_41%	That sounds crazy cool!
%dahlia_catchup_42%	Show me your favorite card!
%dahlia_catchup_43%	Well, the deck is still too green, I need to make a lot of cards.
%dahlia_catchup_45%	It doesn't matter. Show me your favorite so far!
%dahlia_catchup_2_4%	Whoa, "$Q". What a name for a card.
%dahlia_catchup_2_6%	And I love the art!
%dahlia_catchup_2_8%	This is already cooler than your old Tarot deck.
%dahlia_catchup_2_9%	What does this card mean?
%dahlia_catchup_2_10%	Mmm... These cards are harder to summarize than the Tarot ones.
%dahlia_catchup_2_12%	For example, this one could mean: $M...
%dahlia_catchup_2_13%	Whoa, and how do you know which meaning to pick when you draw one?
%dahlia_catchup_2_14%	Context and instinct.
%dahlia_catchup_2_15%	And you never doubt yourself? How can you tell you're not making it all up?
%dahlia_catchup_2_16%	It's natural to second guess yourself when you're a student of the divinatory arts.
%dahlia_catchup_2_17%	But I left that phase behind long ago... Back when I was a mortal girl.
%dahlia_catchup_2_18%	A prediction of mine has never failed to happen. Not a single time.
%dahlia_catchup_2_23%	I even foretold that Earth would end up being a utopia controlled by that prodigious AI that pulls the strings from the internet.
%dahlia_catchup_2_24%	Well, not exactly with those words, but my prediction was that "A non-human entity will rule over humanity and make them all happy."
%dahlia_catchup_2_27%	I even foretold that most humans would digitize themselves and go live inside servers, back on Earth.
%dahlia_catchup_2_30%	I even foretold the advent of Earth's domed cities.
%dahlia_catchup_2_33%	I even foretold that terrible plague that swept the Earth and destroyed eighty percent of its population.
%dahlia_catchup_2_36%	I even foretold that humans would leave Earth and start conquering their solar system.
%dahlia_catchup_2_38%	And I did this almost a century before it happened.
%dahlia_catchup_2_40%	Shit. That's amazing.
%dahlia_catchup_2_41%	Read the cards for me, please.
%dahlia_catchup_2_42%	Ah, sure... but don't you want to catch up first?
%dahlia_catchup_2_44%	This is catching up!
%dahlia_catchup_2_45%	Show me what you've got!
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_2%	Ok, what do you want to ask the deck?
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_3%	Oh, mmm...
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_4%	I want to know how you've been for these two centuries.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_5%	Eh?
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_6%	I can tell you that myself.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_7%	I don't think you can.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_8%	We Witches lie to ourselves by nature.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_9%	I bet I'm not the only one that will learn things about Fortuna with this reading.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_10%	Mmm...
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_11%	I accept with one condition:
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_12%	We look into your past, too.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_14%	I'm in.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_17%	We've got ourselves into a divination face off.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_18%	I don't know how you manage to draw me into these situations every time.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_20%	The cosmos brought me here to make you all feel alive, what can I say.
%spread_dahlia_first_intro_21%	Let's do this.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_7%	You've been plotting to leave the Coven and found your own clan of Warrior Witches.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_8%	Oh, shit. You should become an Arbiter.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_9%	Straight to the most problematic issue.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_10%	This sounds really dangerous. How deep into this plan are you?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_11%	Ah... pretty deep. Haven't got to the point of no return yet.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_12%	But if I snap my fingers, there's a good lot of Witches ready to fight our way out.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_13%	We've been discussing everything in front of a Minister of Secrets, so there's no risk of the word getting out until the day comes.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_14%	Hmm... I discovered it, though.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_15%	Nah, you're the only divination freak in our coven.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_17%	And I know I can trust you.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_19%	Sure, but please try to not hurt yourselves or anyone else on your way out, if it comes to that.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_21%	Not even Aedana?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_23%	Ah... It'll be easier for everyone if you manage not to harm anyone.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_25%	You're right.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_26%	But that's extremely naive on your part.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_27%	I'm sorry...
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_29%	It's alright. You're so cute. I love you.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_31%	I love you, too.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_34%	Oh, no, take out Aedana if you have the slightest chance, please.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_36%	Hahahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_38%	Damn girl, the isolation sure turned you wild.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_39%	But I like it.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_40%	Try not to put yourself in danger, in any case.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_41%	Ok, ok.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_46%	You fell in love with a Daemon of the White Sands and you're keeping your relationship hidden from the coven.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_48%	Hey! That's too personal!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_49%	Don't ask me to read into your past, then!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_50%	I love them! And no one will stop me!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_51%	Last time I checked it wasn't illegal to romance supernatural beings.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_52%	But it's shameful! They're my prey!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_53%	I make a living out of hunting Daemons!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_54%	What's everybody going to think!?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_55%	Come on, take it easy.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_56%	You're the most valued daggersmith of the coven. You're a valuable asset for many other covens, even.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_58%	So what makes my relationship valid is that it doesn't affect my performance, is that it?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_59%	No, no. I'm sorry. Of course not. You can love whoever you want.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_60%	I was just trying to comfort you by pointing out no one's gonna really care. Beyond the usual gossip.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_62%	And your friends are gonna be here for you no matter what.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_63%	Mmm... thank you.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_64%	You're not wrong.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_65%	Maybe I'll drop my guard and stop being so secretive about my relationship.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_66%	You can't experience a romance to the fullest if you aren't proud of it!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_67%	Whoa, you talk like you've got a good deal of experience.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_68%	You finally meet someone?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_69%	Ah... I... I don't...
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_71%	Hahahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_73%	It's alright, I know that you don't do relationships.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_74%	It was good advice, in any case.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_79%	You forged a Djinn Dagger to kill Aedana, but you got cold feet in the end.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_81%	Shit! Don't say those things out loud!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_82%	Do you want me burned?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_83%	Don't worry, you're safe here.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_86%	You know, I thought about you when I was preparing the... attack.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_87%	But even if Aedana died, you'd have to wait for a new leader to be elected.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_88%	And then make a plea to her to review your case.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_89%	It doesn't matter.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_90%	Please, don't commit murder, especially not on my behalf.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_91%	You know why I got cold feet?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_92%	I needed to confide in someone before going for it.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_93%	And I pictured saying all this to you or Jasmine.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_94%	And I couldn't get your blessing. Not even in my imagination.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_95%	So I let it go.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_96%	I'm glad to hear that.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_98%	You two are good friends even when simulated, hahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_100%	Just in case, double check with the non-imaginary versions of us, next time.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_102%	Hahahaha. You got it.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_104%	Thanks.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_107%	...Do you still have the Dagger?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_108%	Yes, why?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_109%	Do you want me to use it?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_110%	I wouldn't be against that.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_111%	It'd solve many of my problems.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_112%	I thought about you when I was preparing the... attack.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_113%	But even if Aedana died, you'd have to wait for a new leader to be elected.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_114%	And then make a plea to her to review your case.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_115%	I've been trapped here for two centuries.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_116%	All that process feels light in comparison.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_117%	I see...
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_118%	Maybe I'll rethink this and give it a shot.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_119%	Let me know if I can help in any way.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_124%	You had a falling out with Jasmine and you just recently patched it up.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_125%	Well, "recently." It's already been five years since we made up.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_126%	But considering we spent eighty years not speaking to each other, I guess recently still applies, yeah.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_127%	What happened?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_128%	I know there's always been a bit of friction between you two, but what got you to that extreme?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_129%	The stupidest thing.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_130%	Each of us made a new friend around the same time.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_131%	I met this sweet wonderful healer, Ventura.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_132%	I love hunting Daemons with her. We can take on very ambitious prey thanks to her arts.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_133%	She's a member of our coven now, by the way.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_134%	Jasmine met a snobby Starmancer, called Margaux.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_135%	She's legit and very powerful, but can get a bit patronizing sometimes.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_136%	Oh, I've never met a Starmancer in person. That's very cool.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_137%	The thing is that we're all alright, but Ventura and Margaux can't stand each other.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_138%	And we discovered it during this sweet get together in Jasmine's garden.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_139%	I can't even remember what the original discussion was about...
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_140%	But things escalated quickly and Jasmine and I went too far defending our guests.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_141%	And...
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_143%	I smashed one of Jasmine's pots against the tea table.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_144%	Come on... Dahlia!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_146%	I know, I know.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_147%	Still, this isn't the first time you've broken something of Jasmine's.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_148%	What took you so long to make up?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_149%	Mmm...
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_150%	Your absence.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_151%	You've always been the peacemaker between the two of us.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_153%	We really missed you, Fortuna.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_154%	Ah... you're going to make me cry.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_155%	I love you.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_156%	I love you, too.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_158%	All is well now, though.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_159%	We just know that we can't mix Ventura and Margaux.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_160%	Cool.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_165%	You're a mother now. You had a son with a shaman warrior.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_166%	Ah, yes...
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_167%	Congratulations! Why didn't you tell me earlier?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_168%	Well, I *was* a mother.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_169%	My son passed away years ago.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_170%	I'm so sorry to hear that.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_171%	Don't be!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_173%	He had a beautiful life! He died in his fifties, in a battle against the Vulcanfolk.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_174%	He was a brave warrior and became the loving father of three girls.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_175%	So you're a grandmother now!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_177%	Ah... I don't do grandchildren.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_178%	Maybe I'll tutor one of the girls if they ascend. They carry Witch blood, after all.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_179%	But I'm done with mortal affairs. Life is too fast and fragile at ground level.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_180%	Yeah... One of the toughest things for me after I ascended was watching Patrice wither away.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_181%	She had a great mortal life, stop feeling sorry for her.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_182%	I know, I know. Sometimes I'm even a bit envious.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_183%	But real life... that was never meant for me. A family, a job, a house... a car? That sounds so alien to me.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_185%	I can't picture you driving a machine either, hahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_186%	Earthlings are so weird!
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_188%	I agree.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_193%	You received a permanent wound that is going to kill you in about ninety years.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_194%	So that's it, huh.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_195%	Dahlia, I just foretold your demise.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_196%	...How can you be so calm?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_197%	We warriors are always ready for this day.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_198%	Right after the Jade Serpent bit me, back in the desert hunt, I knew that was it.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_199%	You're not telling me anything new.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_200%	Well, you are, actually:
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_201%	You're letting me know that I won't be killed for the next ninety years.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_202%	So I can know myself immortal in battle for this century.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_204%	My last deeds are going to become mythological, just you wait.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_205%	But... I'm going to miss you.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_207%	When I die, capture my arcane energy in a card.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_208%	That way I will always live through you.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_209%	I'll help you sew new stories.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_210%	What do you say?
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_211%	Dahlia... it will be my honor.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_212%	It's tough to love a warrior. I'm sorry.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_213%	You have to be true to your essence.
%spread_dahlia_first_dahliaspast_214%	Let's make the most of this century.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_2%	Mmm...
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_3%	This is so strange. I can't see a thing.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_4%	I've never tried to read into my own past. Maybe I'm not supposed to.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_5%	Oh... what a bummer.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_7%	I'm sorry. I've got nothing.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_8%	We can call off the reading about your past if you want.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_9%	Nah, a deal's a deal.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_10%	Do your worst.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_13%	I'm sorry I can't meet my end of the deal.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_14%	Do you want to try and ask something else?
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_15%	Nah... it's ok. I played and I lost.
%spread_dahlia_first_fortunaspast_16%	Not that I mind sharing stuff with my best friend, anyway!
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_3%	Would you like to ask anything else?
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_4%	Mmm...
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_5%	Maybe...
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_6%	Nah, that's enough fortune telling for today I think.
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_9%	Mmm...
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_10%	I don't want to overstep if you don't feel comfortable with this, but...
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_11%	Since I've got the deck out and all, would you like me to look into the Daemon that visits your dreams?
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_13%	Hey! How do you know about that?
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_14%	Are you psychic now too?
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_15%	Ah... Haha... no.
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_16%	Jasmine told me. She's a bit worried about you.
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_18%	Ah, Jasmine. She just loves her gossip, eh...
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_19%	Fine. Since the cat's out of the bag I wouldn't mind an extra card.
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_21%	Tell me more about this Daemon.
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_22%	Thank you.
%spread_dahlia_first_check_0_23%	Here we go.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_6%	The Daemon with your mother's face is trying to give birth to you again. You are going to be reincarnated, keeping all your memories.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_8%	So that was it!
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_9%	That's why it wouldn't stop chasing me in my dreams!
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_10%	But...
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_11%	Reincarnation?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_13%	Does that mean I'm going to die?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_14%	I believe so, yes.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_15%	How!?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_16%	That I can't tell.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_17%	But it's clear to me that you are going to keep your memories.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_18%	So it's going to feel more like a... transition.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_19%	You won't be Dahlia anymore, but you won't forget the coven, or any of this.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_21%	Mmm...
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_22%	As a Warrior Witch I've always been ready to face death.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_23%	But weirdly, reincarnation feels somehow scarier than just falling in combat.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_24%	One's never ready for the cosmos.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_25%	You bet.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_28%	Does that mean I'll be able to escape death!?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_29%	Well, to be precise, you will die.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_30%	But you will also be reborn.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_31%	So the Jade Serpent's wound won't be the end of me!?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_33%	That's just amazing!
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_34%	I thought you Warrior Witches were always ready to fall?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_36%	Yeah, I mean, I'm prepared to face death as stoically as necessary.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_37%	But come on, reincarnation sure beats oblivion.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_39%	Plus I'll get to keep my memories!
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_40%	I feel like I just won the cosmic lottery!
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_41%	You won't be Dahlia anymore once you die and are reborn, though.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_42%	You will transition into another being.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_44%	Ok, ok. I'll make the most out of this existence no matter what happens next.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_49%	The Daemon has recovered some wisdom your mother didn't have time to transmit when you were a mortal. Expect access to secret knowledge from the beyond.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_51%	Really, mom!?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_52%	She's been haunting my dreams just because she forgot to tell me something?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_53%	This is so embarrassing.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_54%	I don't think we're in a "don't forget to brush your teeth" situation.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_55%	I foresee that this is going to be a powerful revelation of something your mother has realized in the afterlife.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_57%	You are very fortunate. It's extremely rare to come by this kind of wisdom.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_58%	Ok, ok. Gotcha.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_59%	I'll try to be more welcoming the next time the Dream Daemon visits.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_60%	See if I can start a conversation.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_61%	I'll keep you posted.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_62%	You don't need to, it's something between you and your mother.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_63%	Although... if it's not extremely personal I'll appreciate you letting me know about it, hehe.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_64%	Count on it. I owe you.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_69%	Your mortal mother's soul has crystallized into a Daemon. She has come to take you to the afterlife with her.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_71%	She wants to kill me!?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_72%	I don't believe your mother's Daemon sees this as killing you, but as reuniting the two of you.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_73%	Although for all intents and purposes this process involves your death, yes.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_75%	And is there anything that I can do?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_76%	Sure, you can fend off this Daemon the same as you hunt the rest of them.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_77%	It'll simply be more personal and emotional since you'll be fighting against your mother's ghost.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_80%	Mmm... I'll try to capture it alive, so I can shed some light on why this is happening.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_81%	Were you on bad terms with your mother when she passed away?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_82%	I barely remember, to be honest.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_83%	It's been centuries since I became a Witch, and she died when I was seventeen years old.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_84%	She taught me how to fight, how to tend wounds...
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_85%	How to shape metal, how to work the bones...
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_86%	I only have good memories.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_87%	Well, maybe she just misses you so much her spirit was corrupted and wants you back at any cost.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_88%	Mmm... we'll see.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_92%	Hah, get in line, mother. The Jade Serpent came first.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_93%	Fending off a Daemon with your mother's essence, huh... Sounds like a nice chapter for the Dahlia book of legends.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_98%	A Daemon has absorbed the essence of your mother's grave and is going to give birth to a Shadow version of yourself, who will try to hunt you down.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_100%	That's playing dirty!
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_101%	Are the Daemons of the White Sands so afraid of me that they decided to clone me to get me?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_102%	Don't underestimate this being.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_103%	She's going to have all of your skills and none of your compassion.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_105%	That shadow doesn't stand a chance against me, then.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_106%	How come?
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_107%	A Witch Warrior without emotion is but an edgeless weapon.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_108%	Oh, I love when you act all zen.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_110%	Hahahaha, you just ruin my cool with those comments.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_112%	I'm happy to see you feel confident against such a threat.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_113%	Now I'm sure you can handle it.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_114%	I will. I'm used to dealing with all sorts of curses given my occupation.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_115%	Don't you worry, baby.
%spread_dahlia_first_dreamdaemon_116%	I'm here to help, in any case.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_2%	I gotta hand it to you, this new deck is something else.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_3%	Congratulations.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_5%	Thank you.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_6%	I'm still trying to get the hang of it.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_8%	Can't wait to witness what you do once you reach your full potential.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_9%	It's going to be scary, for sure.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_11%	Hahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_12%	Haha...
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_14%	By the way, I have a favor to ask you that... I don't know if it's going to be too much.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_15%	Hey, I'd do anything for you. Whatever you need, Dahlia.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_16%	The thing is that the favor isn't for me, that's why I'm hesitating to ask.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_17%	A good friend of mine is in a bit of trouble, and having just seen how amazing your new deck is, I wonder if you could help her.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_18%	What happened?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_19%	Her name is Grethe, she is a Witch Architect... she mostly works asteroids and wandering moons into temples.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_20%	She is a pretty young Witch, joined the coven around 130 years ago, so you wouldn't know her.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_21%	But she's the purest, I'm sure you'll love her.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_22%	Sure, I'd love to meet her. But stop beating around the bush. What happened?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_23%	You must promise you won't tell anyone.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_24%	I promise.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_25%	She tried to summon a Behemoth.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_26%	W-whaa..?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_29%	A Beheemoz, w-what's that?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_30%	Wow, that's, like, super illegal, isn't it?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_31%	I can relate. Tell me more.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_35%	A Beheemoz, w-what's that?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_36%	A Behemoth, Fortuna. You know what I'm talking about.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_37%	Those beings exogenous to the very fabric of the universe. Scary and powerful.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_38%	You talked to me about them many times.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_39%	Ah... yes, Behemoths, yeah, almost forgot about them.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_43%	Wow, that's, like, super illegal, isn't it?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_44%	Indeed. That's why we need to keep all this from Aedana's ears.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_45%	If the coven learns about it they'll tear Grethe to pieces.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_46%	Last time I checked, the punishment was Cosmic erasure...
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_50%	I can relate. Tell me more.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_52%	What's your stance on this?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_53%	That I want to protect my friends, of course.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_54%	Happy to hear that.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_55%	What kind of Behemoth did Grethe try to summon?
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_56%	Well... to protect me from its influence, she didn't give many details.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_57%	Grethe tried to summon a Builder Behemoth, to help her craft a special altar out of a Titan's skull or something like that.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_58%	But since she's an architect, their essences were so similar the Behemoth got entangled with her own being. They fused.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_59%	She hasn't even let me see her since the summoning went awry.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_60%	Oh, my, this sounds grave.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_61%	She's desperate. That's why I'm coming to you.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_62%	Your deck may be the only hope for her at this point.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_63%	She can't stay hidden from the coven forever, and when they find out...
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_64%	I don't even want to think about it.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_65%	I'll help her. I'll do everything in my power, I promise.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_66%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_67%	I must go now.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_68%	I'll tell Grethe to write to you, and...
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_70%	Thank you for the reading.
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_72%	You're the best! And I love you and I am so happy to have you back!
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_73%	Hahaha, me too, Dahlia!
%spread_dahlia_first_followup_75%	See you soon!
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_2%	What a heartwarming reunion.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_3%	I didn't take you for the intense-friendship kind of character.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_4%	It's all because of them. They're just too good and don't mind bearing with a weirdo like me.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_5%	Don't sell yourself short. I'd say you're still the most interesting of the lot.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_6%	I'm sure they experience the same kind of attraction I feel towards you.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_7%	Come on, stop buttering me up, I'm not that charismatic.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_8%	I wouldn't say it's charisma. It's something more primal, like how mortals can't avoid staring at a flame.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_9%	You woke up poetic today, huh...
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_10%	Say, who do you like best, Jasmine or Dahlia?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_13%	Jasmine.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_14%	Dahlia.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_15%	What kind of childish question is that?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_19%	What kind of childish question is that?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_20%	Indulge me.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_21%	I'm not asking this just to annoy you.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_22%	As your mentor, I consider this an important introspection exercise.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_23%	It'll make your divination better.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_24%	Don't pretend to be all wise now, I know for a fact that you just enjoy spilling the tea.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_26%	Hahahahaha!
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_28%	I'll give you a cop out option, even!
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_29%	Come on, just play along.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_31%	Who do you like best: Jasmine, Dahlia, or me?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_34%	Jasmine.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_35%	Dahlia.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_36%	You, Ábramar.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_37%	Enough. I won't go there.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_41%	Jasmine.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_42%	Oh, and why do you like Jasmine best?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_45%	She's so sweet and agreeable.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_46%	She is smart and considerate.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_47%	She's very delicate and sensitive.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_48%	She's just too pretty.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_52%	She's so sweet and agreeable.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_53%	She seems like an easy girl to have around, yes.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_54%	So, basically, you prefer her because she's less bothersome than Dahlia.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_55%	Hey, I didn't say that. Jasmine is someone whose presence is comforting.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_56%	But I love Dahlia, too. You're the one who came up with the stupid idea of making me choose.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_57%	Alright, alright, I know.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_61%	She is smart and considerate.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_62%	Looks like someone you could converse with for hours, yup.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_63%	On the other hand, I think I'd get bored of Dahlia really quick.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_64%	Dahlia, she seems simple, don't you think?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_65%	Hey, watch it.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_66%	Dahlia is uncomplicated and pretty straightforward, but she might be smarter than you, and she could definitely kick your ass.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_68%	You think?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_69%	Want to find out?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_71%	Hahahahaha.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_73%	Easy, I was just pushing your buttons to learn where you stand on each of them.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_74%	They have all my respect, I swear.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_75%	You better.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_79%	She is very delicate and sensitive.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_80%	So what you like about her is her aura of fragility?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_81%	What? No. She's not fragile, trust me.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_82%	The opposite, she handles you with care, and has a lot of empathy.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_86%	She's just too pretty.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_87%	Wow, I'd never have guessed you'd value beauty over other aspects.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_88%	Ah, well...
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_90%	Hahahahaha, it's alright.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_92%	She is especially beautiful, I feel you.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_93%	I feel a bit embarrassed now...
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_94%	Nothing wrong with appreciating beauty.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_98%	Dahlia.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_99%	Oh, and why do you like Dahlia best?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_102%	She's so pure and straightforward.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_103%	Her powerful attitude makes me feel safe.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_104%	She's so funny and full of energy!
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_105%	She's just too sexy.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_109%	She's so pure and straightforward.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_110%	She felt extremely transparent and true.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_111%	That may be why she isn't as attractive to me as you are.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_112%	Sincere people are a bit boring.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_113%	Friends aren't there to amuse you.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_114%	That kind of truth is the most desirable aspect in a friend. Just being around her is an act of healing.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_115%	Not my jam, but sure.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_119%	Her powerful attitude makes me feel safe.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_120%	Her confidence grants her an unbreakable aura, you're right.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_121%	I love strong Witches. Wouldn't mind having been summoned by her, I tell you.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_122%	Me neither.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_123%	Haha, what?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_124%	Haha, nothing.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_128%	She's so funny and full of energy!
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_129%	You bet. Your tiny house could barely withstand her presence.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_130%	Haha, Dahlia's just like that. Wherever she sets foot, everything is revitalized... or broken, hahaha.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_131%	Heh, her energy can be contagious, alright.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_135%	She's just too sexy.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_137%	Oh, wow! Hahahaha.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_139%	You never cease to surprise!
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_140%	I'd have never said you'd pick based on attractiveness.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_142%	I mean, just look at Dahlia, she's majestic.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_143%	You are absolutely right.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_147%	You, Ábramar.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_148%	Oh, is that true? And why do you like me best?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_151%	Your adorable need for validation.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_152%	We're partners in crime.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_153%	You are the only one I can confide in.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_154%	For your sensual body.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_158%	Your adorable need for validation.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_160%	HAHAHAHAHAHA!!
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_162%	You snarky little thing.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_163%	You're pushing it too far. Be happy that I chose you.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_165%	It's always going to be tough love with you, I know.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_169%	We're partners in crime.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_170%	Now we share a bond I've never shared with anyone.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_171%	Rise together or fall together.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_173%	Oooh, I like that.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_175%	We won't fall. I won't let it happen.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_176%	I've got your back, partner.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_177%	Thank you.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_181%	You are the only one I can confide in.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_182%	I'm not sure if my best friends will understand what I've done to regain my freedom.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_183%	Until then, you are my cosmic pillar.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_184%	"Until then"?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_185%	I'm your favorite provided I keep being useful?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_186%	What? Don't be so clingy.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_187%	We'll see how this relationship evolves.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_188%	Hmmm... Ok, ok.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_192%	For your sensual body.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_193%	What!?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_194%	You asked who I like best.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_195%	Between Jasmine, Dahlia and you. You're the one I find most attractive.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_196%	E-eh... I wasn't asking it in that sense...
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_197%	But... Mmm...
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_198%	Thank you. I like you, too.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_199%	Hahaha, some Behemoth you are.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_200%	You caught me off guard, that's all.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_201%	You've got some bizarre tastes, let me tell you that.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_202%	Hey, don't judge.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_206%	Enough. I won't go there.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_207%	Bah, you're no fun.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_208%	And you're too immature for being older than this universe.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_209%	It is precisely because I have witnessed everything that I know life is but a game.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_210%	You really have some nerve.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_212%	Hahahahaha.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_214%	You'll understand, someday.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_219%	Well, thanks for indulging me.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_222%	I swear to you this isn't gratuitous.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_223%	I have my ways of mentoring, even if you find them ludicrous.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_224%	As long as you help me through my exile you can be as silly as you want.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_225%	At your service.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_226%	What's your plan now?
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_227%	I think I'll make some cards while I wait for a familiar from that architect, Grethe.
%abramar_friends_wrapup_c3_228%	Good, let's build that deck.
%louise_intro_3%	Ah...
%louise_intro_4%	Welcome.
%louise_intro_5%	Welcome!
%louise_intro_6%	Ah!
%louise_intro_7%	Hi! What's your name?
%louise_intro_8%	Fortuna! Your name is Fortuna! I'm sorry!
%louise_intro_9%	I'm sorry.
%louise_intro_10%	Hahaha.
%louise_intro_11%	Nice to meet you.
%louise_intro_12%	Your name is Louise, right?
%louise_intro_13%	No need to be so nervous. Any friend of Jasmine is welcome here.
%louise_intro_14%	Ah... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
%louise_intro_15%	It's just that I've heard so many things about you that now I feel like I'm meeting a celebrity or something.
%louise_intro_16%	Oh, yeah? What have you heard?
%louise_intro_17%	Ah! All good things! Don't worry!
%louise_intro_18%	Mostly from Jasmine. She loves you and missed you so much, you know that?
%louise_intro_19%	Hahaha, I missed her a lot, too.
%louise_intro_20%	Why don't you take a deep breath and tell me a bit about yourself?
%louise_intro_21%	Ah...
%louise_intro_23%	Ok, sorry.
%louise_intro_24%	My name is Louise, and...
%louise_intro_26%	Ah... I'm sorry, I'm drawing a blank.
%louise_intro_27%	It's ok. How about I ask you some questions, would that be alright?
%louise_intro_28%	Ok, that's good, thank you.
%louise_intro_33%	Let's see...
%louise_intro_36%	What's your specialty?
%louise_intro_37%	How do you know Jasmine?
%louise_intro_38%	What do you like to do in your spare time?
%louise_intro_39%	Why did you come to see me?
%louise_intro_45%	What's your specialty?
%louise_intro_46%	Oh, right!
%louise_intro_48%	I am a Pithweaver.
%louise_intro_49%	Oh, that sounds cool. What does it mean?
%louise_intro_50%	I can harvest mortals' entelechy.
%louise_intro_51%	It's a magic substance that defines one's behavior and desires.
%louise_intro_52%	A single mortal barely produces enough thread, but if you find a community with a rich collective subconscious, you can weave whole clothes and capes.
%louise_intro_53%	Wow, that's hard to picture, but it sounds fun.
%louise_intro_54%	And these clothes you craft have magical properties, I imagine.
%louise_intro_55%	That's right.
%louise_intro_56%	It depends on the kind of community you pull the thread from.
%louise_intro_57%	As a quick example, the yarn extracted from a band of artists could make a lovely scarf that stimulates the wearer's creativity.
%louise_intro_58%	I love it already!
%louise_intro_59%	I'll weave something sometime for you!
%louise_intro_60%	What kind of entelechy would you fancy most?
%louise_intro_63%	From moms and their children.
%louise_intro_64%	From soldiers and warriors.
%louise_intro_65%	From astronauts.
%louise_intro_70%	From moms and their children.
%louise_intro_71%	Oh! How sweet. That's a really powerful energy, let me tell you.
%louise_intro_76%	From soldiers and warriors.
%louise_intro_77%	Uh... Ok.
%louise_intro_78%	What's the matter? Did I say something wrong?
%louise_intro_79%	Not really. It's a powerful source of substance, closely linked to Fire magic.
%louise_intro_80%	But... not my favorite collective, to be honest.
%louise_intro_81%	I'm sorry, I didn't stop to think about that.
%louise_intro_82%	I'll pick something else!
%louise_intro_83%	Ah, don't worry about it. Coincidentally, I have a surplus of that kind of thread.
%louise_intro_88%	From astronauts.
%louise_intro_89%	Wow! No one's ever asked me to harvest from them!
%louise_intro_90%	Now I'm excited to see what comes of this.
%louise_intro_94%	If I get the chance I'll bring you a nice cloth as a thank you present for having me.
%louise_intro_95%	Thank you so much!
%louise_intro_97%	Do you want to know anything else?
%louise_intro_98%	You make it sound like this is an interrogation, haha.
%louise_intro_99%	No, no! Sorry! I'm having a good time!
%louise_intro_100%	But it's easier for me if you ask me things.
%louise_intro_101%	Sure.
%louise_intro_106%	How do you know Jasmine?
%louise_intro_107%	Ah!
%louise_intro_109%	She hired me to weave a special net to gather dew from her greenhouse.
%louise_intro_110%	It's one of the projects I'm most proud of.
%louise_intro_112%	I harvested the entelechy from desert nomads to make it.
%louise_intro_114%	The dew filtered through this net makes an astounding base substance for all kinds of flower-based potions.
%louise_intro_115%	Jasmine's brews became quite popular after my contribution, hehe.
%louise_intro_116%	It's been centuries since I've had something from Jasmine, I can't wait to try this improved version!
%louise_intro_117%	Together we also developed some magical tea bags that multiply the fragrance of dried mixtures!
%louise_intro_118%	That is so cool!
%louise_intro_119%	Now I see how you two became close.
%louise_intro_120%	Both you and Jasmine are super crafty. It's gotta be so much fun to find someone to share your passion with.
%louise_intro_121%	It is indeed! I always have a great time with Jasmine!
%louise_intro_122%	Nice.
%louise_intro_123%	...
%louise_intro_125%	...More questions?
%louise_intro_130%	What do you like to do in your spare time?
%louise_intro_131%	Oh, Mmm...
%louise_intro_133%	I love reading, playing my multi-neck bass and spying on mortals.
%louise_intro_134%	Oh, wow, that's weird, reading?
%louise_intro_136%	Ah... Is it not hip to read anymore?
%louise_intro_137%	Hip? Hahaha. I was kidding! The odd part is spying on mortals!
%louise_intro_138%	And I'm a bit curious about the multi-neck bass too, to be honest.
%louise_intro_139%	Aaaah... Hahaha...
%louise_intro_141%	I play a custom bass guitar with three necks, since I have multiple arms and all that...
%louise_intro_143%	But I don't play it in front of people!
%louise_intro_145%	I only use it to meditate. It's really soothing to weave several deep melodies together.
%louise_intro_146%	I like the idea. I wish I could hear it someday.
%louise_intro_147%	What about spying on mortals?
%louise_intro_148%	I love making myself invisible and just watching them go about their lives.
%louise_intro_149%	Comparing lifestyles from many different cultures and planets.
%louise_intro_150%	After many years of observation, I gained the ability to perceive their entelechy.
%louise_intro_151%	That's how I found my calling and developed my Pithweaving.
%louise_intro_153%	Pithweaving?
%louise_intro_155%	Ah, sorry, that's my special ability.
%louise_intro_156%	I can tell you more about it if you're interested...
%louise_intro_157%	Whatever you want to ask is cool, actually... haha...
%louise_intro_158%	Hahaha, relax.
%louise_intro_161%	That's so interesting.
%louise_intro_162%	I didn't care much about mortals even back when I was one of them.
%louise_intro_163%	I guess there's a great deal to learn from mortality too, isn't there?
%louise_intro_164%	Yes! I love mortals!
%louise_intro_165%	I can tell, haha.
%louise_intro_167%	Ah... I hope it isn't too weird.
%louise_intro_168%	It's perfectly fine, don't worry.
%louise_intro_169%	Is there anything else you want to know?
%louise_intro_174%	Why did you come to see me?
%louise_intro_175%	Ah... yes, better get to business.
%louise_intro_176%	I'm here precisely because of my Pithweaver skills.
%louise_intro_178%	As I explained, the entelechy from mortals varies depending on the community they're in and the lives they lead.
%louise_intro_179%	The universe provides enough different contexts to find whichever kind of energy fits your purposes.
%louise_intro_180%	But, of course...
%louise_intro_181%	There is the shortcut of manipulating mortals to produce the substance you need.
%louise_intro_182%	For example, you could add lust serum to the water supply of a community to harvest massive amounts of sexual energy from their orgies.
%louise_intro_183%	Quite an example.
%louise_intro_185%	Ah! Not that I've tried this more than once!
%louise_intro_186%	I usually prefer all natural, chaos-bred entelechy.
%louise_intro_188%	The thing is, Aedana saw a lot of potential in one of my projects.
%louise_intro_195%	It started back when the worldwide digital migration happened on Earth.
%louise_intro_196%	So many lives lost, even if their souls were replicated in their servers. Humanity was producing an unprecedented amount of corpses.
%louise_intro_199%	It started when humanity was forced to build massive domed cities all over planet Earth.
%louise_intro_200%	Many projects didn't start on time and a huge number of cities were lost to the relentless advance of the scorching sandstorms.
%louise_intro_201%	And then the survivors gathered around the functioning domes and fought for their resources.
%louise_intro_204%	It started when that super bacteria decimated all life on Earth.
%louise_intro_205%	Every time humanity has endured a worldwide epidemic, a great deal of energy has been released from the planet.
%louise_intro_206%	But since Earth had never been so crowded, the amount of corpses all over the world was unprecedented.
%louise_intro_209%	It started back when earthlings began their conquest of space.
%louise_intro_210%	The colonies on Mars were proliferating at a supernatural speed.
%louise_intro_211%	Conflict spread through every bordering nation, on Earth and on any planet mankind set foot on.
%louise_intro_214%	It started when that almighty AI rose to lead planet Earth's population.
%louise_intro_215%	In a matter of years, human society suffered severe structural changes, and any element that threatened that change was rapidly purged from the equation.
%louise_intro_216%	Humanity has never endured such an abrupt transformation.
%louise_intro_218%	I felt an imperative need to witness that massive event. It all oozed an otherworldly energy.
%louise_intro_219%	So I spent decades spinning thread from it.
%louise_intro_220%	And as it happens, that substance can create an extremely effective weapon for capturing Behemoths.
%louise_intro_221%	What? Really? How so?
%louise_intro_222%	Earth's entelechy was highly... "contaminated." It was as if the whole planet's fate had somehow been sealed.
%louise_intro_223%	And Behemoths happen to be extremely susceptible to reality-altering arts.
%louise_intro_224%	I used that substance to weave gladiator-like webs that can suck any entangled Behemoth dry of their magic.
%louise_intro_225%	You can also craft decent pieces of armor against Behemoth spells.
%louise_intro_226%	Aah.. haha-ha, and why is Aedana so interested in developing such armaments?
%louise_intro_227%	The Cosmic Echoes warned her that Behemoths will threaten the coven, so she wants to prepare accordingly.
%louise_intro_228%	The problem is that even with such a tremendous phenomenon I only managed to pull enough thread to craft one set of web and armor.
%louise_intro_229%	And Aedana is set on developing a massive weapon to erase Behemoths from this plane of existence entirely.
%louise_intro_230%	I don't believe I have what it takes to see this through.
%louise_intro_231%	What do you need to make this happen, exactly?
%louise_intro_232%	Aedana discovered that if you promote war and stir conflict in this new society, the reality-altering arts that engulfed the planet try to fight back.
%louise_intro_233%	As if everyone was programmed to preserve the status quo.
%louise_intro_234%	In this process, humanity's entelechy once again shows the characteristics it had when the massive change happened.
%louise_intro_235%	And I can harvest it.
%louise_intro_236%	Uhh... so what are you...?
%louise_intro_237%	Aedana tasked me with provoking World War III.
%louise_intro_240%	Do you want me to help you cause it?
%louise_intro_241%	That's terrible! We can't allow that!
%louise_intro_245%	Do you want me to help you cause it?
%louise_intro_246%	...Can you?
%louise_intro_247%	Maybe. We can use my deck to look for a way to make it possible.
%louise_intro_249%	Urgh...
%louise_intro_250%	What's the matter?
%louise_intro_251%	Don't you think that driving a civilization to... Ah... I don't know...
%louise_intro_252%	Isn't causing total war evil?
%louise_intro_255%	Mortals are just another resource.
%louise_intro_256%	You're right. I'm sorry.
%louise_intro_261%	Mortals are just another resource.
%louise_intro_262%	Same as they exploit the land, we can exploit them.
%louise_intro_263%	Ah... I came to you in the hopes of avoiding this.
%louise_intro_264%	But I guess I was just being naive. I should comply with the orders of the leader.
%louise_intro_265%	It's a lot less trouble. Otherwise you'll end up exiled just like me.
%louise_intro_267%	Ah... ok.
%louise_intro_268%	So what now, do we ask your cards what to do?
%louise_intro_269%	Sure, let's consult the deck.
%louise_intro_274%	You're right. I'm sorry.
%louise_intro_275%	I've spent too much time confined and I've lost touch with reality.
%louise_intro_276%	I came to you in the hope of avoiding hurting anyone.
%louise_intro_277%	I love mortals!
%louise_intro_278%	It's hard enough for me to stay away and refrain from saving every single one of them, how am I supposed to lure them into conflict!?
%louise_intro_279%	Ok, ok, I get you.
%louise_intro_280%	Let's look at your options through my deck, ok?
%louise_intro_282%	Yes, please!
%louise_intro_287%	That's terrible! We can't allow that!
%louise_intro_288%	Exactly!
%louise_intro_289%	But I don't want to anger Aedana!
%louise_intro_290%	There's already been talk of expelling me from the coven should I fail to deliver.
%louise_intro_291%	Isn't there a way out of this?
%louise_intro_292%	This is totally unfair. Aedana is pushing it too far.
%louise_intro_293%	Let's take a look at what the cards have to say.
%spread_louise_intro_6%	I need you to tell me exactly what you want to ask the deck.
%spread_louise_intro_8%	First, the most important thing. What should I do with Earth?
%spread_louise_intro_10%	That's if I should do anything at all with it.
%spread_louise_intro_11%	Understood.
%spread_louise_intro_12%	Then...
%spread_louise_intro_15%	This is a bit embarrassing.
%spread_louise_intro_16%	But I happen to be in love with a mortal.
%spread_louise_intro_17%	That's totally cool!
%spread_louise_intro_18%	The thing is, he doesn't know I'm a Witch.
%spread_louise_intro_19%	I present myself to him in the form of a regular woman.
%spread_louise_intro_27%	He is flesh and blood, and lives with a human tribe outside of the servers.
%spread_louise_intro_30%	He's a scavenger that survives outside the domes.
%spread_louise_intro_33%	He's a fisherman that roams around the ruins of Montpellier.
%spread_louise_intro_36%	He's a smuggler in one of Earth's remaining colonies.
%spread_louise_intro_39%	He's a member of the resistance that fights the AI that rules Earth.
%spread_louise_intro_42%	He doesn't have an easy life...
%spread_louise_intro_43%	It breaks my heart, and I wish I could save him.
%spread_louise_intro_45%	But I'm afraid to show him my true nature.
%spread_louise_intro_46%	I'm sure he's noticed there's something special about me, but still...
%spread_louise_intro_47%	So, that's another question:
%spread_louise_intro_48%	What should I do about my mortal lover?
%spread_louise_intro_50%	My advice is not to get attached to mortals. They wither too fast.
%spread_louise_intro_51%	But sure, let's check what the cards have to say about him.
%spread_louise_intro_52%	Yes, please.
%spread_louise_intro_53%	I'd also like to know how to handle Aedana.
%spread_louise_intro_55%	Handle her?
%spread_louise_intro_56%	I'm sure she's going to be really upset when she finds out I want to quit.
%spread_louise_intro_57%	I don't want to be expelled or exiled...
%spread_louise_intro_58%	Is there any way to escape her wrath?
%spread_louise_intro_59%	I wish I knew.
%spread_louise_intro_60%	That's going to be a hard one. But this is a new deck, maybe it will find a solution.
%spread_louise_intro_61%	I'm shuffling the cards now. Keep your questions in your thoughts.
%spread_louise_intro_65%	Uhh...
%spread_louise_intro_66%	Actually I'm a bit scared.
%spread_louise_intro_67%	I don't want to ask a deck how to cause war.
%spread_louise_intro_68%	I'm sorry, Fortuna.
%spread_louise_intro_69%	That's alright. We won't ask anything you don't want to.
%spread_louise_intro_70%	Yes, I'd rather handle it myself. This isn't the solution I was hoping for after all.
%spread_louise_intro_71%	I would like to ask about something else, though...
%spread_louise_intro_72%	Sure, go ahead.
%spread_louise_intro_75%	Especially now there's a risk of war spreading all over the planet.
%spread_louise_intro_76%	Should I show him my true nature and take him off world?
%spread_louise_intro_77%	Should I forget about him?
%spread_louise_intro_78%	What should I do about him, Fortuna?
%spread_louise_intro_80%	My advice is not to get attached to mortals. They wither too fast.
%spread_louise_intro_81%	But sure, let's check what the cards have to say about him.
%spread_louise_intro_82%	Yes, please.
%spread_louise_planetearth_9%	We already established that I won't have to comply with Aedana's orders.
%spread_louise_planetearth_10%	So why read about exploiting planet Earth?
%spread_louise_planetearth_11%	Well, we already asked the question. We might as well check what the deck has to say.
%spread_louise_planetearth_12%	Maybe you'll need to harvest this specific entelechy in the future.
%spread_louise_planetearth_13%	Knowledge is an asset.
%spread_louise_planetearth_14%	Mmm... ok!
%spread_louise_planetearth_15%	Ahem, here's my reading:
%spread_louise_planetearth_21%	You need to find other ways to disrupt reality. War isn't the only way to mess with the established order.
%spread_louise_planetearth_22%	Oh, I've never looked at it that way!
%spread_louise_planetearth_23%	But...
%spread_louise_planetearth_24%	That's easier said than done...
%spread_louise_planetearth_25%	Do you want me to draw an extra card to look for ideas?
%spread_louise_planetearth_26%	Wow, can your deck do that?
%spread_louise_planetearth_27%	Of course. We can explore any concept we want.
%spread_louise_planetearth_29%	Card reading isn't just for divination.
%spread_louise_planetearth_30%	In fact, I feel the cards work at their best when you use them for reflection.
%spread_louise_planetearth_31%	How cool!
%spread_louise_planetearth_36%	Earth won't give you what you need, no matter what you do.
%spread_louise_planetearth_37%	So it was impossible all along, hmm...
%spread_louise_planetearth_44%	Maybe you'll find another spot in the cosmos to draw this reality-altering entelechy from.
%spread_louise_planetearth_45%	The universe is immense. I'm sure there must be other anomalies where you can find the right energy.
%spread_louise_planetearth_46%	Urgh... I agree. My biggest concern is how to convince Aedana.
%spread_louise_planetearth_47%	Well, we have a card slot reserved for that, don't we?
%spread_louise_planetearth_48%	Ah! Of course!
%spread_louise_planetearth_51%	Well, who cares.
%spread_louise_planetearth_52%	It's official. I'm going to stand up to Aedana.
%spread_louise_planetearth_53%	There's no other way out of this.
%spread_louise_planetearth_54%	I wish you the best.
%spread_louise_planetearth_55%	Thank you.
%spread_louise_planetearth_58%	I hope the cards are right and Aedana will be sympathetic about all this.
%spread_louise_planetearth_59%	She will be, the cards are clear.
%spread_louise_planetearth_60%	You need to be brave.
%spread_louise_planetearth_61%	Alright.
%spread_louise_planetearth_64%	Good thing I'm planning on shaking off Aedana with some lies.
%spread_louise_planetearth_65%	This better work, Fortuna.
%spread_louise_planetearth_66%	I am certain it will. The deck was clear about it.
%spread_louise_planetearth_67%	Ok, ok...
%spread_louise_planetearth_70%	I guess it's official. I'm abandoning the coven.
%spread_louise_planetearth_71%	Good thing I consulted with you beforehand so I have a head start.
%spread_louise_planetearth_72%	I'm sorry...
%spread_louise_planetearth_73%	It's not your fault.
%spread_louise_planetearth_74%	Thanks for advising me, in any case.
%spread_louise_planetearth_77%	How am I supposed to show progress like this?
%spread_louise_planetearth_78%	I am officially screwed.
%spread_louise_planetearth_79%	Maybe you'll find another spot in the cosmos to draw this reality-altering entelechy from.
%spread_louise_planetearth_80%	The universe is immense. I'm sure there must be other anomalies where you can find the right energy.
%spread_louise_planetearth_81%	Urgh... I agree. My biggest concern is how to convince Aedana.
%spread_louise_planetearth_82%	She'll have to understand. There's no way around it.
%spread_louise_planetearth_83%	I hope you're right.
%spread_louise_planetearth_86%	I hope you're right and Aedana magically stops being my problem.
%spread_louise_planetearth_87%	I can't imagine it happening, though.
%spread_louise_planetearth_88%	We'll have to wait and see.
%spread_louise_planetearth_89%	Don't fret, the deck is certain. You'll be off the hook, eventually.
%spread_louise_planetearth_94%	Take a large group of mortals to a magic domain and farm their energy there.
%spread_louise_planetearth_95%	What!? We're not talking about sheep here!
%spread_louise_planetearth_96%	The cards are providing the most effective solution.
%spread_louise_planetearth_97%	It's your call.
%spread_louise_planetearth_98%	But as I see it, you could save some of those people from their misery and take them to a beautiful place like the Pleasant Prairie.
%spread_louise_planetearth_99%	The cosmic unbalance will produce reality-altering entelechy, and they'll get to live in a paradise.
%spread_louise_planetearth_100%	Sounds like a win-win, when you put it like that...
%spread_louise_planetearth_101%	I'll think about it.
%spread_louise_planetearth_105%	That's if I ever need it to begin with.
%spread_louise_planetearth_106%	I sure hope I don't.
%spread_louise_planetearth_111%	Generate small conflicts instead of a total war.
%spread_louise_planetearth_112%	Urgh... It's better than world war, but I still can't feel good about it.
%spread_louise_planetearth_114%	If you want to comply with Aedana's orders, that's the most decent middle ground the cards have been able to find.
%spread_louise_planetearth_115%	I see...
%spread_louise_planetearth_118%	Luckily I won't have to deal with this anymore.
%spread_louise_planetearth_119%	Ah... Why did Aedana have to put me through this...
%spread_louise_planetearth_120%	It's too much for my heart.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_6%	Reveal your true nature to him. He will understand and love you even more.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_8%	What!? Really!?
%spread_louise_loveinterest_9%	So say the cards, and I've never seen them err.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_10%	By the cosmos, this is incredible news!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_11%	How should I go about it?
%spread_louise_loveinterest_12%	Tell him over a romantic dinner?
%spread_louise_loveinterest_13%	Should I surprise him with a colorful spell?
%spread_louise_loveinterest_14%	...In bed?
%spread_louise_loveinterest_15%	Hahaha. Whatever lets you enjoy the moment the most.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_17%	Thank you so much, Fortuna!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_22%	Move to Earth, set up your home there, and invite the mortal to live with you. Then slowly open up to him.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_23%	Mmm... that sounds like a nice way to reduce the shock.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_25%	And the idea of the two of us living together sounds quite nice, to be honest.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_27%	This is a beautiful solution, thank you so much Fortuna.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_28%	Don't take too much time, though! Mortals are not eternal!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_29%	Ok, ok. I'll make it quick. Two years max.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_30%	Sounds like a plan.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_31%	Can't wait to set up shop on Earth!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_36%	Kidnap him and make him live in your domain.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_38%	Fortuna!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_39%	I can't do that!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_40%	Mortals are extremely gullible. Just feed him whatever story and he will happily become your sex slave.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_41%	Fortuna!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_43%	FORTUNA!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_44%	The cards just look out for your best interests.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_45%	I'm sure he'll enjoy the privilege of leaving the broken Earth and enjoy living with you.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_46%	Still, kidnapping him sounds too aggressive!
%spread_louise_loveinterest_47%	Seduce him into it, then. Again, mortals are easy.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_49%	Ah... I really don't think you get it.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_50%	But I'll give it some thought.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_51%	If this is what the cards suggest, there must be some good in it...
%spread_louise_loveinterest_52%	I hope.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_57%	Leave him be and cut all ties, or it'll be more painful for the both of you in the future.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_58%	Oh...
%spread_louise_loveinterest_59%	Tough, but it makes sense.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_60%	It is something that's been in the back of my mind all these years.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_61%	So I guess it's time to Witch up to my responsibilities.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_62%	I'm sorry.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_63%	It's alright. This was just the push I needed to do the right thing.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_64%	I can't burden him with loving a Witch.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_65%	He needs to experience love with someone at his cosmic scale.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_66%	Sounds like a wise decision.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_67%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_72%	He doesn't love you. He's just taking advantage of you because you provide for him.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_73%	What!?
%spread_louise_loveinterest_74%	Ah...
%spread_louise_loveinterest_75%	We've been using each other all this time, then.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_76%	Serves me right for becoming infatuated with a mortal.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_77%	What do you plan to do now?
%spread_louise_loveinterest_78%	It pains me to know he doesn't love me.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_79%	But I still love him, and he won't live forever, anyway...
%spread_louise_loveinterest_80%	So I'll keep up this fake affair while it still brings pleasure to the both of us.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_81%	Mortals often aren't good news.
%spread_louise_loveinterest_82%	I'm sorry.
%spread_louise_aedana_6%	Stand up to Aedana. Rebellion will bring you real happiness no matter the cost.
%spread_louise_aedana_8%	Re-re-rebellion...!?
%spread_louise_aedana_9%	You may be punished, you may be expelled, you may even come out unscathed.
%spread_louise_aedana_10%	But what my deck knows for sure is that standing up to her will lead you to happiness.
%spread_louise_aedana_11%	It'll let you escape this obnoxious situation, for sure.
%spread_louise_aedana_12%	And you will be able to start a new chapter of your life.
%spread_louise_aedana_14%	When you put it like that... I feel silly for not having done it earlier.
%spread_louise_aedana_15%	You're right, Fortuna.
%spread_louise_aedana_16%	My principles are more important than satisfying anyone, even our leader.
%spread_louise_aedana_17%	I'll let Aedana know that I'm done with this project.
%spread_louise_aedana_18%	That's great. I've got your back, let me know if I can help you in any way.
%spread_louise_aedana_19%	You already did.
%spread_louise_aedana_20%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_louise_aedana_25%	Open up to Aedana. She will be surprisingly understanding and work with you to find the middle ground.
%spread_louise_aedana_26%	You think so?
%spread_louise_aedana_27%	I'm as surprised as you, knowing Aedana's character.
%spread_louise_aedana_28%	But the deck is certain of it, and I've never seen it fail.
%spread_louise_aedana_29%	Wow. It's definitely surprising, but it's good news.
%spread_louise_aedana_30%	I should have put more trust in our leader's judgment.
%spread_louise_aedana_31%	I'll speak with her, and I'll let you know how it goes.
%spread_louise_aedana_32%	I wish you the best.
%spread_louise_aedana_37%	Feed Aedana some lies, and, in time, she'll give up and focus elsewhere.
%spread_louise_aedana_38%	Whoa, that's pretty sleazy.
%spread_louise_aedana_39%	I don't feel very comfortable with this solution.
%spread_louise_aedana_40%	You can try and face Aedana directly if that makes you feel at peace with your principles.
%spread_louise_aedana_41%	But I'd follow the deck's advice. It's offering the path of least resistance.
%spread_louise_aedana_42%	Aedana is being unjust, forcing you to produce results by provoking wars.
%spread_louise_aedana_43%	As I see it, it'll be in everyone's best interest, including earthlings, to defuse Aedana by letting her interest peter out.
%spread_louise_aedana_44%	Hmm... you've got a point, there.
%spread_louise_aedana_45%	This isn't just about me. I must do anything in my power to save those poor souls.
%spread_louise_aedana_46%	If the price is telling some white lies, so be it.
%spread_louise_aedana_51%	Aedana won't ever be satisfied. You need to flee and find protection in another coven.
%spread_louise_aedana_52%	So that's it, huh...
%spread_louise_aedana_53%	Not even a seer can find a future for me in this coven.
%spread_louise_aedana_54%	Maybe you can come back if Aedana ever leaves power.
%spread_louise_aedana_55%	Ha, that could take eons.
%spread_louise_aedana_56%	It's alright. I'd rather change covens than hurt any more mortals.
%spread_louise_aedana_57%	I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help.
%spread_louise_aedana_58%	Oh, no, no. Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_louise_aedana_59%	You helped make up my mind. I was utterly lost.
%spread_louise_aedana_60%	But knowing this, I can take the reins of my life again.
%spread_louise_aedana_61%	That's good.
%spread_louise_aedana_66%	If you don't show even a bit of progress, she will punish you. Do what you can, no matter how long it takes.
%spread_louise_aedana_67%	There's no escaping Aedana's rule, huh...
%spread_louise_aedana_68%	I wouldn't be trapped on this asteroid, otherwise...
%spread_louise_aedana_69%	She's become too powerful.
%spread_louise_aedana_70%	If you don't want to put up with an excessive punishment, you'd better show some results.
%spread_louise_aedana_75%	Fake it if necessary.
%spread_louise_aedana_76%	Ah... what am I gonna do...
%spread_louise_aedana_77%	Maybe the cards will find a solution, we haven't checked the reading on Earth yet.
%spread_louise_aedana_78%	Fingers crossed.
%spread_louise_aedana_81%	We discovered there are alternatives to war to gather the energy you need.
%spread_louise_aedana_82%	Put more effort into that, instead of finding a way to elude Aedana.
%spread_louise_aedana_83%	You're right, I can do this.
%spread_louise_aedana_84%	Thank you.
%spread_louise_aedana_87%	Well in that case I am screwed.
%spread_louise_aedana_88%	Earth won't give me the energy I need.
%spread_louise_aedana_89%	And my next project review is in a couple of months.
%spread_louise_aedana_90%	If you need to, you should fake it until you find an alternative source for that kind of entelechy.
%spread_louise_aedana_91%	Not my favorite approach, but I'm out of ideas at this point...
%spread_louise_aedana_92%	Thank you.
%spread_louise_aedana_95%	If you put that mortal farm idea in practice you should be fine, though.
%spread_louise_aedana_97%	Please, stop saying "farm" and "farming mortals."
%spread_louise_aedana_98%	I'm going to create a shelter for earthlings in distress.
%spread_louise_aedana_100%	Of course, I'm sorry.
%spread_louise_aedana_101%	This is happening, then, huh...
%spread_louise_aedana_104%	So there's no way around it in the end, huh...
%spread_louise_aedana_105%	I guess I'll have to go with your idea of creating small scale conflicts.
%spread_louise_aedana_106%	It wasn't my idea. These are the cards speaking.
%spread_louise_aedana_107%	Of course, sorry.
%spread_louise_aedana_108%	Now to figure out a way to beg Aedana for more time.
%spread_louise_aedana_109%	Progress in progress. You won't be punished as long as you keep moving forward.
%spread_louise_aedana_110%	Understood.
%spread_louise_aedana_115%	Don't worry, something will happen very soon that'll stop Aedana from being your problem.
%spread_louise_aedana_116%	What!? Really?
%spread_louise_aedana_117%	The cards have spoken. I can't tell what's in store, but you don't need to do anything else.
%spread_louise_aedana_118%	I'm actually excited about this. I hope it means good news for me too, haha.
%spread_louise_aedana_119%	Oh my, I hope that's true!
%spread_louise_aedana_120%	Aedana has become a nuisance for many of us.
%spread_louise_aedana_121%	This could be great news for everyone...
%spread_louise_aedana_122%	...I hope!
%spread_louise_aedana_123%	Let's pray to the stars.
%spread_louise_aedana_131%	What am I supposed to do about Earth now, then?
%spread_louise_aedana_132%	Whatever you want. Should you want to exploit it, the deck offered you a way.
%spread_louise_aedana_133%	But no one will force you to do it.
%spread_louise_aedana_134%	Ok, ok. Nice.
%spread_louise_aedana_137%	So I won't need to cause any conflicts in the end!?
%spread_louise_aedana_140%	It makes sense that the cards said I won't be exploiting Earth.
%spread_louise_aedana_141%	Ah... That's a load off my mind.
%spread_louise_aedana_142%	Thank you so much, Fortuna.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_6%	Form a pact with benign deities so they move to Earth and bless mortals' lives.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_8%	Whoa! That is wild!
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_9%	Earth's fate is going to have a hard time trying to fix that.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_10%	The reality-altering entelechy is going to overflow from the planet.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_11%	I love it!
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_12%	If you're going to solve things as a Witch you should own it, Louise.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_13%	This universe is big, but thought can be even bigger.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_14%	My mentor always said that there are endless solutions to a problem.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_15%	And it is us Witches, more than anyone, who should entertain as many as possible.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_16%	That is a valuable lesson indeed.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_17%	I'll treasure it. Thank your mentor for me.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_18%	And thank you and your wonderful deck for the solution.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_19%	Our pleasure.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_24%	Enchant a book to become extremely popular among earthlings and make them want to change their ways.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_29%	Add an inhabitable moon to the Earth, ripe with resources, and give mortals an easy way to reach it.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_34%	Grant special magical abilities to some mortals and turn them into saints, able to cast miracles on their people.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_39%	Direct a menace from outer space to the Earth and help them to fend it off.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_40%	It is another form of war, but it'll create a greater peace among earthlings since they'll have to unite against a common threat.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_41%	And it'll sure disrupt their entelechy.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_42%	Whoa, that's Machiavellian.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_43%	So not even the deck can figure out how to avoid violent conflict...
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_44%	But it sure beats World War III.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_46%	Alright, I'll give it a try.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_49%	Luckily I won't have to deal with this anymore.
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_50%	Ah... Why did Aedana have to put me through this...
%spread_louise_distruptiveideas_51%	It's too much for my heart.
%spread_louise_followup_4%	Phew... that was an intense session.
%spread_louise_followup_5%	I've had my fortune read before, but it's never felt like this.
%spread_louise_followup_8%	You sure are something else, Fortuna.
%spread_louise_followup_9%	I'm just happy to help.
%spread_louise_followup_10%	I'll let you know how everything plays out.
%spread_louise_followup_12%	That's if you're ok with me visiting again, of course.
%spread_louise_followup_13%	You are always welcome in my house, Louise.
%spread_louise_followup_14%	Any friend of Jasmine's is a friend of mine.
%spread_louise_followup_16%	Likewise.
%spread_louise_followup_17%	Well, I'm a bit drained after so much divination.
%spread_louise_followup_18%	See you soon!
%spread_louise_followup_23%	I was so worried about this guy.
%spread_louise_followup_24%	You really helped me to put my thoughts in order.
%spread_louise_followup_25%	Thank you.
%spread_louise_followup_26%	Are you sure you don't want to look into how to deal with Aedana?
%spread_louise_followup_27%	No, no. That's alright.
%spread_louise_followup_29%	In fact, I should be leaving now.
%spread_louise_followup_30%	So soon?
%spread_louise_followup_32%	Ah, yeah... I'm so sorry...
%spread_louise_followup_33%	I...
%spread_louise_followup_34%	I have to go. I forgot I'm meeting someone else halfway across the galaxy.
%spread_louise_followup_35%	Uh... sure.
%spread_louise_followup_36%	Safe travels.
%spread_louise_followup_37%	Goodbye!
%louise_jas_followup_war_3%	Welcome!
%louise_jas_followup_war_4%	Is it true?
%louise_jas_followup_war_5%	Did you offer to help Louise start World War III?
%louise_jas_followup_war_8%	Yes. What about it?
%louise_jas_followup_war_9%	It was on Aedana's orders!
%louise_jas_followup_war_10%	I am truly sorry. Please, forgive me.
%louise_jas_followup_war_14%	Yes. What about it?
%louise_jas_followup_war_15%	Fortuna! We're talking about millions of lives here!
%louise_jas_followup_war_16%	What does it matter? Mortals will be dead soon enough, anyway.
%louise_jas_followup_war_18%	Oh, no... what are you saying...
%louise_jas_followup_war_19%	I need to talk to Aedana, this exile isn't doing you any good.
%louise_jas_followup_war_20%	I don't think that's a good idea.
%louise_jas_followup_war_21%	I mean, I'm all up for you standing up to Aedana.
%louise_jas_followup_war_22%	But this is all because of our leader in the first place.
%louise_jas_followup_war_23%	Aedana is the one who tasked Louise with spreading total war on Earth.
%louise_jas_followup_war_24%	Oh, no...
%louise_jas_followup_war_25%	I was just acting in the best interests of the coven.
%louise_jas_followup_war_26%	Mmm...
%louise_jas_followup_war_27%	Maybe Louise overreacted a bit.
%louise_jas_followup_war_28%	You were just trying to facilitate her mission.
%louise_jas_followup_war_29%	And I'm sure our leader, in all her wisdom, has good reasons for taking these actions.
%louise_jas_followup_war_31%	But I'm not too fond of that disregard of mortal lives, Fortuna.
%louise_jas_followup_war_33%	You weren't like this before. What is going on?
%louise_jas_followup_war_35%	Ah...
%louise_jas_followup_war_36%	I guess isolation isn't doing me any favors.
%louise_jas_followup_war_37%	I'm losing touch with reality, especially mortal existence.
%louise_jas_followup_war_38%	I spent centuries here just watching the stars burn away.
%louise_jas_followup_war_39%	We need to take you out for a stroll.
%louise_jas_followup_war_40%	Smell the flowers again, pet a cat, watch some children play in a river.
%louise_jas_followup_war_41%	I'd say that's the best medicine for your case.
%louise_jas_followup_war_42%	Just eight hundred years to go, huh?
%louise_jas_followup_war_44%	Fortuna...
%louise_jas_followup_war_45%	It's alright. I'm doing a lot better just from being able to talk to other Witches.
%louise_jas_followup_war_46%	And...
%louise_jas_followup_war_47%	Thank you for reprimanding me.
%louise_jas_followup_war_49%	Whoa, you've never thanked me for scolding you.
%louise_jas_followup_war_50%	You truly need some love, poor thing.
%louise_jas_followup_war_51%	Can you tell Louise I'm sorry?
%louise_jas_followup_war_54%	I will.
%louise_jas_followup_war_55%	I mean, she got anxious given the prospect of causing a world war.
%louise_jas_followup_war_56%	But mostly she pitied you. She could "perceive how broken you were."
%louise_jas_followup_war_57%	Her words, not mine.
%louise_jas_followup_war_58%	Agh...
%louise_jas_followup_war_59%	I understand.
%louise_jas_followup_war_61%	I'm going to leave now, but I'm going to think long and hard about some ways to improve your life here.
%louise_jas_followup_war_62%	Thank you, Jasmine.
%louise_jas_followup_war_66%	I will, but she's scared shitless of you.
%louise_jas_followup_war_67%	Louise is very sensitive to people's auras, because of her Pithweaving skills.
%louise_jas_followup_war_68%	We need to take good care of you. It's not healthy to be this sour.
%louise_jas_followup_war_69%	I know...
%louise_jas_followup_war_72%	"Never meet your heroes."
%louise_jas_followup_war_73%	That's what she said to me.
%louise_jas_followup_war_74%	I'm sure she'll accept your apologies, but I wouldn't count on her coming back here anytime soon.
%louise_jas_followup_war_75%	Oh... I see. I'm sorry.
%louise_jas_followup_war_76%	Even so, Louise was amazed by your presence and divination skills.
%louise_jas_followup_war_77%	She confided in me that she believes you may eventually surpass Aedana.
%louise_jas_followup_war_78%	Ah... I feel really bad now.
%louise_jas_followup_war_82%	It was on Aedana's orders!
%louise_jas_followup_war_83%	I didn't want anyone else to suffer the same fate as me.
%louise_jas_followup_war_84%	It's too dangerous to cross Aedana.
%louise_jas_followup_war_86%	Ah, Fortuna...
%louise_jas_followup_war_87%	I understand. I wouldn't dare go against our leader's judgment.
%louise_jas_followup_war_88%	She knows better than us.
%louise_jas_followup_war_89%	But your way of tackling the issue didn't come off right to Louise.
%louise_jas_followup_war_90%	She should have been more clear about her desires.
%louise_jas_followup_war_91%	You can't ask someone who's lived isolated for two hundred years to read people's subtleties!
%louise_jas_followup_war_93%	I know, I know.
%louise_jas_followup_war_94%	I'm sorry.
%louise_jas_followup_war_95%	I just wanted to hear your side of the story.
%louise_jas_followup_war_96%	I'm here to help. I will always be on your side. You know that, right?
%louise_jas_followup_war_97%	Thank you...
%louise_jas_followup_war_101%	I am truly sorry. Please, forgive me.
%louise_jas_followup_war_103%	Ah, Fortuna...
%louise_jas_followup_war_104%	Sweet thing. I knew you didn't mean any harm.
%louise_jas_followup_war_105%	Why did you do it?
%louise_jas_followup_war_106%	I don't know.
%louise_jas_followup_war_107%	I guess I'm so traumatized by Aedana that I don't want any other Witch to suffer, no matter the cost.
%louise_jas_followup_war_108%	I understand.
%louise_jas_followup_war_110%	I've always trusted Aedana's judgment, given her godly intellect...
%louise_jas_followup_war_111%	But this is making it really hard for me to follow her blindly.
%louise_jas_followup_war_112%	I don't think I'll ever be able to trust her again, to be honest.
%louise_jas_followup_war_113%	That is completely understandable.
%louise_jas_followup_war_115%	...
%louise_jas_followup_war_116%	If anything happens, I will always be on your side. You know that, right?
%louise_jas_followup_war_117%	Thank you...
%louise_jas_followup_war_118%	But please, don't ever consider mass murder again, ok?
%louise_jas_followup_flee_3%	Fortuna!
%louise_jas_followup_flee_4%	Louise just came by before I left home to visit you.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_5%	She's leaving for good!
%louise_jas_followup_flee_6%	Why did you tell her to leave?
%louise_jas_followup_flee_7%	I'm sure we could have sorted out things with Aedana...
%louise_jas_followup_flee_8%	Ah... welcome, Jasmine.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_9%	First of all, I didn't tell her to leave.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_10%	It was the deck that suggested she should go, to avoid a major tragedy.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_11%	The situation with Aedana wasn't going to end well.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_12%	And I am a living witness of how sour things can turn when dealing with our leader.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_13%	And secondly:
%louise_jas_followup_flee_17%	No matter how creative a solution Louise tried, the deck was certain Aedana would make her life impossible.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_20%	It was either that or causing World War III on Earth. You tell me which you would prefer.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_23%	It was either that or starting farms of mortals, and even then, it wasn't guaranteed that Aedana would be satisfied.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_26%	It was either that or spreading war on Earth, and Louise was totally against it.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_29%	It was checkmate for our friend.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_30%	She had to escape.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_31%	I see...
%louise_jas_followup_flee_33%	I can't believe Aedana caused a precious member of our community so much distress that she was forced to leave.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_34%	Our leader's ambition is out of place.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_35%	Whoa, Jasmine's talking the revolutionary talk.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_37%	Ah! No, no!
%louise_jas_followup_flee_38%	I shouldn't doubt Aedana's judgment.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_39%	She's the one able to speak with the gods, after all.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_41%	There must be a cosmic plan to all this.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_42%	Some gods they are...
%louise_jas_followup_flee_44%	Fortuna!
%louise_jas_followup_flee_45%	Anyway, how was Louise?
%louise_jas_followup_flee_46%	Where is she going? Did she manage to leave unnoticed?
%louise_jas_followup_flee_48%	Yes. She doesn't have a project review for another couple of months.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_49%	So she just packed all her stuff, discreetly.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_55%	She didn't tell me where she plans to go, but she said she'll contact us when it feels safe.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_58%	She is setting up shop on Earth. Moving in with her lover.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_59%	Good for her!
%louise_jas_followup_flee_60%	She's putting all her trust in your cards.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_61%	She'll be alright, then.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_64%	When she visited my garden, she was accompanied by a mortal. Her lover, I believe.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_65%	I'm not sure if he's doing it willingly. The guy seemed to be in shock.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_66%	So she's really done it. Good for her.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_67%	So this was your deck's doing too, mmm?
%louise_jas_followup_flee_68%	Ah... yes.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_71%	Cut all ties with her mortal acquaintances and left.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_74%	Also, Louise wanted me to thank you for your help.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_75%	She seemed happy to break away from Aedana, in the end...
%louise_jas_followup_flee_76%	She's sorry she couldn't come to say goodbye in person. She used all her time weaving something for you.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_77%	It's a Pithcloth.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_80%	She told me she harvested the thread from a space station!
%louise_jas_followup_flee_83%	She told me she collected the energy from a family's weekend trip.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_86%	She had a surplus of war energy from the experiments she did for Aedana.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_88%	Here.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_2%	Oh, it is beautiful.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_3%	I humbly accept it.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_5%	Louise is great, right?
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_7%	I'm going to miss her...
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_9%	Thank you so much for helping her, Fortuna.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_10%	I guess that the coven doesn't mean anything if its Witches aren't happy.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_11%	Tell me about it.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_12%	Ah... I'm sorry.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_13%	We need to take you out for a stroll.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_14%	Smell the flowers again, pet a cat, watch some children play in a river.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_15%	I'd say that's the best medicine for your case.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_16%	Just eight hundred years to go, huh?
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_18%	Fortuna...
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_19%	It's alright. I'm doing a lot better just from being able to talk to other Witches.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_21%	Look, I'm going to leave now, but I'm going to think long and hard about some ways to improve your life here.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_22%	Thank you, Jasmine.
%louise_jas_followup_flee_2_23%	Take care, and thanks again for helping Louise!
%louise_jas_followup_2%	Hello, Fortuna! How are you doing?
%louise_jas_followup_3%	Fine, I guess.
%louise_jas_followup_4%	Happy to see you.
%louise_jas_followup_6%	Aaah... It feels so good to be able to meet again like this!
%louise_jas_followup_7%	I only wish I could get to see your garden again.
%louise_jas_followup_8%	It must be beautiful after all this time.
%louise_jas_followup_10%	I'm pretty proud of it, hehe.
%louise_jas_followup_11%	In due time, I'll be happy to show you everything!
%louise_jas_followup_12%	Until then, I brought you this:
%louise_jas_followup_2_3%	It's a Blue Iris.
%louise_jas_followup_2_4%	This is beautiful! Thank you!
%louise_jas_followup_2_5%	This flower is a bringer of hope.
%louise_jas_followup_2_6%	A charm for faith, wisdom, and understanding.
%louise_jas_followup_2_8%	I thought it'd improve the energy of the room and help you with your fortune telling.
%louise_jas_followup_2_9%	I love it, thank you so much.
%louise_jas_followup_2_11%	So... Louise came to visit you.
%louise_jas_followup_2_12%	That's right.
%louise_jas_followup_2_14%	I'm so sorry, I should have consulted with you before telling anyone.
%louise_jas_followup_2_15%	I just wanted to share the joy of having my friend back.
%louise_jas_followup_2_16%	I didn't expect her to come and see you out of the blue!
%louise_jas_followup_2_17%	It's alright, don't worry about it.
%louise_jas_followup_2_18%	She seems like a nice girl.
%louise_jas_followup_2_20%	She is a very gentle soul.
%louise_jas_followup_2_21%	I hope you were able to help her.
%louise_jas_followup_2_22%	She's in a pretty delicate situation, to be honest.
%louise_jas_followup_2_23%	Oh, is she in trouble? What's going on with Louise?
%louise_jas_followup_2_26%	I shouldn't disclose any consultation...
%louise_jas_followup_2_27%	Aedana is forcing her to start war on Earth.
%louise_jas_followup_2_31%	I shouldn't disclose any consultation...
%louise_jas_followup_2_33%	Oh! I'm so sorry.
%louise_jas_followup_2_34%	You should ask her yourself.
%louise_jas_followup_2_35%	If she's alright with sharing I'll be happy to tell you more about it!
%louise_jas_followup_2_37%	You are absolutely right.
%louise_jas_followup_2_38%	I'll pay her a visit and see what is going on. She seems a bit stressed lately.
%louise_jas_followup_2_39%	She could use the help, yes.
%louise_jas_followup_2_40%	In fact, I'm gonna head to her place now.
%louise_jas_followup_2_41%	Do you need anything?
%louise_jas_followup_2_42%	It's alright, go.
%louise_jas_followup_2_43%	Bye bye!
%louise_jas_followup_2_48%	Aedana is forcing her to start war on Earth.
%louise_jas_followup_2_50%	Come again!?
%louise_jas_followup_2_51%	They found a way to harvest a powerful energy to create weapons against Behemoths.
%louise_jas_followup_2_52%	And the fastest way to produce this energy seems to be spreading war among mortals.
%louise_jas_followup_2_54%	This is terrible.
%louise_jas_followup_2_55%	I've always trusted Aedana's judgment, given her godly intellect...
%louise_jas_followup_2_56%	But this is making it really hard for me to follow her blindly.
%louise_jas_followup_2_57%	I don't think I'll ever be able to trust our leader again, to be honest.
%louise_jas_followup_2_58%	That is completely understandable.
%louise_jas_followup_2_60%	...
%louise_jas_followup_2_61%	If anything happens, I will always be on your side. You know that, right?
%louise_jas_followup_2_62%	Thank you...
%louise_jas_followup_2_63%	Ah... Louise must be having a hard time. I should check up on her.
%louise_jas_followup_2_64%	Sure, don't worry about me. Go.
%louise_jas_followup_2_66%	Thank you so much for helping my friend, Fortuna.
%louise_jas_followup_2_67%	See you soon!
%louise_aftermath_2%	Thank you for having me.
%louise_aftermath_3%	Hello, Louise.
%louise_aftermath_4%	So, how did it go?
%louise_aftermath_13%	I...
%louise_aftermath_15%	I did it, Fortuna!
%louise_aftermath_16%	I stood up to Aedana and it felt amazing!
%louise_aftermath_17%	It was really scary, too, and I've been condemned to fifty years of forced labor.
%louise_aftermath_19%	But now I don't have to exploit mortals any more!
%louise_aftermath_20%	Whoa, I'm sorry to hear you got punished that bad.
%louise_aftermath_21%	But you were right! I am utterly happy and relieved!
%louise_aftermath_22%	Plus the forced labor involves collecting materials for other Witches' projects.
%louise_aftermath_23%	I'm more than happy to do that instead of causing any wars.
%louise_aftermath_24%	Ah... That's good. I was expecting way worse from Aedana.
%louise_aftermath_25%	You should have more confidence in your cards.
%louise_aftermath_26%	They were absolutely right, my life is way better now!
%louise_aftermath_31%	You have given me the best possible advice.
%louise_aftermath_32%	It was just a matter of being more forthcoming and putting some trust in our leader.
%louise_aftermath_43%	At first she fought the idea of not exploiting the Earth.
%louise_aftermath_44%	But she ended up empathizing with my motives. She's given me ten years to find an alternative source of entelechy.
%louise_aftermath_45%	I shouldn't have demonized Aedana. She is a wise leader, after all.
%louise_aftermath_48%	She responded enthusiastically to the idea of "building human farms."
%louise_aftermath_49%	Again, I tried to reframe it as a refuge for the less fortunate.
%louise_aftermath_50%	She didn't care, as long as I develop a stable source of reality-altering entelechy, so...
%louise_aftermath_51%	I guess that all's well that ends well.
%louise_aftermath_55%	It wasn't easy to convince her to have more patience.
%louise_aftermath_56%	But in the end she took my feelings into account and allowed me to work with smaller conflicts instead of triggering a genocide...
%louise_aftermath_57%	It's not an ideal scenario, but I think I'll be able to sleep a bit better now...
%louise_aftermath_60%	It took some convincing to make Aedana forget about the easy way.
%louise_aftermath_61%	But in the end she acknowledged the elegance of summoning deities to alter the lives of mortals.
%louise_aftermath_62%	Just in case we need them alive for future projects...
%louise_aftermath_63%	Quite pragmatic, that Aedana.
%louise_aftermath_64%	Hey, as long as we can avoid war, she can think whatever she wants.
%louise_aftermath_67%	At first, she was against using the book idea to disrupt mortal society.
%louise_aftermath_68%	But when she rethought the possibilities of introducing new dogmas among the population, she liked it even more than starting any war.
%louise_aftermath_69%	So we did it. We avoided World War III.
%louise_aftermath_70%	Hahaha, what a surreal phrase to say.
%louise_aftermath_71%	Hahaha...
%louise_aftermath_74%	She wasn't very welcoming to the idea of creating a new moon.
%louise_aftermath_75%	Especially if you consider the costs of such a feat.
%louise_aftermath_76%	But when I reframed it as a display of power before the other covens she suddenly became quite enthusiastic.
%louise_aftermath_77%	What a pure heart.
%louise_aftermath_78%	Hey, all's well that ends well.
%louise_aftermath_81%	At first, she was against "creating saints" to disrupt mortal society.
%louise_aftermath_82%	But when she reconsidered the possibilities of manipulating humanity through our very own prophets, she liked the idea even more than starting any war.
%louise_aftermath_83%	So we did it. We avoided World War III.
%louise_aftermath_84%	Hahaha, what a surreal phrase to say.
%louise_aftermath_85%	Hahaha...
%louise_aftermath_88%	She didn't care whether war happened among earthlings or against an external threat as long as we disrupted their reality.
%louise_aftermath_89%	To me, this is way better. We can design a challenge that mortals can endure and make them unite in the process.
%louise_aftermath_90%	I'll do my best to minimize the terror.
%louise_aftermath_91%	I believe in you. You're a resourceful Witch, and you have many allies in the coven.
%louise_aftermath_92%	Yes, I know how fortunate I am in that regard.
%louise_aftermath_93%	Oh, by the way...
%louise_aftermath_97%	I visited Aedana and, ah...
%louise_aftermath_98%	I feel terrible, to be honest.
%louise_aftermath_99%	But apparently, she bought all my lies.
%louise_aftermath_100%	It doesn't make me feel super proud, but at least we're avoiding war on Earth.
%louise_aftermath_101%	So all's well that ends well, I guess.
%louise_aftermath_106%	I visited Aedana. It was a terrifying meeting.
%louise_aftermath_107%	She got very upset when I told her it'll take me more time than we agreed to achieve any results.
%louise_aftermath_108%	Then I talked her through the ideas I had to harvest energy.
%louise_aftermath_113%	You were right about Aedana.
%louise_aftermath_114%	I went to visit her and talk about an alternative source of energy for our project and...
%louise_aftermath_115%	She didn't seem to care much.
%louise_aftermath_116%	Something is amiss with our leader.
%louise_aftermath_117%	She felt... devoid of life.
%louise_aftermath_118%	I didn't dare ask about what was going on.
%louise_aftermath_119%	But I have a really bad feeling about this.
%louise_aftermath_120%	Turbulent times are coming.
%louise_aftermath_121%	Mmm...
%louise_aftermath_122%	That is quite disturbing, yes.
%louise_aftermath_123%	I'd explore what is going on with Aedana, but I doubt she'd agree to come here and have her fortune read.
%louise_aftermath_124%	And, on second thoughts, I wouldn't like for her to know I'm developing a new deck...
%louise_aftermath_125%	Better not to mess with Aedana, I agree.
%louise_aftermath_126%	Ah! By the way...
%louise_aftermath_137%	I also confessed my true nature to my mortal lover and...
%louise_aftermath_138%	It was perfect!
%louise_aftermath_140%	It feels so good to be able to love without putting on a mask!
%louise_aftermath_145%	I made up my mind. I'm moving to Earth.
%louise_aftermath_146%	I put some thought into what you told me and you're right.
%louise_aftermath_147%	It solves many problems... I'll get to be close to my love, I'll be able to slowly open up to him, plus I get to protect him.
%louise_aftermath_148%	I can't wait to start my new life with him.
%louise_aftermath_153%	I...
%louise_aftermath_155%	I kidnapped him, my mortal lover...
%louise_aftermath_156%	I still don't know how to feel about it. But you were right, it hasn't been that traumatic for him.
%louise_aftermath_157%	Told you. We Witches have a special influence over them.
%louise_aftermath_158%	I understand the moral quandaries around that, but...
%louise_aftermath_159%	You will never get to enjoy a relationship with a mortal without using it.
%louise_aftermath_160%	I guess you're right. He looks happy and excited exploring my domain.
%louise_aftermath_161%	You're a Witch, own it.
%louise_aftermath_163%	Alright.
%louise_aftermath_168%	I cut ties with my mortal lover.
%louise_aftermath_169%	It's been tough, but you were right.
%louise_aftermath_170%	This couldn't end well for either of us.
%louise_aftermath_175%	I decided to keep loving that mortal.
%louise_aftermath_176%	I don't mind if he thinks he's using me.
%louise_aftermath_177%	I'm using him too, in some sense.
%louise_aftermath_179%	...And no one said he should be my only lover.
%louise_aftermath_181%	But it feels good to be aware of the terms of our relationship.
%louise_aftermath_182%	He didn't have to say he loved me if he didn't want to.
%louise_aftermath_183%	Anyway...
%louise_aftermath_188%	In the end, I don't feel as liberated as I thought I would.
%louise_aftermath_189%	It's like my problems haven't been solved, just... rearranged.
%louise_aftermath_190%	But I guess you can't escape fate, eh?
%louise_aftermath_191%	I'm sorry, the Cosmos can be a bitch.
%louise_aftermath_192%	In any case, I brought you a present for having taken the time to hear my case.
%louise_aftermath_197%	You changed my life, Fortuna.
%louise_aftermath_198%	I got rid of some stupid shackles I had put on myself.
%louise_aftermath_199%	I'm so happy to hear that.
%louise_aftermath_200%	I was worried my deck would cause you trouble.
%louise_aftermath_202%	I brought you a present.
%louise_aftermath_204%	Oh! What is it?
%louise_aftermath_205%	It's a Pithcloth.
%louise_aftermath_209%	I harvested the thread from a space station!
%louise_aftermath_212%	I collected the energy from a family's weekend trip.
%louise_aftermath_215%	I had a surplus of war energy from the experiments I did for Aedana, so...
%louise_aftermath_217%	Here.
%louise_aftermath_2_2%	Oh, it is beautiful.
%louise_aftermath_2_3%	I humbly accept it.
%louise_aftermath_2_5%	It's the least I could do. Since you shared your arts with me, I wanted to do the same for you.
%louise_aftermath_2_6%	You needn't have, really, I'm just happy to help.
%louise_aftermath_2_7%	I like to maintain the cosmic balance, in any case.
%louise_aftermath_2_8%	Thank you.
%louise_aftermath_2_9%	Well, I should leave and deal with reality now.
%louise_aftermath_2_12%	It's but a token of my gratitude.
%louise_aftermath_2_14%	I hope one day I can truly repay you.
%louise_aftermath_2_15%	There is no need. This is more than enough.
%louise_aftermath_2_17%	Leaving courtesy aside, I'm serious. Let me know if you ever need my help.
%louise_aftermath_2_18%	Thank you, I will.
%louise_aftermath_2_20%	Take care, Fortuna.
%louise_aftermath_2_21%	Likewise.
%grethe_intro_2%	Welcome, Grethe.
%grethe_intro_3%	Hi, Fortuna. Thanks for having me.
%grethe_intro_4%	Dahlia filled me in briefly on your situation.
%grethe_intro_5%	Not that it isn't obvious just by looking at me, huh.
%grethe_intro_6%	Ah... yeah, it looks bad.
%grethe_intro_7%	Let me say it out loud anyway, for the sake of therapy.
%grethe_intro_8%	I've got a Behemoth fused with me.
%grethe_intro_9%	How does it feel?
%grethe_intro_10%	Whoa, never thought I'd get that question.
%grethe_intro_11%	The few who know assume it's just fucked up, I guess...
%grethe_intro_12%	But if we're talking feelings here... it doesn't feel bad at all, actually.
%grethe_intro_13%	I mean, aesthetically it's terrible.
%grethe_intro_14%	But it doesn't hurt, and I can sort of communicate with the Behemoth at an abstract level.
%grethe_intro_15%	If anything, I feel more powerful.
%grethe_intro_16%	Wow.
%grethe_intro_17%	Glad to hear you're not suffering, in any case.
%grethe_intro_18%	But it isn't worth it.
%grethe_intro_19%	Firstly because summoning a Behemoth could well get me executed.
%grethe_intro_20%	But more importantly, I want my cute cheekbone back.
%grethe_intro_21%	Looks like an important loss, yes.
%grethe_intro_22%	So, do you think you can help me?
%grethe_intro_23%	If there's a way to cure you, my deck will find it.
%grethe_intro_24%	But I need to know more about you first.
%grethe_intro_25%	Mind if I ask some questions?
%grethe_intro_26%	Of course.
%grethe_intro_33%	Ask away.
%grethe_intro_36%	Why summon a Behemoth?
%grethe_intro_37%	Tell me more about being a Witch Architect.
%grethe_intro_38%	What do you like to do in your free time?
%grethe_intro_39%	What are your thoughts on Aedana?
%grethe_intro_40%	I know enough, let's do a reading.
%grethe_intro_45%	Why summon a Behemoth?
%grethe_intro_46%	Ah... This isn't an easy topic for me to discuss.
%grethe_intro_47%	Not because of the Behemoth. That part is pretty straightforward.
%grethe_intro_48%	I wanted to build a temple out of the skull of a Titan of the Quarry.
%grethe_intro_49%	The harder the material, the more powerful the altar.
%grethe_intro_50%	And those skulls, they resist carving in a supernatural way.
%grethe_intro_51%	I tried every method I know, and when I ran out of options, I resorted to forbidden magic.
%grethe_intro_52%	Why are you so desperate to build that shrine?
%grethe_intro_53%	That's the sensitive issue.
%grethe_intro_54%	I'm looking for meaning.
%grethe_intro_55%	...meaning?
%grethe_intro_56%	I know it's an unanswerable question.
%grethe_intro_57%	Or a question that hasn't been answered yet, if I want to put this optimistically.
%grethe_intro_58%	The meaning of life.
%grethe_intro_59%	Ah... I feel silly just saying it out loud.
%grethe_intro_62%	Why? Everyone thinks about it now and then.
%grethe_intro_63%	I don't think life is supposed to have a meaning.
%grethe_intro_67%	Why? Everyone thinks about it now and then.
%grethe_intro_68%	Yeah, but I'm like... obsessed with it.
%grethe_intro_72%	I don't think life is supposed to have a meaning.
%grethe_intro_73%	I know. That's the healthiest attitude to have towards the cosmos.
%grethe_intro_74%	But I'm obsessed.
%grethe_intro_76%	I can't ignore the question.
%grethe_intro_77%	You're a fortune teller.
%grethe_intro_78%	You should be aware that there is something more out there.
%grethe_intro_79%	The book where everything is written.
%grethe_intro_81%	Is there someone writing us?
%grethe_intro_82%	Is this just a simulation?
%grethe_intro_83%	Does the universe actually exist? Or is it nothing but a figment of my imagination?
%grethe_intro_84%	Do you stop existing when I'm not looking at you?
%grethe_intro_85%	Are we all protagonists?
%grethe_intro_86%	Do we have a purpose?
%grethe_intro_87%	Ok, ok, I get you.
%grethe_intro_88%	Am I missing out on some cosmic truth?
%grethe_intro_89%	Was there something before this universe?
%grethe_intro_90%	Why isn't everybody else obsessed with these same questions?
%grethe_intro_91%	Grethe.
%grethe_intro_93%	Ah... I'm sorry. I keep spiraling out of control.
%grethe_intro_94%	I can't stand being by myself because I keep returning to these ideas again and again.
%grethe_intro_95%	I've built countless thought shrines, looking for answers.
%grethe_intro_96%	And as I dig deeper, I only find more and more questions.
%grethe_intro_97%	I haven't slept in the last century.
%grethe_intro_98%	That's why I summoned the Behemoth.
%grethe_intro_99%	"Carpe diem" is not an option for me. I'm stuck in "Cogito ergo sum."
%grethe_intro_100%	I'm a Witch, for fuck's sake.
%grethe_intro_101%	If not us, who is supposed to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos?
%grethe_intro_102%	Why did I ascend? Why couldn't I stay an oblivious Boston architect?
%grethe_intro_103%	You know, the cards aren't only made for predicting things.
%grethe_intro_104%	They are also an excellent tool for meditation.
%grethe_intro_105%	I'd be happy to help you on your quest.
%grethe_intro_106%	Really?
%grethe_intro_107%	Of course.
%grethe_intro_108%	If the two of us manage to get out of our... predicaments, I'll certainly join you on one of your skull temple meditations.
%grethe_intro_109%	Who knows what we might find channeling the power of your shrines through my deck.
%grethe_intro_111%	That makes my heart race.
%grethe_intro_112%	Yes, please. Let's dissect the cosmos together.
%grethe_intro_113%	What's your predicament, though?
%grethe_intro_114%	Ah... I'm exiled. Forced to remain on this asteroid.
%grethe_intro_115%	Let's leave it at that, for now.
%grethe_intro_117%	Hmm... ok.
%grethe_intro_118%	I promise I'll help you be free in any way I can.
%grethe_intro_119%	Partners?
%grethe_intro_122%	Partners.
%grethe_intro_123%	Let's focus on your case, first.
%grethe_intro_127%	Partners.
%grethe_intro_129%	Partners!
%grethe_intro_130%	How exciting!
%grethe_intro_131%	Everyone always dismisses my project as futile.
%grethe_intro_132%	Thank you so much, Fortuna.
%grethe_intro_137%	Let's focus on your case, first.
%grethe_intro_138%	Ah, absolutely.
%grethe_intro_139%	I can't help getting ahead of myself whenever I find a new lead.
%grethe_intro_140%	Haha, it's alright.
%grethe_intro_147%	Now, another question...
%grethe_intro_149%	Why summon a Behemoth?
%grethe_intro_150%	Tell me more about being a Witch Architect.
%grethe_intro_151%	What do you like to do in your free time?
%grethe_intro_152%	What are your thoughts on Aedana?
%grethe_intro_157%	Wait, wait, wait.
%grethe_intro_158%	What do you say we make this a conversation instead of an interrogation.
%grethe_intro_159%	It's not an interrogation, it's an interview.
%grethe_intro_160%	And besides, I'm not that interesting.
%grethe_intro_161%	Come on, Fortuna. All Witches are interesting.
%grethe_intro_162%	And you're the only fortune teller in our coven.
%grethe_intro_163%	Dahlia speaks highly of you, too.
%grethe_intro_164%	I'm dying to know more.
%grethe_intro_167%	You have this special aura that makes me want to protect you.
%grethe_intro_168%	You are adorable.
%grethe_intro_171%	You have this special aura that makes me feel challenged.
%grethe_intro_172%	You're so intimidating. The adrenaline is making me feel alive just being in your presence.
%grethe_intro_175%	To be honest, I feel awestruck just by the way you look at me.
%grethe_intro_176%	I can tell you aren't cut from the same cloth as the rest of us. You are special.
%grethe_intro_177%	I've never said this to anyone. I feel ridiculous, but I just... need to express it.
%grethe_intro_179%	Ah...haha, thanks?
%grethe_intro_180%	What do you want to know, anyway?
%grethe_intro_181%	Mmm...
%grethe_intro_182%	What is it that drives you?
%grethe_intro_183%	Freedom.
%grethe_intro_184%	Mmm... but that's circumstantial.
%grethe_intro_185%	I mean ultimately. What makes your life worth living?
%grethe_intro_186%	What is it that drives you?
%grethe_intro_189%	Pleasure.
%grethe_intro_190%	Curiosity.
%grethe_intro_191%	Achievements.
%grethe_intro_195%	Pleasure.
%grethe_intro_196%	Oh, I'd never have guessed that. You don't strike me as a hedonist.
%grethe_intro_200%	Curiosity.
%grethe_intro_201%	Curiosity! I'd say that's my raison d'etre, too!
%grethe_intro_205%	Achievements.
%grethe_intro_206%	Oh, so that's where your intensity comes from...
%grethe_intro_211%	Interesting...
%grethe_intro_212%	I feel like you're using me for your cosmic studies...
%grethe_intro_214%	Haha, well, I can't miss the chance to pick apart such a wonderful being.
%grethe_intro_217%	You're weird...
%grethe_intro_218%	You truly are obsessed.
%grethe_intro_219%	It's alright, bring it on.
%grethe_intro_223%	You're weird...
%grethe_intro_224%	I get that a lot.
%grethe_intro_225%	Can't help it, though.
%grethe_intro_226%	I swore to myself I would never let etiquette keep me from what I crave.
%grethe_intro_227%	I had too much of that back when I was a mortal.
%grethe_intro_228%	We Witches shouldn't care for appearances.
%grethe_intro_229%	Ok, your turn now.
%grethe_intro_233%	You truly are obsessed.
%grethe_intro_234%	I told you. I didn't say that lightly.
%grethe_intro_235%	I wish I could switch gears, but my mind always swims in the same direction.
%grethe_intro_236%	It's good to be passionate about something, I guess.
%grethe_intro_237%	Provided it doesn't drive you mad...
%grethe_intro_238%	Anyway, your turn now.
%grethe_intro_242%	It's alright, bring it on.
%grethe_intro_243%	Ah, thank you so much for indulging me.
%grethe_intro_244%	I am truly enjoying this, though.
%grethe_intro_245%	Glad you're having a good time, haha.
%grethe_intro_246%	My turn now?
%grethe_intro_247%	Sure.
%grethe_intro_252%	Tell me more about being a Witch Architect.
%grethe_intro_253%	It's a made up title, to be honest.
%grethe_intro_254%	I've never encountered another Witch who defined herself as an Architect, at least.
%grethe_intro_255%	A pioneer, then.
%grethe_intro_256%	I just like to build things.
%grethe_intro_257%	I was also an architect when I was a mortal.
%grethe_intro_258%	But being able to design and execute projects by yourself is way better than overseeing years of development.
%grethe_intro_259%	And all the bureaucracy, ugh.
%grethe_intro_260%	I'm sure that I ascended out of pure stress, haha.
%grethe_intro_261%	Plus using magic to avoid having to deal with the laws of physics sure is a perk.
%grethe_intro_262%	Sounds like a pain, building things on Earth.
%grethe_intro_263%	You bet. I was one of those people who preferred playing Minecraft in creative mode.
%grethe_intro_264%	Minecraft?
%grethe_intro_265%	Ah, that may have come after your time.
%grethe_intro_266%	You come from Earth too, right? When did you ascend?
%grethe_intro_267%	1968.
%grethe_intro_268%	Whoa. I was born in the year 2000, and ascended in 2032.
%grethe_intro_269%	Were you a hippie?
%grethe_intro_270%	Not really, but I met a lot of them.
%grethe_intro_272%	I owned a food truck and visited a lot of events.
%grethe_intro_273%	Had a side business reading Tarot, too.
%grethe_intro_274%	That sounds really cool.
%grethe_intro_275%	Glad to know you're not one of those medieval Witches.
%grethe_intro_276%	I can't stand them.
%grethe_intro_277%	Yeah, they're so uptight.
%grethe_intro_282%	So, Fortuna, tell me.
%grethe_intro_283%	What are your thoughts on relationships?
%grethe_intro_284%	You asking me if I'm single?
%grethe_intro_285%	No, silly.
%grethe_intro_286%	But are you?
%grethe_intro_287%	Yes.
%grethe_intro_288%	Cool.
%grethe_intro_289%	What I mean is, what are your thoughts on romantic relationships?
%grethe_intro_290%	Some people can't live without them, some others don't want them at all.
%grethe_intro_291%	I'm curious where you stand on that.
%grethe_intro_295%	What are your thoughts on relationships?
%grethe_intro_298%	Life can't be complete without one.
%grethe_intro_299%	Desirable and enjoyable.
%grethe_intro_300%	Cool but overrated.
%grethe_intro_301%	I don't get them and I don't want them.
%grethe_intro_305%	Life can't be complete without one.
%grethe_intro_306%	You must feel really miserable trapped here, then...
%grethe_intro_307%	Exile would be a lot easier with a partner, yes.
%grethe_intro_311%	Desirable and enjoyable.
%grethe_intro_313%	Although it's rare that someone catches my eye...
%grethe_intro_317%	Cool but overrated.
%grethe_intro_318%	Yeah, I agree.
%grethe_intro_319%	Actively looking for one can be pretty futile and frustrating.
%grethe_intro_320%	Better to leave that in the hands of the Cosmic Wheel.
%grethe_intro_321%	Yup.
%grethe_intro_325%	I don't get them and I don't want them.
%grethe_intro_326%	Whoa. Pity, because I like you a lot.
%grethe_intro_327%	But it's cool. I can let the sexual tension go now, haha.
%grethe_intro_328%	Sorry.
%grethe_intro_329%	It's alright! You do friends, though, right?
%grethe_intro_330%	Of course! I love having friends.
%grethe_intro_332%	Hehe, nice.
%grethe_intro_334%	Ok, for my next question...
%grethe_intro_338%	Ok, your turn again.
%grethe_intro_343%	What do you like to do in your free time?
%grethe_intro_344%	Mmm... I spend most of my time on my project...
%grethe_intro_345%	But on the rare occasion when I'm burned out I like to read.
%grethe_intro_346%	I read essays and arcane texts.
%grethe_intro_347%	Mostly philosophy... so I guess I don't ever really rest.
%grethe_intro_348%	Well, I do enjoy taking extremely long baths.
%grethe_intro_349%	Even then, I can't stop thinking. I'm cursed by my never ending quest for illumination.
%grethe_intro_350%	Have you met Jasmine?
%grethe_intro_351%	I haven't, although Dahlia speaks about her often.
%grethe_intro_352%	Why?
%grethe_intro_353%	She may have something to help you get your mind off things.
%grethe_intro_354%	Jasmine's specialty is teacraft.
%grethe_intro_355%	She's helped me through many difficult times.
%grethe_intro_356%	Cool. Witch drugs.
%grethe_intro_357%	Ah... more or less.
%grethe_intro_358%	But without the drawbacks of the substances produced by mortals.
%grethe_intro_359%	I'll try anything. Hook me up!
%grethe_intro_360%	I'll let her know.
%grethe_intro_368%	Do you value personal over collective wellbeing?
%grethe_intro_369%	Whoa, what a thing to spurt out of the blue.
%grethe_intro_370%	What's more important, yourself or the community? Yourself or the universe?
%grethe_intro_371%	And I won't accept any compromise on this one.
%grethe_intro_372%	Ultimately, should you have to choose:
%grethe_intro_373%	What should the priority be? The individual or the group?
%grethe_intro_376%	Oneself.
%grethe_intro_377%	Everyone.
%grethe_intro_381%	Oneself.
%grethe_intro_382%	Even if that has a negative impact on the universe?
%grethe_intro_385%	Yes. Fuck the system.
%grethe_intro_386%	Yes. What's the point in existing if not to be happy?
%grethe_intro_387%	You're right. Happiness should be valued globally.
%grethe_intro_391%	Yes. Fuck the system.
%grethe_intro_392%	Whoa, brutal.
%grethe_intro_393%	Although, I guess I'd be that radical too if I had to deal with what the coven's putting you through.
%grethe_intro_394%	I'm done sacrificing myself for a set of values I didn't choose.
%grethe_intro_395%	I understand.
%grethe_intro_396%	Thanks for being sincere.
%grethe_intro_397%	More questions?
%grethe_intro_401%	Yes. What's the point in existing if not to be happy?
%grethe_intro_402%	I get your point.
%grethe_intro_403%	I've put a lot of thought into this, too.
%grethe_intro_404%	Reality is a construct after all.
%grethe_intro_405%	Why be miserable if everything's going to vanish as soon as we're unplugged from the cosmos?
%grethe_intro_406%	Happiness can come from making others happy.
%grethe_intro_407%	You need to be lucky enough that it does for you, though.
%grethe_intro_408%	True.
%grethe_intro_409%	I guess there's not a definitive right answer for this one.
%grethe_intro_410%	More questions?
%grethe_intro_414%	You're right. Happiness should be valued globally.
%grethe_intro_415%	If we contribute to sustaining a healthy environment, our personal wellbeing should improve too, don't you think?
%grethe_intro_416%	You're right. But it's hard to find the right balance.
%grethe_intro_417%	If I'm miserable, is my community truly going to benefit from having me around?
%grethe_intro_418%	Ideally, if we all work together to generate collective happiness, that includes oneself, too. You should be happy in that hypothetical context, right?
%grethe_intro_419%	Maybe. But happiness is subjective.
%grethe_intro_420%	One person's paradise is another person's hell.
%grethe_intro_421%	True...
%grethe_intro_422%	I guess we won't solve universal peace today, haha.
%grethe_intro_423%	Anyway, do you have more questions?
%grethe_intro_427%	Everyone.
%grethe_intro_428%	Even if that makes you miserable?
%grethe_intro_431%	Yes. Collective wellbeing should come before any one person.
%grethe_intro_432%	I can't be truly happy if my actions hurt other people.
%grethe_intro_433%	Mmm, true. I care for the world, but only if I get to be happy.
%grethe_intro_437%	Yes. Collective wellbeing should come before any one person.
%grethe_intro_438%	Why bother existing, then?
%grethe_intro_439%	As an endgame, collective wellness should work in my favor, too.
%grethe_intro_440%	No one's that special. No matter your condition, there are always people who share similar circumstances.
%grethe_intro_441%	If we work to solve the systemic issues that cause that distress, it should help the individual along with many others.
%grethe_intro_442%	There's little good in just saving oneself.
%grethe_intro_443%	Sounds kind of utopic, but you make a good point.
%grethe_intro_444%	Cool.
%grethe_intro_445%	More questions?
%grethe_intro_449%	I can't be truly happy if my actions hurt other people.
%grethe_intro_450%	It takes a special kind of selfishness to be happy at the expense of others, right?
%grethe_intro_451%	There isn't much of a dilemma if you put it that way.
%grethe_intro_452%	I say this as a general rule.
%grethe_intro_453%	On a case by case basis, though, there are times when you have to look out for yourself and your loved ones.
%grethe_intro_454%	Yeah, I agree.
%grethe_intro_455%	Nothing is ever that easy.
%grethe_intro_456%	Just wanted to probe your thoughts on the matter.
%grethe_intro_457%	Satisfied?
%grethe_intro_458%	Yes. Thank you.
%grethe_intro_459%	Your turn.
%grethe_intro_463%	Mmm, true. I care for the world, but only if I get to be happy.
%grethe_intro_464%	It's a bit of a redundant dilemma, right?
%grethe_intro_465%	It seems obvious that the greater good has priority over a single case.
%grethe_intro_466%	But pursuing the greater good only makes sense after caring for oneself.
%grethe_intro_467%	But then, how much of ourselves should we be giving to the common wellbeing?
%grethe_intro_468%	I don't really know.
%grethe_intro_469%	I don't think there's a universal answer to this.
%grethe_intro_470%	Most communities survive on the commitment of the most devoted.
%grethe_intro_471%	And the rest of us kind of just play along.
%grethe_intro_472%	Whatever works, I guess.
%grethe_intro_473%	Do you want to know anything else?
%grethe_intro_478%	What are your thoughts on Aedana?
%grethe_intro_479%	Ooh, time to talk about the boss?
%grethe_intro_480%	I guess neither of us has a lot of sympathy for her, right?
%grethe_intro_481%	I'm not super happy with having been sentenced to a thousand years of isolation, no.
%grethe_intro_482%	And you?
%grethe_intro_483%	I summoned a Behemoth. I think that speaks for itself when it comes to my respect for authority...
%grethe_intro_484%	I didn't mind her before, though. She's always let me focus on my project.
%grethe_intro_485%	But now that I know she'll have me executed if she discovers what I did...
%grethe_intro_486%	I have to get rid of either this Behemoth or Aedana.
%grethe_intro_487%	Whoa. Heavy words.
%grethe_intro_488%	What? I'm not keen on being erased. At least not before I've finished my quest for knowledge.
%grethe_intro_489%	I understand.
%grethe_intro_495%	And you're not the only one who's fed up with our leader's policies.
%grethe_intro_496%	Aedana is full of herself if she thinks she can handle this many discontented Witches.
%grethe_intro_498%	Look, I understand we need some rules to ensure the stability of the coven.
%grethe_intro_499%	But I can't possibly agree with these arbitrary punishments.
%grethe_intro_500%	Under no circumstances should a Witch should ever be sentenced to death or exile.
%grethe_intro_501%	If someone made some bad decisions, they need guidance and forgiveness.
%grethe_intro_502%	We're supposed to be a family, not the army.
%grethe_intro_503%	I couldn't agree more.
%grethe_intro_504%	We need to construct instead of prosecute.
%grethe_intro_505%	I hear you.
%grethe_intro_509%	Fortuna.
%grethe_intro_510%	I feel like I'm ready to get my fortune read.
%grethe_intro_511%	Yes, me too.
%grethe_intro_512%	Shall we?
%grethe_intro_517%	I know enough, let's do a reading.
%grethe_intro_518%	Ah, sure. Let's dive into it.
%spread_grethe_intro_7%	I imagine that the main topic here is how to deal with that Behemoth of yours.
%spread_grethe_intro_9%	Yes, please.
%spread_grethe_intro_10%	Also, I'd like to ask about my personal quest while we're at it.
%spread_grethe_intro_11%	I doubt a single card will allow me to finally untangle the meaning of life and the cosmos, but...
%spread_grethe_intro_13%	Maybe not.
%spread_grethe_intro_14%	But I'm sure it'll be able to point you in the right direction.
%spread_grethe_intro_15%	Yes. The quest for knowledge is about asking questions from as many angles as possible.
%spread_grethe_intro_16%	And your deck is one I haven't tried yet.
%spread_grethe_intro_17%	Keep these questions in mind while I shuffle the deck.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_6%	Conquer them. The Behemoth is feeding on your fear. Stop being afraid - it's your turn to intimidate them.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_7%	Easier said than done.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_8%	But I like the idea of turning myself into the scary one.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_9%	If the deck suggests it, it's because it's possible.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_10%	And you certainly have a great deal of presence.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_12%	Hehe... you think so?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_13%	Come on, look at yourself.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_15%	The question now is how to intimidate a Behemoth...
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_16%	They might seem all otherworldly, but they're fools the same as us.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_18%	How do you know that?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_19%	Ah... clairvoyance.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_20%	Hmm... ok.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_25%	Learn as much as you can now, because you will miss the Behemoth once you're free from them.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_26%	Whoa, really?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_28%	It makes sense, though.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_29%	I've been so eager to get rid of this thing I haven't stopped to think how to take advantage of them.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_30%	If I want to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, I shouldn't be such a scaredy cat!
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_31%	The good news is that if the deck is saying you'll miss them, that means you'll get rid of them at some point.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_33%	True!
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_34%	This is great news indeed.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_36%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_41%	Do not fight them. Embrace the Behemoth. The way to stop being split is to become one.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_43%	Running inwards instead of trying to escape my fate, huh?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_44%	It is a smart way of keeping it hidden.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_45%	Instead of cutting them loose, allowing the Behemoth all the way in...
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_47%	It's a scary idea, though...
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_48%	What if I stop being me?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_49%	I don't know...
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_51%	Well, what is "me," anyway?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_52%	Existence is a river and we are never the same self at any given point in time.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_54%	Mmm... of course.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_55%	Whatever gets me closer to my objective.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_57%	Glad you're taking this optimistically, haha.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_58%	We can't control fate, right?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_59%	If life gives you Behemoths...
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_60%	Hahahaha, indeed.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_63%	Maybe it's this new self who will be the one to inherit the fruits of my labor!
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_64%	Maybe this is what the other card was talking about, right?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_65%	Ah... I can't tell. I hope so.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_66%	Argh... I can't stand the idea of missing out on the final revelation.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_67%	I'd rather believe in this to keep my motivation up.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_68%	Of course. Never give up!
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_73%	The Behemoth loves pain. Hurt them, and they will yield to you.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_75%	They love pain! A kinky one this Behemoth, aren't they?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_77%	And... How do I provide this service to them?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_78%	Do I have to inflict pain on myself, or...?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_79%	Are you able to sense the Behemoth's feelings in any way?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_81%	Mmm... I do feel some stuff, yeah.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_82%	So, maybe, as in any relationship, this is a matter of experimentation.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_84%	Oh, my... Cosmic research sure takes one down some unexpected paths, huh?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_85%	Hahahaha.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_87%	I'll put myself in the hands of the Duchess of Solace.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_88%	In the name of science, of course.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_89%	Something tells me you're going to enjoy this.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_91%	Hehe...
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_93%	Hahaha.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_98%	You will never be free. Even if detached, the Behemoth's seed will remain in your brain forever.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_99%	Wait, a metaphorical or a literal seed?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_100%	The seed will be in your brain, so I'm afraid the card is quite literal about this.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_101%	Argh... And what are the effects gonna be?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_102%	I can't tell.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_103%	I wouldn't say it'll affect your health, physically speaking, though.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_104%	But my precious thoughts! Those are more important to me than my body.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_105%	You‘ll have to work around that.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_106%	In a way, we all work around our circumstances, don't we?
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_108%	I guess... Better not to fight the unavoidable.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_109%	Serves me right for trying to summon a Behemoth in the first place.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_110%	I should have asked for help.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_111%	You still can ask for help to face whatever the cosmos has in store for you next.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_113%	You're right.
%spread_grethe_thebehemoth_114%	I'll let this serve as a lesson.
%spread_grethe_thequest_6%	You need to break even more rules to find the secrets of the cosmos. Disregard all authority. Seek the forbidden.
%spread_grethe_thequest_8%	Ah... You actually want me executed, don't you?
%spread_grethe_thequest_9%	No! This is the deck's advice, I swear!
%spread_grethe_thequest_10%	Haha, I'm just messing with you.
%spread_grethe_thequest_12%	Seriously, though, I just summoned a Behemoth.
%spread_grethe_thequest_13%	Is there anything more nefarious than that?
%spread_grethe_thequest_14%	Should I go and carve Aedana's heart out of her body and eat it or something?
%spread_grethe_thequest_15%	I wouldn't rule it out.
%spread_grethe_thequest_16%	I'm joking.
%spread_grethe_thequest_17%	Oh.
%spread_grethe_thequest_19%	Your deck has a point, though.
%spread_grethe_thequest_20%	The cosmos doesn't follow protocol or bureaucracy.
%spread_grethe_thequest_21%	If I have to quit the coven to be truly free of rules, I'll do it.
%spread_grethe_thequest_22%	Just me and the void.
%spread_grethe_thequest_23%	My mindframe as the only boundary to break.
%spread_grethe_thequest_25%	Thank you.
%spread_grethe_thequest_30%	The meaning of life lies within the minds of others. Spend more time with other people to find progress.
%spread_grethe_thequest_31%	Ah... I don't have the patience for that.
%spread_grethe_thequest_32%	I find most interactions to be pointless.
%spread_grethe_thequest_33%	Thank you.
%spread_grethe_thequest_35%	I don't mean you, silly. I'm enjoying this.
%spread_grethe_thequest_37%	I get easily bored of company for the sake of company.
%spread_grethe_thequest_38%	I need stimulus in my life. Interesting, important conversations.
%spread_grethe_thequest_40%	But... maybe that's the point I'm missing?
%spread_grethe_thequest_41%	Wasting time, playing around?
%spread_grethe_thequest_42%	I guess ideas need to be pollinated.
%spread_grethe_thequest_43%	A lonely mind can run out of ideas, become sterile.
%spread_grethe_thequest_44%	Exposure to other lifestyles and philosophies can challenge my frame of mind.
%spread_grethe_thequest_46%	It makes a lot of sense.
%spread_grethe_thequest_47%	You've helped me a great deal, Fortuna.
%spread_grethe_thequest_48%	Thank you.
%spread_grethe_thequest_50%	My pleasure.
%spread_grethe_thequest_55%	This secret knowledge will eat your mind away. The day you learn the meaning of life, you will lose touch with reality.
%spread_grethe_thequest_56%	Mmm... I can see that happening, yeah.
%spread_grethe_thequest_57%	There have been times when I even lost track of my own identity.
%spread_grethe_thequest_58%	The Thought Shrines I build... they're quite dangerous if you spend more than a year inside one.
%spread_grethe_thequest_60%	But the real question here is whether I'm willing to pay the price...
%spread_grethe_thequest_61%	I'll go mad anyway if I don't find an answer, so... I might as well go all the way.
%spread_grethe_thequest_63%	The good news is that I'll learn the secret, eventually!
%spread_grethe_thequest_65%	Maybe I'll look as if I've lost it from your perspective, but I'll be happy living in the world of ideas.
%spread_grethe_thequest_66%	I'm not getting a kick out of this world, anyway.
%spread_grethe_thequest_67%	That's a bit sad...
%spread_grethe_thequest_68%	But once you've found your calling there's no way around it, I guess.
%spread_grethe_thequest_69%	My only regret is that I won't get to share my discoveries with everyone.
%spread_grethe_thequest_70%	But now I know where I'm heading, I can stop being afraid.
%spread_grethe_thequest_71%	That's some kind of peace, I guess.
%spread_grethe_thequest_76%	You will never untangle the meaning of life, but your work will allow others to reach it.
%spread_grethe_thequest_78%	What... no... that can't be possible.
%spread_grethe_thequest_79%	I'm sorry.
%spread_grethe_thequest_80%	What am I doing all this for, then?
%spread_grethe_thequest_81%	Well, we all stand over the shoulders of giants, don't we?
%spread_grethe_thequest_82%	Mmm...
%spread_grethe_thequest_84%	You're right, I guess.
%spread_grethe_thequest_85%	I wish there was someone who'd trodden the terrain for me already.
%spread_grethe_thequest_86%	I can be that person for whatever Witch ends up on this maddening quest next.
%spread_grethe_thequest_87%	It's not a great consolation, since I don't really care whether or not my name is remembered.
%spread_grethe_thequest_88%	For what it's worth, I believe that the important part is the quest, not the outcome.
%spread_grethe_thequest_89%	It is the journey that you get to experience. The end of the line is just that: the end.
%spread_grethe_thequest_90%	Maybe that's the meaning of life, eh?
%spread_grethe_thequest_91%	Haha, yeah, solved it.
%spread_grethe_thequest_92%	Haha, thanks.
%spread_grethe_thequest_93%	I guess I'll need to do some thinking.
%spread_grethe_thequest_98%	You've done enough introspection. Now you need experience. The meaning of life is hidden beneath greatest love and greatest loss.
%spread_grethe_thequest_100%	Damn, that seems so obvious.
%spread_grethe_thequest_101%	The meaning of life is to live, isn't it?
%spread_grethe_thequest_102%	Sorry if I said something silly.
%spread_grethe_thequest_104%	No, no. You're absolutely right.
%spread_grethe_thequest_105%	I've spent so much time inside of my head, it's no wonder I'm so lost at this point.
%spread_grethe_thequest_106%	You can't appreciate a painting with your eyes closed.
%spread_grethe_thequest_108%	Time for me to do some living, huh?
%spread_grethe_thequest_109%	Sounds about right.
%spread_grethe_thequest_110%	Will you help me with that?
%spread_grethe_thequest_111%	Hahaha, it'll be my pleasure.
%spread_grethe_thequest_113%	Once I manage to get rid of this Behemoth, I'll visit you just for fun, ok?
%spread_grethe_thequest_114%	Yes, please!
%spread_grethe_thequest_116%	It's a deal.
%spread_grethe_followup_2%	Do you want to look into anything else?
%spread_grethe_followup_3%	No, thank you.
%spread_grethe_followup_5%	You've given me some ideas about how to get rid of this Behemoth.
%spread_grethe_followup_6%	I'll do some research on my side, too.
%spread_grethe_followup_7%	Cool. Let's meet again soon to teach this bastard a lesson.
%spread_grethe_followup_8%	Looking forward to it.
%spread_grethe_followup_9%	See you soon!
%abramar_offering_c3_3%	Looks like Behemoths are in.
%abramar_offering_c3_4%	Yeah, they're all the rage amongst rebel Witches with poor judgment.
%abramar_offering_c3_6%	Hahahahahaha.
%abramar_offering_c3_8%	I think I can help, if you're interested?
%abramar_offering_c3_11%	I'd rather deal with this by myself.
%abramar_offering_c3_12%	I'm all ears.
%abramar_offering_c3_16%	I'd rather deal with this by myself.
%abramar_offering_c3_17%	Oh? Why's that?
%abramar_offering_c3_18%	I don't want to get too dependent on you.
%abramar_offering_c3_19%	I used to deal with all my problems without the help of forbidden extra dimensional beings.
%abramar_offering_c3_20%	Pride it is, then.
%abramar_offering_c3_21%	It may be pride, yeah.
%abramar_offering_c3_22%	Not that I don't understand.
%abramar_offering_c3_23%	I feel you.
%abramar_offering_c3_25%	It's gonna be fun to watch for me either way.
%abramar_offering_c3_26%	Glad you're having fun.
%abramar_offering_c3_27%	I am, indeed. Thanks for summoning me back to Witchland.
%abramar_offering_c3_28%	I'll leave you to it.
%abramar_offering_c3_34%	I'm all ears.
%abramar_offering_c3_35%	We, the Behemoth, know each others' names.
%abramar_offering_c3_36%	If you knew the name of the Behemoth possessing Grethe, any ritual you might perform to free her would be more likely to succeed.
%abramar_offering_c3_37%	That's perfect. Tell me their name.
%abramar_offering_c3_38%	Ah... I know we're partners in crime, but I'm not about to give up one of my siblings.
%abramar_offering_c3_40%	Not for free, at least.
%abramar_offering_c3_41%	Am I not paying enough to you already?
%abramar_offering_c3_43%	The deck stuff is one thing. This is another matter.
%abramar_offering_c3_44%	Alright... what do you want?
%abramar_offering_c3_45%	Don't fret. I just want a bit of that delicious power you're harvesting.
%abramar_offering_c3_46%	Five units of Fire to betray a fellow Behemoth, plus two of Air to release their name to you Witches.
%abramar_offering_c3_47%	Mmm...
%abramar_offering_c3_48%	You don't need to answer right now.
%abramar_offering_c3_49%	Save up, decide if you're interested or not.
%abramar_offering_c3_50%	And when the time comes to try and free Grethe, you just let that energy flow to me and I'll whisper the Behemoth's name to your ear.
%abramar_offering_c3_51%	I see...
%abramar_offering_c3_52%	It's not too high of a cost, right?
%abramar_offering_c3_53%	Just a bit of magic for your dear mentor.
%abramar_offering_c3_54%	It's not the amount, but the thought of what you're planning to do with it.
%abramar_offering_c3_56%	Hahahahahaha.
%abramar_offering_c3_58%	Still afraid of me after all this time?
%abramar_offering_c3_59%	Just cautious.
%abramar_offering_c3_60%	I'm sure you're a forbidden entity for a reason.
%abramar_offering_c3_62%	Suit yourself.
%abramar_offering_c3_63%	But I'll say it again: I am on your side.
%abramar_offering_c3_64%	Trust needs time.
%abramar_offering_c3_65%	I understand.
%abramar_offering_c3_66%	Well, you let me know if you want to take me up on my offer when the time comes.
%abramar_offering_c3_67%	Have fun!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_3%	Heya, Forts!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_4%	Hey, Dahlia.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_5%	I know it's been two centuries, but I still don't like any abbreviations of my name.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_7%	Oh, shoot. I thought Forts would work.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_8%	We've been through this too many times.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_9%	I don't like "Fort." I don't like "Forty." And I especially don't like "Tuna."
%grethe_dahlia_followup_11%	Ahahaha, but Tuna is so cute!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_12%	Not funny!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_13%	Hahaha, ok, ok.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_14%	So, you found a way to help Grethe?
%grethe_dahlia_followup_16%	Right!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_17%	I've been researching some exorcism methods.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_18%	And I found some censored texts. They don't mention Behemoths explicitly, but they might be the perfect solution for this case.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_19%	There is a way to quite literally sever extra dimensional beings from a Witch.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_20%	Oh, yeah? How?
%grethe_dahlia_followup_21%	With an enchanted blade.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_23%	I'm going to forge a Daemonbone Dagger to cut that bastard down.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_24%	That sounds... dangerous.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_26%	I know my way around knives, trust me.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_27%	You're right, you're right.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_28%	And you mentioned you need my help with this?
%grethe_dahlia_followup_29%	That's correct.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_30%	For the ritual to be most effective, I need to imbue the dagger with an essence kindred to Grethe.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_31%	And I was wondering, since you put her through your wonderful deck, maybe you could point me to the proper energy.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_32%	But... wouldn't you know best? You've known Grethe way longer than I have.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_33%	I know... but I can't wrap my head around her.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_34%	She's so self-absorbed, always focused on her projects... I realized I can't really tell.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_35%	You don't need to disclose any sensitive information to me, but I've experienced first-hand how incisive your divination can be.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_36%	You did read the cards for her, right?
%grethe_dahlia_followup_37%	Yes.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_38%	Perfect. Your guess should be better than mine, then.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_39%	What energy should I imbue the dagger with?
%grethe_dahlia_followup_42%	Individualism.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_43%	Determination.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_44%	Truth.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_45%	Dread.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_46%	Philosophy.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_47%	Architecture.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_52%	Individualism.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_53%	Mmm... I would never have said that. But I guess it makes sense.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_58%	Determination.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_59%	Oh, that is a powerful essence. And Grethe's a driven one, isn't she?
%grethe_dahlia_followup_64%	Truth.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_65%	Whoa, that's so on point! It synthesizes Grethe's essence perfectly.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_66%	I knew you were the right one to nail this.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_71%	Dread.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_72%	Oh, poor Grethe... But it makes a lot of sense, given her personal quest.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_77%	Philosophy.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_78%	Oooh! That sounds right. I'm way too simple to come up with such an essence.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_79%	I'm more about... Fear! And strength! And joy!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_80%	I wouldn't even have considered philosophy to be a type of essence to begin with! Hahaha.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_85%	Architecture.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_86%	Architecture? Isn't that like... super literal?
%grethe_dahlia_followup_87%	Hey, you asked me.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_88%	Yeah, maybe I was just overthinking this.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_89%	She sure does enjoy building stuff.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_94%	Alright!!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_95%	I'll smith the most impressive dagger!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_96%	Just yout wait, Grethe!
%grethe_dahlia_followup_2_2%	Haha, wow. Goodbye, Dahlia.
%grethe_dahlia_followup_2_3%	...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_2%	Ah! Actually, wait a minute.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_3%	Mmm? What is it?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_6%	I need some herbs to help a Witch friend, Grethe.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_7%	On second thought, never mind.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_11%	On second thought, never mind.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_12%	Is something the matter?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_13%	No, no, I'm sorry.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_14%	I was about to ask for your help with something.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_15%	But I realized it's not my place to tell anyone about it.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_16%	Hmm...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_17%	You'll let me know if you're in any trouble, right?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_18%	Yes, yes, don't worry.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_19%	It's alright.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_20%	Ok. Take care, Fortuna.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_25%	I need some herbs to help a Witch friend, Grethe.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_26%	Oh! You've met Grethe the Architect? Dahlia's friend?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_27%	She's never got time for me! Now I'm jealous!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_28%	Ah... it was a business visit.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_29%	She seems like a very busy Witch.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_31%	And what does the fabulous Grethe need from me, that she doesn't even have time to ask me for in person?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_32%	Oh, my... you're actually jealous.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_33%	She's not the one asking, anyway. I am asking you, as my friend, to help me help her.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_35%	Ok, ok. Anything for you.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_36%	What are these herbs for?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_39%	Grethe's been possessed by a Behemoth.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_40%	Something to ease her mind.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_44%	Grethe's been possessed by a Behemoth.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_46%	But that's forbidden magic!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_47%	Yes. An experiment gone awry...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_48%	We need you to be discreet on this.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_50%	How can you ask this of me!?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_51%	We need to report to Aedana immediately!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_52%	What!? No!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_53%	She just made a mistake, and we're trying to fix it!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_54%	I'm sorry, but no.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_55%	And I'm doing this for your own good, Fortuna!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_56%	Behemoths are forbidden for a reason.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_57%	The Magical Pact is the most sacred thing. It keeps us Witches from breaking apart!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_58%	No, Jasmine, please...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_59%	I'm sorry. We need to solve this the proper way.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_60%	Aedana will learn about this.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_62%	You're sending Grethe to her execution...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_64%	Not necessarily. You need to put more faith in our leader.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_65%	I'm sure she will be fair, and will look for a solution.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_66%	I doubt it...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_67%	Please, Jasmine, don't do this...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_68%	I'm sorry. It's for the good of the coven.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_69%	And for your own good, too.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_70%	You wouldn't want to add to your sentence, right?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_71%	Jasmine...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_72%	We will fix this. Trust me.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_73%	...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_79%	Something to ease her mind.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_80%	Is she stressed, or...?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_81%	She's really anxious about a personal problem.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_82%	I'm looking for a way to heal her.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_83%	But whatever ritual we attempt, it would help to have her relaxed.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_84%	I see...
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_85%	Well, that's a pretty common ailment, a distressed mind.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_86%	I have something on me that might help.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_88%	Oh?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_89%	Bacopa monnieri mixed with chamomile.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_90%	Infuse it with a bit of lemon or honey, and have Grethe drink it while she thinks about a toy she loved back when she was a mortal kid.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_92%	I've never seen it fail.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_93%	Thank you so much, Jasmine!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_94%	This is exactly what I needed.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_96%	You're welcome.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_97%	And maybe Grethe will deign to thank me in person next time?
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_98%	Hahaha. Do you have some herbs against jealousy? It's for a friend of mine.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_99%	Shut up!
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_100%	Ok, I must go now.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_101%	Thanks again.
%louise_jas_followup_add_grethe_102%	Goodbye!
%grethe_ritual_2%	Hey, how are you feeling?
%grethe_ritual_3%	Mmm... Corrupted?
%grethe_ritual_4%	The Behemoth is beginning to taint my thoughts, and I don't like how… powerful it feels.
%grethe_ritual_5%	You still want to see this through, or...?
%grethe_ritual_6%	Of course I want to!
%grethe_ritual_7%	I'm way too proud to let this extradimensional asshole take all the credit.
%grethe_ritual_8%	Hahaha, I feel you.
%grethe_ritual_9%	Ok, what did you find? Let's use everything in our arsenal.
%grethe_ritual_10%	The ritual will mainly revolve around Dahlia's Daemonbone Dagger.
%grethe_ritual_11%	It truly is a work of art. Here, look.
%grethe_ritual_13%	Beautiful.
%grethe_ritual_14%	How can Dahlia be so talented?
%grethe_ritual_15%	She told me that you helped her create it?
%grethe_ritual_16%	Ah... I just shared some insight with her.
%grethe_ritual_17%	What about?
%grethe_ritual_18%	She wanted to know what kind of essence to use to enchant the dagger.
%grethe_ritual_19%	To craft a blade that has the highest affinity with you.
%grethe_ritual_26%	So that's why she called this an "Architect's Dagger," huh?
%grethe_ritual_28%	It's not really a common tool for us to use, hahaha.
%grethe_ritual_30%	Sounds really cool. Thanks for helping her.
%grethe_ritual_34%	So that's why she called it the "Lone Wolf's Dagger."
%grethe_ritual_35%	Is that how you see me?
%grethe_ritual_36%	Ah... I suggested "individualism" as an essence, since you seem so strong and independent.
%grethe_ritual_38%	Ah... maybe.
%grethe_ritual_39%	My fault for putting up this suave front.
%grethe_ritual_40%	There's some truth in the blade, I guess. It'll do.
%grethe_ritual_44%	So that's why she called it "The Dagger of the Driven," huh?
%grethe_ritual_45%	Not bad, Fortuna, not bad.
%grethe_ritual_46%	Thanks for the compliment, in any case.
%grethe_ritual_47%	Ah... I was just trying to help!
%grethe_ritual_49%	Haha. You're so cute when you get shy.
%grethe_ritual_51%	Stop it. Let's focus on the ritual.
%grethe_ritual_55%	Whoa, so that's why she called it "The Blade of Truth!"
%grethe_ritual_56%	I love it! This is the best dagger I could get!
%grethe_ritual_57%	You totally get me, Fortuna.
%grethe_ritual_58%	Thank you so much.
%grethe_ritual_59%	Hahaha, my pleasure. Glad you like it.
%grethe_ritual_61%	This is perfect.
%grethe_ritual_65%	So that's why she called this "The Existential Dread Edge," hmm...
%grethe_ritual_66%	I don't like that being my defining characteristic...
%grethe_ritual_67%	But you may be right.
%grethe_ritual_68%	...
%grethe_ritual_70%	Thank you.
%grethe_ritual_74%	Oh, cool, so that's why she called this "The Philosopher's Edge."
%grethe_ritual_75%	I guess I am more of a philosopher than an architect in the end, huh?
%grethe_ritual_76%	You build Thought Shrines to literally lock yourself up inside to think.
%grethe_ritual_78%	Hahaha, that's true. It's so obvious when you look at it from the outside.
%grethe_ritual_80%	Maybe I should stop calling myself an Architect Witch, huh?
%grethe_ritual_81%	You literally build Thought Shrines to lock yourself up inside to think.
%grethe_ritual_83%	Hahaha, true, true.
%grethe_ritual_86%	So, first of all, do you mind if I summon a Fatemancer's Disk to check on our chances of success?
%grethe_ritual_87%	Of course, but what's a Fatemancer's Disk?
%grethe_ritual_88%	Ah, of course, it was invented about eighty years ago by Junreisha, the Mathematician Witch... so you wouldn't know about it.
%grethe_ritual_89%	It's a special sigil that reads fate strands.
%grethe_ritual_90%	When you find yourself before a critical and identifiable turning point in your life, you can bind your soul to the disk so it reads the probability of whatever you want to happen.
%grethe_ritual_91%	Wow, I like it. Sounds like a great companion to my deck.
%grethe_ritual_92%	In short, we can read how effective whatever actions we perform in the ritual will be.
%grethe_ritual_93%	Knowing the percentage may not change anything, though... It's just for peace of mind.
%grethe_ritual_94%	On the contrary, it sounds really useful.
%grethe_ritual_95%	As per The Third Principle of Divination, just the act of observing your chances affects your chances.
%grethe_ritual_96%	Hmm... I didn't consider it that way. I hope it affects them for the best, heh.
%grethe_ritual_97%	Anyway, here's the disk.
%grethe_ritual_2_3%	Oh...
%grethe_ritual_2_4%	My chances aren't as good as I'd hoped...
%grethe_ritual_2_5%	It's no small thing, exorcizing a Behemoth.
%grethe_ritual_2_6%	But we haven't taken everything into account yet.
%grethe_ritual_2_7%	Let's turn fate in our favor.
%grethe_ritual_2_9%	You're right. I must be strong.
%grethe_ritual_2_13%	First of all, I asked my friend Jasmine to provide us with some herbs to help ease your mind.
%grethe_ritual_2_14%	With these, you should be able to focus better on the ritual.
%grethe_ritual_2_16%	Smells good.
%grethe_ritual_2_17%	You need to drink the infusion while you think of a toy you loved when you were a mortal child.
%grethe_ritual_2_19%	Mmm...
%grethe_ritual_2_20%	I sure loved my Legos...
%grethe_ritual_2_22%	But my favorite thing was my Jake plushie from Adventure Time.
%grethe_ritual_2_23%	I don't know what that is, but it sure worked on your face already.
%grethe_ritual_2_24%	Hahaha... I feel less tense. Yes.
%grethe_ritual_2_26%	Look, the Fatemancer's Disk went up slightly.
%grethe_ritual_2_27%	This is working.
%grethe_ritual_2_29%	Good. Thank Jasmine for me.
%grethe_ritual_2_30%	I think it'll be better if you thank her yourself, haha.
%grethe_ritual_2_31%	Sure, it'll be my pleasure.
%grethe_ritual_2_33%	Ok, then. Can you run me through the specifics of the ritual?
%grethe_ritual_2_34%	It's more straightforward than I thought it would be.
%grethe_ritual_2_35%	Most of the heavy work has already been done by Dahlia, crafting this magnificent dagger.
%grethe_ritual_2_38%	You need to insert the blade into my chest.
%grethe_ritual_2_39%	Me!??
%grethe_ritual_2_40%	You need to try and leave one side of the blade facing my flesh, and the other side facing the Behemoth.
%grethe_ritual_2_42%	I've never stabbed anyone in my life!
%grethe_ritual_2_43%	It's not so much stabbing as... precision cooking.
%grethe_ritual_2_44%	You do cook, right?
%grethe_ritual_2_45%	Yeah, I know my way around kitchen knives, but this...
%grethe_ritual_2_46%	I can't do it myself, Fortuna.
%grethe_ritual_2_47%	I believe in you.
%grethe_ritual_2_48%	Why don't we call Dahlia and have her cut you?
%grethe_ritual_2_49%	No.
%grethe_ritual_2_50%	I want you to do it.
%grethe_ritual_2_51%	I feel a special connection to you.
%grethe_ritual_2_52%	I...
%grethe_ritual_2_56%	I brought Dahlia up to speed about what your cards said.
%grethe_ritual_2_57%	About how I need to embrace the Behemoth. Her answer was this blade.
%grethe_ritual_2_58%	You need to stab me in the heart.
%grethe_ritual_2_59%	What!? No!
%grethe_ritual_2_60%	Don't panic. The blade is enchanted to pierce not only through my flesh but also through my quintessence.
%grethe_ritual_2_61%	That will open a crack in my soul, allowing the Behemoth fully inside me.
%grethe_ritual_2_62%	Then you can remove the dagger, and they will be trapped.
%grethe_ritual_2_66%	I brought Dahlia up to speed about what your cards said. About how this Behemoth loves pain.
%grethe_ritual_2_67%	So you just need to stab them in one of these white eyes, for example.
%grethe_ritual_2_68%	The dagger will gradually turn hot to keep the pain fresh. Make sure not to touch the blade.
%grethe_ritual_2_69%	But... won't I hurt you?
%grethe_ritual_2_70%	I share sensations with the Behemoth, yes. But if they enjoy it, I probably will too.
%grethe_ritual_2_71%	I'm not worried about that.
%grethe_ritual_2_72%	When they're lost in the pain, it'll be my opportunity to detach myself.
%grethe_ritual_2_73%	You hold the dagger firmly with both hands. If everything goes according to plan, they'll choose to stay with the blade instead of with me.
%grethe_ritual_2_78%	Look, the percentage on the disk went up just from me explaining this to you. We're on the right path.
%grethe_ritual_2_79%	Dahlia told me that the ritual will be more effective the stronger our bond is.
%grethe_ritual_2_81%	I pretty much opened up about myself to you in a way I haven't for ages.
%grethe_ritual_2_82%	So, I believe a shortcut to make our bond more powerful would be if you told me something intimate about yourself.
%grethe_ritual_2_83%	The less people know about it, the better.
%grethe_ritual_2_84%	Ah... ok.
%grethe_ritual_2_85%	Tell me something secret about yourself.
%grethe_ritual_2_88%	I summoned a Behemoth, too.
%grethe_ritual_2_89%	I've tried to kill myself numerous times while exiled.
%grethe_ritual_2_90%	I have a sister. Her name is Patrice.
%grethe_ritual_2_91%	I used to own a food truck.
%grethe_ritual_2_96%	I summoned a Behemoth, too.
%grethe_ritual_2_97%	Shut up.
%grethe_ritual_2_98%	You're putting your life in my hands so I guess it's only fair I do the same.
%grethe_ritual_2_99%	Ábramar, show yourself.
%grethe_ritual_2_102%	Holy cosmos.
%grethe_ritual_2_103%	How is this possible?
%grethe_ritual_2_104%	No one knows about this. Not even my closest friends.
%grethe_ritual_2_106%	Why do you have a Behemoth?
%grethe_ritual_2_107%	I don't have him. We're partners.
%grethe_ritual_2_108%	We're only talking today because I summoned him.
%grethe_ritual_2_109%	I couldn't endure my exile anymore.
%grethe_ritual_2_110%	So I called upon him, and we're working together to regain my freedom.
%grethe_ritual_2_111%	Ábramar is the one who taught me how to channel arcana to build my own deck.
%grethe_ritual_2_112%	I owe him my life.
%grethe_ritual_2_113%	That is... for lack of a better word...
%grethe_ritual_2_115%	So cool.
%grethe_ritual_2_116%	Fuck. It feels so good to say it out loud to another person.
%grethe_ritual_2_117%	Thank you for understanding.
%grethe_ritual_2_118%	Are you kidding? I'm like, the ideal audience for that kind of revelation, hahaha.
%grethe_ritual_2_120%	Jokes aside, thank you for trusting me.
%grethe_ritual_2_121%	I feel really fortunate.
%grethe_ritual_2_122%	And this goes without saying, but you can rely on me.
%grethe_ritual_2_123%	Now we're sisters in the forbidden.
%grethe_ritual_2_124%	Hahaha. The best kind of sisterhood there is.
%grethe_ritual_2_125%	Ábramar, you can leave us now.
%grethe_ritual_2_126%	Understood.
%grethe_ritual_2_131%	I've tried to kill myself numerous times while exiled.
%grethe_ritual_2_133%	Oh, no... I'm so sorry, Fortuna.
%grethe_ritual_2_135%	I'm used to spending years by myself, just doing research.
%grethe_ritual_2_136%	But I see how isolation could do a number on someone more used to company.
%grethe_ritual_2_137%	Hey, I thought I was a loner too.
%grethe_ritual_2_138%	I spent most of my time by myself.
%grethe_ritual_2_139%	But two hundred years of complete social deprivation....
%grethe_ritual_2_140%	You lose the capacity to discern if you're even alive to begin with.
%grethe_ritual_2_141%	I've come to the conclusion that existence isn't possible without others to witness it.
%grethe_ritual_2_142%	That was insensitive of me, I'm sorry.
%grethe_ritual_2_143%	No one could possibly imagine what you've been through.
%grethe_ritual_2_144%	I disfigured, mutilated, even burnt myself. Just to feel something new inside these walls.
%grethe_ritual_2_145%	But I always ended up putting myself back together.
%grethe_ritual_2_146%	To get to see my loved ones again someday.
%grethe_ritual_2_147%	Or just to get back at Aedana.
%grethe_ritual_2_148%	I swear. She is going to pay.
%grethe_ritual_2_149%	Fortuna...
%grethe_ritual_2_150%	I will help you. To get back at Aedana.
%grethe_ritual_2_151%	I'm sick of her too.
%grethe_ritual_2_152%	She needs to pay.
%grethe_ritual_2_153%	Thanks for sharing this with me.
%grethe_ritual_2_155%	I'm sorry you had to say these things out loud just to help me fix the stupid mistake I made.
%grethe_ritual_2_156%	I don't think what you did was stupid.
%grethe_ritual_2_157%	And... it feels good to be able to share this stuff.
%grethe_ritual_2_158%	I wasn't brave enough to let my friends know.
%grethe_ritual_2_159%	I'm happy I met you.
%grethe_ritual_2_161%	I'm happy too.
%grethe_ritual_2_163%	Thank you for letting me in, Fortuna.
%grethe_ritual_2_167%	I have a sister. Her name is Patrice.
%grethe_ritual_2_169%	Oh, yeah? You don't strike me as someone with a sister.
%grethe_ritual_2_170%	What's she like?
%grethe_ritual_2_171%	Better than me in every way.
%grethe_ritual_2_172%	She is bold, brave, smart...
%grethe_ritual_2_173%	So far it sounds like you're describing yourself.
%grethe_ritual_2_174%	Maybe... But she's not only strong. She's a force of nature.
%grethe_ritual_2_175%	She has a clear understanding of herself. She knows what she wants.
%grethe_ritual_2_176%	She sounds like a great sister to have around.
%grethe_ritual_2_177%	Ah... She's not really around anymore.
%grethe_ritual_2_178%	All these things I'm telling you are things I wasn't able to say to her face.
%grethe_ritual_2_179%	We parted ways on… not the greatest of terms.
%grethe_ritual_2_181%	I see...
%grethe_ritual_2_182%	After what you experienced, two hundred years isolated...
%grethe_ritual_2_183%	Do you think you would be able to speak honestly with her, if you were to meet her again?
%grethe_ritual_2_184%	Mmm... I haven't really thought about it.
%grethe_ritual_2_185%	The first emotion that comes to mind is shame.
%grethe_ritual_2_186%	I feel ashamed for ending up like this.
%grethe_ritual_2_187%	I feel like she would be disappointed in me.
%grethe_ritual_2_188%	Hey, what are you saying?
%grethe_ritual_2_189%	You are the victim in this scenario.
%grethe_ritual_2_190%	Fuck Aedana. You're the best.
%grethe_ritual_2_191%	Yeah, I usually think like that.
%grethe_ritual_2_192%	But just picturing my sister... makes me feel ashamed. I don't know.
%grethe_ritual_2_193%	I don't really understand. But I support you.
%grethe_ritual_2_194%	Thanks for opening up to me.
%grethe_ritual_2_196%	Thank you for listening.
%grethe_ritual_2_200%	I used to own a food truck.
%grethe_ritual_2_201%	Ah...
%grethe_ritual_2_203%	It was back in the sixties, on Earth.
%grethe_ritual_2_204%	I visited a lot of events. Met a lot of hippie folks.
%grethe_ritual_2_205%	Had a side business reading Tarot, too.
%grethe_ritual_2_206%	That sounds really cool.
%grethe_ritual_2_207%	Glad to know you're not one of those medieval Witches.
%grethe_ritual_2_208%	I can't stand them.
%grethe_ritual_2_209%	Yeah, they're so uptight.
%grethe_ritual_2_210%	This doesn't really sound like a major revelation, though...
%grethe_ritual_2_212%	But I understand. It was selfish of me to ask you to open up like that just for my sake.
%grethe_ritual_2_213%	I'm sorry... It's not easy.
%grethe_ritual_2_214%	It's ok, really. We'll make it work with what we have.
%grethe_ritual_2_217%	Yeah, you mentioned that already...
%grethe_ritual_2_218%	Ah. I forgot...
%grethe_ritual_2_219%	We're not forging any bonds with this...
%grethe_ritual_2_223%	Time to put me under the knife?
%grethe_ritual_2_224%	Ah! I'm not ready yet!
%grethe_ritual_2_225%	You will never be more ready than now.
%grethe_ritual_2_226%	And I'm ready to accept any consequences.
%grethe_ritual_2_227%	Ah... Just...
%grethe_ritual_2_228%	Let me meditate for a couple of minutes, just to gather my focus, ok?
%grethe_ritual_2_230%	Two whole minutes? That I have, sure.
%grethe_ritual_2_231%	Thank you.
%grethe_abramar_sell_3%	Moment of truth.
%grethe_abramar_sell_4%	Have you made a decision?
%grethe_abramar_sell_5%	Do you want to pay for the Behemoth's name?
%grethe_abramar_sell_8%	Yes. (5 of Fire, 2 of Air.)
%grethe_abramar_sell_9%	No. I think we can manage without you.
%grethe_abramar_sell_13%	Yes.
%grethe_abramar_sell_14%	Allow me to absorb your energy, then.
%grethe_abramar_sell_17%	Hmm...
%grethe_abramar_sell_19%	DELICIOUS!!
%grethe_abramar_sell_21%	Ah... the fragrance of conflict.
%grethe_abramar_sell_22%	Hereby, I release my sibling's name:
%grethe_abramar_sell_23%	Gaethëryan.
%grethe_abramar_sell_26%	Thank you, Ábramar.
%grethe_abramar_sell_27%	At your service.
%grethe_abramar_sell_32%	Urgh...
%grethe_abramar_sell_33%	What's this?
%grethe_abramar_sell_34%	You don't have enough energy, Fortuna.
%grethe_abramar_sell_35%	Come on, don't waste our time.
%grethe_abramar_sell_36%	You're better than this.
%grethe_abramar_sell_41%	No. I think we can manage without you.
%grethe_abramar_sell_42%	So that's how much you value Grethe's fate, huh...
%grethe_abramar_sell_43%	Or maybe we just don't need you.
%grethe_abramar_sell_45%	Hahahaha, yes. Funny.
%grethe_abramar_sell_47%	Suit yourself.
%grethe_ritual_3_3%	...
%grethe_ritual_3_5%	...
%grethe_ritual_3_6%	...
%grethe_ritual_3_7%	You still there?
%grethe_ritual_3_8%	Yes! I'm ready.
%grethe_ritual_3_12%	I learnt your Behemoth's name:
%grethe_ritual_3_13%	Gaethëryan.
%grethe_ritual_3_16%	Whoa! The Fatemancer's Disk went wild!
%grethe_ritual_3_17%	How did you do that?
%grethe_ritual_3_19%	Perks of being a fortune teller.
%grethe_ritual_3_21%	Uh... Ok.
%grethe_ritual_3_22%	I guess I don't need to know.
%grethe_ritual_3_24%	But I'm happy you did whatever you did. Thank you.
%grethe_ritual_3_27%	I made a mental pact with Ábramar.
%grethe_ritual_3_28%	I purchased your Behemoth's name from him.
%grethe_ritual_3_30%	"Purchased?"
%grethe_ritual_3_31%	I hope you didn't put yourself at risk for me, Fortuna.
%grethe_ritual_3_32%	Don't worry, it wasn't that expensive.
%grethe_ritual_3_33%	...I think.
%grethe_ritual_3_35%	Thank you so much for going the extra mile for me.
%grethe_ritual_3_36%	We sisters in the forbidden must stand together, right?
%grethe_ritual_3_37%	Haha, you're right.
%grethe_ritual_3_40%	Sorry, I just needed to collect myself.
%grethe_ritual_3_43%	Ready for some stabbing?
%grethe_ritual_3_44%	Don't say it like that!
%grethe_ritual_3_45%	Sorry, I was just trying to blow off some steam.
%grethe_ritual_3_46%	Our ideas of what constitutes "relaxing" differ dramatically, Grethe.
%grethe_ritual_3_48%	Hahahaha.
%grethe_ritual_3_49%	It looks like you're relaxed though.
%grethe_ritual_3_50%	I guess that's the most important thing here.
%grethe_ritual_3_52%	Ok, I am going to... insert the dagger now.
%grethe_ritual_3_53%	Are you ready?
%grethe_ritual_3_55%	Do it.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_5%	...
%grethe_ritual_outcome_6%	It didn't work.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_7%	I'm so sorry, Grethe.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_8%	Maybe I didn't use the dagger properly...
%grethe_ritual_outcome_10%	No. You did everything just right.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_11%	I had an internal bout with the Behemoth and they were just... stronger than me.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_13%	I guess I wasn't destined to be free.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_14%	Not yet, at least.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_16%	This is who I am for now. Better accept it and start preparing for the real problem.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_17%	...Aedana?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_18%	Aedana.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_19%	What are you going to do?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_20%	My initial impulse is to flee.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_21%	But I'm too proud not to face Aedana directly.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_22%	So I guess before I do anything hasty, I'll retire to the Gem Skull Belt and meditate on all my options.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_23%	I'm sorry the ritual didn't go well.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_24%	Even if we failed here, let me know if I can help you in any other way.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_26%	I will.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_27%	Thank you for everything, Fortuna.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_28%	And hey, I'm not going away empty handed.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_30%	Now I have you.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_31%	Hahaha, I'm happy I met you, too.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_33%	Ok, better leave now.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_34%	I hope to see you soon.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_35%	Yeah, me too. Take care.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_41%	So? How do I look?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_42%	We did it, Grethe!!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_44%	Hahaha, yeah, I know!!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_45%	You're the best, Fortuna!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_46%	Thank you so much!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_47%	Aaaah... I was so nervous! My heart was about to explode!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_48%	Where is the Behemoth now?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_50%	They escaped.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_51%	While you were pushing the dagger inside me, we had a very intense discussion that felt like it lasted eons.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_52%	Finally, they... got scared of me?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_53%	It's like you were fueling me with some energy larger than this universe.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_55%	It felt so empowering. You are amazing, Fortuna.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_56%	I'm so happy for you.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_57%	What now?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_59%	I'm going to make a round to share the good news.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_60%	Especially with Dahlia. I owe her my life, too.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_61%	Yeah, she deserves more credit than anyone.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_62%	I promise I'll come visit you again soon.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_63%	I didn't only regain my freedom here.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_65%	I also gained you.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_66%	Hahaha, I'm happy I met you, too.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_67%	Ok, take care. See you soon!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_68%	Goodbye!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_74%	It worked!! Fortuna! We did it!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_75%	Oh... Thank the cosmos.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_76%	I felt like my heart was about to explode.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_77%	How are you feeling?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_79%	Better than ever.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_80%	!!!
%grethe_ritual_outcome_81%	Grethe... your eyes.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_82%	What's the matter?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_83%	They're... Behemoth-like?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_84%	That bad?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_85%	I mean, aesthetically, it's pretty cool.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_86%	But I think the ritual may have gone wrong at some point.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_87%	No, no. It went perfectly fine, I assure you.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_88%	I went through, like... this intense bout with the Behemoth that felt like it lasted eons.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_89%	But we ended up forming a pact.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_90%	We're partners now.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_94%	Just like you and Ábramar.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_96%	Ah... maybe you solved that issue.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_97%	But the fact you summoned a Behemoth is still quite... visible.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_98%	I see...
%grethe_ritual_outcome_99%	Well, the way I feel now, Fortuna...
%grethe_ritual_outcome_100%	All the knowledge and power I've just gained...
%grethe_ritual_outcome_101%	It's worth the price.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_102%	Now we just need to figure out how to deal with Aedana.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_103%	Ah... ok.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_104%	What are you gonna do?
%grethe_ritual_outcome_106%	Mmm...
%grethe_ritual_outcome_107%	My initial impulse is to flee.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_108%	But I'm too proud to not face Aedana directly.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_109%	So I guess that before doing anything rash I'll retire to the Gem Skull Belt and meditate on all my options.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_110%	I'm sorry the ritual didn't go as expected.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_111%	But I'm still with you. Let me know if I can help you in any other way.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_113%	I will.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_114%	Thank you for everything, Fortuna.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_115%	And hey, I'm not going away empty handed.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_117%	Now I have you.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_118%	Hahaha, I'm happy I met you, too.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_120%	Ok, I'd better leave now.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_121%	I hope to see you soon.
%grethe_ritual_outcome_122%	Yeah, me too. Take care.
%abramar_closure_c3_3%	What a busy life all of a sudden, huh?
%abramar_closure_c3_5%	How are you feeling?
%abramar_closure_c3_8%	It feels good!
%abramar_closure_c3_9%	I still miss being able to leave the house.
%abramar_closure_c3_10%	How did they manage without me all this time?
%abramar_closure_c3_14%	It feels good!
%abramar_closure_c3_15%	Life is worth living again.
%abramar_closure_c3_16%	Haha, glad to see your mood has improved.
%abramar_closure_c3_20%	I still miss being able to leave the house...
%abramar_closure_c3_21%	Well, in due time, my friend.
%abramar_closure_c3_22%	We've made a lot of progress in a matter of days, wouldn't you say?
%abramar_closure_c3_23%	Yes. You're right.
%abramar_closure_c3_24%	I should focus on enjoying this.
%abramar_closure_c3_25%	That's the spirit.
%abramar_closure_c3_29%	How did they manage without me all this time?
%abramar_closure_c3_31%	Hahahahahaha!
%abramar_closure_c3_33%	Looks like the best Witch is back in the game.
%abramar_closure_c3_34%	Stop sucking up to me, what do you want?
%abramar_closure_c3_36%	Hey, I'm genuinely happy for you.
%abramar_closure_c3_37%	I enjoy watching my protégé thriving.
%abramar_closure_c3_38%	Heh.
%abramar_closure_c3_42%	So, what are your plans now?
%abramar_closure_c3_43%	Mmm...
%abramar_closure_c3_44%	My biggest concern is still Aedana.
%abramar_closure_c3_45%	Sooner or later, she's going to find out about my new deck.
%abramar_closure_c3_46%	If I want to be free, I'll need to deal with her at some point.
%abramar_closure_c3_47%	Well, the Cosmic Wheel is already in motion.
%abramar_closure_c3_48%	Look how quickly you've reconnected with the coven.
%abramar_closure_c3_49%	Just stay alert and seize any opportunity the universe throws at us.
%abramar_closure_c3_50%	How do you do it, manipulate fate?
%abramar_closure_c3_51%	You tell me. We're not so different.
%abramar_closure_c3_52%	Not really... I mean, I get to read into possible futures.
%abramar_closure_c3_53%	But escaping from Aedana's sentence was an impossibility until I summoned you.
%abramar_closure_c3_55%	Are you sure?
%abramar_closure_c3_56%	It was by your will that I appeared.
%abramar_closure_c3_58%	You're the one making the jigsaw fall into place.
%abramar_closure_c3_59%	Hmm...
%abramar_closure_c3_60%	Are you suggesting that I'm the one that created you?
%abramar_closure_c3_61%	What?
%abramar_closure_c3_63%	HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
%abramar_closure_c3_65%	Please, Witch.
%abramar_closure_c3_66%	I was just trying to encourage you.
%abramar_closure_c3_67%	You owe me a lot, and you're paying a high price for all this. Don't forget it.
%abramar_closure_c3_69%	But you summoned me.
%abramar_closure_c3_70%	That speaks volumes about the power of your will.
%abramar_closure_c3_71%	Have more faith in yourself.
%abramar_closure_c3_72%	Ok, ok. No need to mock me.
%abramar_closure_c3_73%	Look, a falcon has arrived.
%abramar_closure_c3_74%	Oh, could it be from Théa?
%arbiter_cliffhanger_c3_3%	Ah, Fortuna!
%arbiter_cliffhanger_c3_4%	What is it? What happened?
%arbiter_cliffhanger_c3_5%	It's about your leader.
%arbiter_cliffhanger_c3_6%	...
%arbiter_cliffhanger_c3_7%	What about Aedana!?
%arbiter_cliffhanger_c3_8%	Aedana is dead.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_2%	Mmm... Still no familiars in your window.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_3%	What shall we do, meanwhile?
%abramar_kill_time_c3_4%	I don't know, just wait. It's ok.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_5%	Mmm... bummer. I'm eager for some action.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_6%	What do you do to kill time, you must be an expert at it.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_7%	Usually I just drop myself on the bed and feel sorry for myself.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_8%	But when my mood allows for it I study or enjoy some interactive fiction.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_9%	I've accumulated quite a backlog, and going through it had a lot of weight in keeping me sane during exile.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_10%	Oh, fiction. I'm not a fan of fiction, the universe is already a great purveyor of stories.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_11%	But you go ahead and do some reading, I'll look at the stars or something.
%abramar_kill_time_c3_12%	Yeah, I might.
%funeral_2%	We are reunited here today to say goodbye to our good friend Patrice.
%funeral_3%	She lived intensely and died on her own terms.
%funeral_4%	We are returning her body to the earth, just as she wished:
%funeral_5%	"Naked and covered in flowers. My body to the soil, my soul to my sister. To the stars."
%funeral_6%	You lived in beauty, and depart in beauty.
%funeral_7%	Now, some words from her eldest son.
%funeral_8%	...
%funeral_9%	I’m not good with speeches so excuse my brevity.
%funeral_10%	...
%funeral_11%	I will always be in awe of all the life my mother brought into this world.
%funeral_12%	And I’m not only talking about her numerous children and grandchildren.
%funeral_13%	I’m talking about her words, her ideas, her wisdom.
%funeral_14%	I don't know if any of us will ever achieve the clarity my mother had.
%funeral_15%	With her gone, we’ve lost the brightest light in the universe.
%funeral_16%	I wish any of our dads were decent enough to be half the person our mother was.
%funeral_17%	I wish any of them were brave enough to have stayed by her side.
%funeral_18%	Today I didn't only lose my one true parent, but also my idol.
%funeral_19%	Adios, mamá. Te quiero.
%funeral_20%	...
%funeral_21%	Thank you, Pedro.
%funeral_22%	Now, Mr. Stanton. You wanted to say something too?
%funeral_23%	That's right, thank you.
%funeral_24%	I feel lucky that you’re all letting me be part of this moment.
%funeral_25%	I wanted to share with you how much of an inspiration her family was to her.
%funeral_26%	She always spoke of you so dearly. She loved you more than anything.
%funeral_27%	Patrice could strike you as a cynical person, at first. She always had that "I'm too smart to be wasting my time with you" vibe, haha.
%funeral_28%	But she was ultimately driven by love.
%funeral_29%	Love of life and of the human experience.
%funeral_30%	I've been extremely fortunate to have been her editor for the past twenty years.
%funeral_31%	And I know for a fact that she has been a mother not only to you, but to hundreds of thousands of readers around the globe.
%funeral_32%	Her unique perspective on pleasure and joy has been an inspiration for many women, from many cultures.
%funeral_33%	She's leaving a bleeding wound inside many hearts, but also a legacy.
%funeral_34%	The world is stronger and healthier thanks to her.
%funeral_35%	And that... feeling. That energy will never die.
%funeral_36%	Thank you, Patrice.
%funeral_37%	...
%funeral_38%	Thank you, Mr. Stanton.
%funeral_39%	Now, to proceed with the last rites, I...
%funeral_40%	Wait, I want to speak too.
%funeral_41%	Ah, of course. Go ahead.
%funeral_42%	Grandma...
%funeral_43%	You aren't really gone, are you?
%funeral_44%	That body covered in flowers... you just had to leave that old husk behind, right?
%funeral_45%	We had so many plans, so many ideas...
%funeral_46%	I can't accept that you'd let a stupid cancer take away what we were building together. Right, "yaya"?
%funeral_47%	You haven't betrayed me, have you?
%funeral_48%	Fortuna...
%funeral_49%	It's ok, Pedro. Let her express herself.
%funeral_50%	I can't do this by myself...
%funeral_51%	Did you run off to the stars to look for your sister?
%funeral_52%	You promised you'd take me with you to see the cosmos!
%funeral_53%	If you don't come back right now, I will never forgive you.
%funeral_54%	María, I’m sure your grandmother will keep guiding you from wherever she is.
%funeral_55%	One never truly leaves this world.
%funeral_56%	Patrice's body may turn to dust, Patrice's voice may have gone silent...
%funeral_57%	But her essence is an everlasting gift we will never lose.
%funeral_58%	Patrice... She's broken free from that name.
%funeral_59%	Now we will call her Autumn, we will call her Tears, and Fragrance, a mid-afternoon dream.
%funeral_60%	Enough with the cheesy poetry, already.
%funeral_61%	You will never understand my grandmother, or what we were doing together...
%funeral_62%	María!
%funeral_63%	I am sorry for your loss.
%funeral_64%	Now, if no one has any more words to share, we will return her to the earth.
%funeral_65%	...
%funeral_66%	May your soul bless the stars, Patrice.
%funeral_2_2%	So... My prediction finally came true, eh?
%funeral_2_3%	You managed to live fifty-nine years, eleven months and twenty-one days.
%funeral_2_4%	For a second I believed you'd be able to break free from your fate.
%funeral_2_5%	You remained a tough bitch even in death.
%funeral_2_6%	...
%funeral_2_7%	...
%funeral_2_8%	It's too hard to do this without your witty comebacks.
%funeral_2_9%	...
%funeral_2_10%	I'm sorry I didn't come and visit you after I ascended...
%funeral_2_11%	But time among the stars sure flies...
%funeral_2_12%	And I wasn't sure how you'd deal with the fact your sister became a Witch.
%funeral_2_13%	...
%funeral_2_14%	I'm so sorry.
%funeral_2_15%	That night on the beach, I started walking into the sea and never looked back.
%funeral_2_16%	But somehow you knew, eh?
%funeral_2_17%	You knew I wasn't dead.
%funeral_2_18%	...
%funeral_2_19%	You are the only thing I missed from my time as a mortal.
%funeral_2_20%	It's been tough up there without you.
%funeral_2_21%	...
%funeral_2_22%	What about one last reading? For old times sake?
%spread_funeral_intro_2%	Ah... what should I ask about...?
%spread_funeral_intro_3%	I wonder how our relationship would have been if I had stayed.
%spread_funeral_intro_5%	Do you mind if I indulge, Patrice?
%spread_funeral_intro_6%	...
%spread_funeral_lostlife_6%	You'd have joined my food truck venture. We'd have visited many music festivals and met a lot of friends and lovers.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_7%	That would have been fun, huh?
%spread_funeral_lostlife_8%	Making pizzas, dancing, sunbathing at the most beautiful beaches...
%spread_funeral_lostlife_13%	I'd have married one of your husbands' brothers and we'd have had a big happy family all together.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_14%	We'd help raise each other's children.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_15%	You'd have taught them about love and literature.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_16%	I'd have taught them about magic and pizza, hahaha.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_17%	We'd have enjoyed long summer nights drinking wine with our husbands and friends, watching over the kids playing in the garden...
%spread_funeral_lostlife_22%	We would have run a popular magazine together. With Eva as editor-in-chief.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_23%	We'd have traveled the world interviewing many celebrities.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_24%	We'd have given a voice to many women.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_25%	We'd also have made a lot of people angry with our revolutionary ideas, hahaha...
%spread_funeral_lostlife_30%	We'd have moved to the Canary Islands. You'd have written lesbian pulp novels and I'd have run an online Tarot website.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_31%	We'd have drunk the most delicious wine, and had a small community of artist friends.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_32%	Met some beautiful girls and taken long walks along the beach.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_33%	We'd have grown old together and had long talks swayed by the warm evening breeze...
%spread_funeral_lostlife_37%	Ah... Patrice, I missed you so much.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_38%	I am going to miss you so much...
%spread_funeral_lostlife_39%	What the hell am I doing... reading into the hypothetical.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_40%	How can I be this cowardly? I owe you more than this.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_41%	The first and only time I read into someone's death was for you.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_42%	As a last present I'll get real...
%spread_funeral_lostlife_43%	I'll read beyond your death.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_45%	I'm scared of that presence I found when you dared me to read into your demise.
%spread_funeral_lostlife_46%	It was lurking there, watching us from the unknown...
%spread_funeral_lostlife_47%	I'll look into its eyes now. To see for myself where we're sending you off to.
%spread_funeral_afterlife_6%	You will become an intergalactic detective.
%spread_funeral_afterlife_7%	You'll accept cases from Witches and supernatural beings alike.
%spread_funeral_afterlife_12%	You'll be the founder of the first ever Cosmic Gazette and become a cosmic investigative reporter.
%spread_funeral_afterlife_13%	You'll even interview extra-dimensional beings!
%spread_funeral_afterlife_18%	You will become an archivist of occult texts.
%spread_funeral_afterlife_19%	You'll collect and translate many lost and forbidden texts and keep them safe in a massive five-dimensional library.
%spread_funeral_afterlife_24%	You will become a cosmic cartographer.
%spread_funeral_afterlife_25%	You'll explore this ever-expanding uncharted universe and create maps and devices to help Witches navigate it.
%spread_funeral_followup_2%	Pffft... Ha ha ha, what!?
%spread_funeral_followup_3%	I think I lost my talent. This doesn't make any sense.
%spread_funeral_followup_4%	What in the cosmos am I doing...
%spread_funeral_followup_6%	I'm sorry, Patrice. I'm just spewing nonsense.
%spread_funeral_followup_7%	...
%spread_funeral_followup_8%	Don't leave me...
%funeral_end_2%	Six feet under, my ass.
%funeral_end_3%	Patrice!!!
%funeral_end_2_2%	Fortuna?
%funeral_end_2_3%	What is this?
%funeral_end_2_4%	Is this the... other side?
%funeral_end_2_5%	Why are you in cosplay?
%funeral_end_2_6%	Patrice! I love you!
%funeral_end_2_7%	Ah... I love you, too, silly.
%funeral_end_2_8%	...
%funeral_end_2_9%	Are we ghosts?
%funeral_end_2_10%	Hahaha...
%funeral_end_2_11%	No, Patrice. This is the real world.
%funeral_end_2_12%	I am a Witch.
%funeral_end_2_13%	And... I believe you are one now, too.
%funeral_end_2_14%	Fuck me.
%aedana_2%	Hello, Fortuna.
%aedana_3%	...
%aedana_4%	Is something the matter?
%aedana_5%	I heard you were dead.
%aedana_6%	That is correct.
%aedana_7%	Hmm... You have never met the corpse of a Witch.
%aedana_8%	I keep forgetting how young some of you are.
%aedana_9%	I always thought of death as just that: the end.
%aedana_10%	It can be, if you are killed or erased.
%aedana_11%	But a Witch also dies when they lose the will to live.
%aedana_12%	Now I am but an aimless corpse, waiting to be consumed by your sisters, or to be scattered through the cosmos.
%aedana_13%	Why are you visiting me, then?
%aedana_14%	Think of me as a ghost, dealing with loose ends.
%aedana_15%	In that case... My exile... Is it over?
%aedana_16%	I am afraid it is not. Reviewing sentences now falls upon the next leader of the coven.
%aedana_17%	And who that might be?
%aedana_18%	It is yet to be decided.
%aedana_19%	...
%aedana_20%	I sense something different about you.
%aedana_21%	What have you done?
%aedana_24%	You feel even more pitiful than before.
%aedana_25%	It almost makes me want to forgive you.
%aedana_28%	You feel so intimidating.
%aedana_29%	Is it because I am dead? No...
%aedana_30%	You have done something. You changed yourself.
%aedana_31%	You are dangerous now.
%aedana_34%	You have grown.
%aedana_35%	You feel like an adult Witch, now.
%aedana_36%	It is a shame I did not get to meet you in this form.
%aedana_38%	I don't know what you're talking about.
%aedana_39%	What loose end have you come to tie up here, anyway.
%aedana_40%	You.
%aedana_41%	I want to ask you what you have learned during this brief isolation.
%aedana_44%	Divination can control a community.
%aedana_45%	It's wrong for a single Witch to rule a coven.
%aedana_46%	Exile is not a constructive solution.
%aedana_47%	That you are a bitch.
%aedana_48%	BRIEF!?
%aedana_52%	BRIEF!?
%aedana_53%	Ah... summer flower, a millennium is but a breeze for a Witch.
%aedana_54%	I don't care that you are a boring old geezer, Aedana.
%aedana_55%	A healthy person needs stimulus.
%aedana_56%	You have barely had to spend two centuries by yourself. Do not complain.
%aedana_57%	You will thank me when you are old.
%aedana_58%	I don't think I will.
%aedana_59%	In any case, what have you learned during this period?
%aedana_62%	Divination can control a community.
%aedana_63%	It's wrong for a single Witch to rule a coven.
%aedana_64%	Exile is not a constructive solution.
%aedana_65%	That you are a bitch.
%aedana_69%	Divination can control a community.
%aedana_70%	You wanted me to realize my responsibility, right?
%aedana_71%	Close, but no cigar.
%aedana_72%	It goes much deeper than that.
%aedana_76%	It's wrong for a single Witch to rule a coven.
%aedana_77%	Your word alone shouldn't be enough for me to spend centuries apart from my loved ones.
%aedana_78%	My judgments are not capricious.
%aedana_79%	I converse with the gods.
%aedana_80%	Divine quorum is more important than the clash of personal volitions.
%aedana_81%	Gods shouldn't have a say in what happens to us Witches, either.
%aedana_82%	Nonsense.
%aedana_83%	What was I supposed to learn?
%aedana_87%	Exile is not a constructive solution.
%aedana_88%	The coven should actively work to make Witches understand their mistakes and ensure a healthy coexistence.
%aedana_89%	That path leads to weakness.
%aedana_90%	It is just the opposite. Every Witch should work on herself to make the coven stronger, and not burden it with her shortcomings.
%aedana_91%	Whatever.
%aedana_92%	What was I supposed to learn?
%aedana_96%	That you are a bitch.
%aedana_97%	...
%aedana_98%	Childish.
%aedana_99%	What was I supposed to learn, then?
%aedana_103%	Allow me to explain.
%aedana_104%	You have been wrong all along in calling your talent divination.
%aedana_105%	What is Tarot, then, if not divination?
%aedana_106%	I should tell you about the nature of this universe.
%aedana_107%	The secret of reality.
%aedana_108%	Consciousness is a responsibility. Everything that is sentient modifies the nature of the realm we inhabit.
%aedana_109%	All that has happened, every phenomenon, is only real because it has been perceived.
%aedana_110%	The parts of the universe that have not been measured are yet to be defined.
%aedana_111%	Your arts do not predict events. They define them.
%aedana_112%	Unknowingly, you are shaping what didn't happen in the past, as well as what is yet to happen.
%aedana_113%	You are not a reader.
%aedana_114%	You are a writer.
%aedana_115%	...
%aedana_116%	That is why I exiled you.
%aedana_117%	When you predicted the falling of this coven you were, in actuality, dooming us all.
%aedana_118%	I have worked hard to prevent that omen, and I am still not sure if I have succeeded.
%aedana_119%	Only time will tell.
%aedana_120%	Why are you telling this to me now?
%aedana_121%	Because I am dead.
%aedana_122%	And I deem it better that you become aware of the magnitude of your ability, since I will not be here to protect the coven from you any longer.
%aedana_123%	Why didn't you tell me to begin with?
%aedana_124%	Because I was afraid you would write me off this plane. I am well aware you despise me.
%aedana_125%	Keeping you away from your deck was the only way I could think of to ensure some stability for the coven.
%aedana_126%	Come on... I am not the villain you think I am.
%aedana_127%	Likewise.
%aedana_128%	...Fair enough.
%aedana_129%	Remember, you can manipulate anything that does not exist. The future is the most obvious implication, but...
%aedana_130%	I am also talking about the past.
%aedana_131%	You can alter anything that did not happen.
%aedana_132%	(So, Dahlia's past, then... damn.)
%aedana_133%	The coven is about to go through some turbulent times.
%aedana_134%	I do not think you are mature enough to handle your talent.
%aedana_135%	But it is not in my hands anymore. Do as you please with this knowledge.
%aedana_136%	I understand...
%aedana_137%	Thank you for telling me all this.
%aedana_138%	I have a parting gift.
%aedana_gift_6%	I know many Witches will come to you for guidance in the near future.
%aedana_gift_7%	We cannot fix the immaturity of your character. But I can at least offer you knowledge.
%aedana_gift_9%	Take one of my eyes.
%aedana_gift_10%	It will allow you to see the unseen. It will open the gates to the wisdom of the gods.
%aedana_gift_12%	I pray you use it wisely.
%aedana_gift_13%	You will play a critical role in the fate of the coven.
%aedana_gift_16%	This is too much...
%aedana_gift_17%	I am thankful.
%aedana_gift_21%	This is too much...
%aedana_gift_22%	I can't take this.
%aedana_gift_23%	You don't have a choice.
%aedana_gift_24%	It has been etched into the Cosmic Wheel already.
%aedana_gift_25%	Your only decision is what to do with it.
%aedana_gift_26%	...
%aedana_gift_30%	I am thankful.
%aedana_gift_31%	I will make the most of it.
%aedana_gift_32%	I do not really care, anymore.
%aedana_gift_33%	I will not get to witness any of it.
%aedana_gift_34%	Why are you giving it to me, then?
%aedana_gift_35%	It was etched into the Cosmic Wheel.
%aedana_gift_36%	I can only obey.
%aedana_gift_37%	I see...
%aedana_gift_41%	I also want you to have this.
%aedana_gift_46%	Now that you are aware of the true nature or your talents, you must act to the greatest extent of your powers.
%aedana_gift_47%	We cannot fix the immaturity of your character, but I can offer you the power to own your mistakes.
%aedana_gift_49%	Take one of my trinkets. It was crafted by The Goldblower.
%aedana_gift_50%	These are golden sea shells.
%aedana_gift_51%	They will allow you to draw more energy from your readings.
%aedana_gift_52%	The resonance of the sea shells will also expand the versatility of your arts.
%aedana_superarcana_2%	This is a Super Arcana.
%aedana_superarcana_3%	Any card created with this image will allow you to access more readings than with a regular card.
%aedana_superarcana_4%	How did you...
%aedana_superarcana_5%	Even if you believe me a farce, the gods truly speak to me.
%aedana_superarcana_6%	They told me about the new deck you are crafting.
%aedana_superarcana_7%	This custom deck... it suits your arts better than the limited Tarot.
%aedana_superarcana_8%	So my decision to have you exiled has paid off in the end.
%aedana_superarcana_9%	So what? Do you expect me to thank you?
%aedana_superarcana_10%	I expect nothing. I am dead.
%aedana_superarcana_11%	...
%aedana_superarcana_12%	This will be the last time we speak.
%aedana_superarcana_13%	Do you wish to say anything else to me before my departure?
%aedana_superarcana_16%	Fuck you.
%aedana_superarcana_17%	I hope you burn in Hell.
%aedana_superarcana_18%	Thank you for everything.
%aedana_superarcana_22%	Fuck you.
%aedana_superarcana_23%	...
%aedana_superarcana_27%	I hope you burn in Hell.
%aedana_superarcana_28%	Hell does not exist.
%aedana_superarcana_32%	Thank you for everything.
%aedana_superarcana_33%	You are welcome.
%aedana_superarcana_37%	Anything else?
%aedana_superarcana_40%	I hate you.
%aedana_superarcana_41%	I will make this coven better.
%aedana_superarcana_42%	Know you made many of us miserable.
%aedana_superarcana_46%	I hate you.
%aedana_superarcana_47%	Irrelevant.
%aedana_superarcana_51%	I will make this coven better.
%aedana_superarcana_52%	Good.
%aedana_superarcana_56%	Know you made many of us miserable.
%aedana_superarcana_57%	I made you stronger.
%aedana_superarcana_61%	I will leave now.
%aedana_superarcana_62%	Wait...
%aedana_superarcana_65%	Any last advice?
%aedana_superarcana_66%	I'm happy you're dead.
%aedana_superarcana_67%	I really, really hate you.
%aedana_superarcana_71%	Any last advice?
%aedana_superarcana_72%	No.
%aedana_superarcana_76%	I'm happy you're dead.
%aedana_superarcana_77%	Irrelevant.
%aedana_superarcana_81%	I really, really hate you.
%aedana_superarcana_82%	...
%aedana_superarcana_86%	Goodbye.
%abramar_aedana_2%	Are you alright?
%abramar_aedana_5%	No.
%abramar_aedana_6%	Still processing...
%abramar_aedana_7%	This is great news, actually.
%abramar_aedana_11%	No.
%abramar_aedana_12%	I'm not sure if I'll be able to read the cards anymore...
%abramar_aedana_14%	Why?
%abramar_aedana_15%	This is too much responsibility.
%abramar_aedana_16%	I shouldn't toy with people's fates. Or even worse, their pasts.
%abramar_aedana_17%	I concede you that messing with the past is somewhat unsettling.
%abramar_aedana_19%	But the future? Pfft.
%abramar_aedana_20%	Aren't we all messing with each other's lives all the time, anyway?
%abramar_aedana_22%	You just happen to have the upper hand.
%abramar_aedana_23%	I don't know...
%abramar_aedana_24%	More than that, as the sole possessor of this talent you have the responsibility to use it.
%abramar_aedana_25%	You have the power to change this universe for the better.
%abramar_aedana_27%	Own it.
%abramar_aedana_28%	Maybe you have a point there...
%abramar_aedana_30%	Some individuals lead covens, some others run societies, some beings can eat whole galaxies...
%abramar_aedana_31%	I mean, I have the power to grant wishes.
%abramar_aedana_32%	Own your talents, Fortuna.
%abramar_aedana_33%	...
%abramar_aedana_34%	You're right.
%abramar_aedana_35%	But these cards... it's not like I have total control over the readings.
%abramar_aedana_36%	There's chance involved in the shuffling.
%abramar_aedana_37%	What if a card only offers me tragic outcomes?
%abramar_aedana_38%	You'll have to face some tough decisions, sure. But that's just like the rest of us. Sometimes there are no good outcomes.
%abramar_aedana_39%	You have a talent for putting a spin on dire situations, don't you?
%abramar_aedana_41%	Hahahahaha.
%abramar_aedana_43%	I've found myself stuck between a rock and a hard place too many times.
%abramar_aedana_44%	I have a knack for looking on the bright side... for my own sake.
%abramar_aedana_46%	That's really human of you.
%abramar_aedana_47%	Or that's really Behemoth of humans. I was here first.
%abramar_aedana_48%	As I said, a true reality spinner.
%abramar_aedana_49%	Aedana told you, reality is modified by consciousness. I may be a master of that, hahaha.
%abramar_aedana_53%	Still processing...
%abramar_aedana_57%	This is great news, actually.
%abramar_aedana_58%	Is it?
%abramar_aedana_59%	Absolutely.
%abramar_aedana_60%	Imagine if I kept using our deck without understanding the implications.
%abramar_aedana_61%	Now we can use it properly. To turn the tide in our favor.
%abramar_aedana_63%	Hahahahahaha.
%abramar_aedana_65%	I thought you'd be more anxious about the weight of your actions from now on.
%abramar_aedana_66%	I mean, I'm a bit worried about the readings I've done in the past.
%abramar_aedana_71%	Hell, I caused the rise of that AI that's now ruling planet Earth.
%abramar_aedana_74%	Hell, I made almost all of humanity digitize themselves and go exist inside computers.
%abramar_aedana_77%	Hell, I sent all humans to live confined in domed cities.
%abramar_aedana_80%	Hell, I unleashed that superbacteria that decimated the population of Earth.
%abramar_aedana_83%	Hell, I triggered humanity's colonization of the stars.
%abramar_aedana_85%	And I toyed with the past and future of my friends.
%abramar_aedana_86%	However...
%abramar_aedana_87%	Now I can own my talents and help shape a better universe for us all.
%abramar_aedana_89%	What if you draw a card that only offers bad omens?
%abramar_aedana_90%	Mmm... you're right. I'll have to be more careful with how I build my deck from now on.
%abramar_aedana_91%	The stakes are really high. But there's also a lot of promise, now that I'm aware of the potential repercussions.
%abramar_aedana_94%	In any case, I may need some time before I feel ready to read the cards again.
%abramar_aedana_95%	Nonsense.
%abramar_aedana_96%	I need you back in the game as soon as possible.
%abramar_aedana_97%	Do you want me to look into what was bothering you, then?
%abramar_aedana_99%	Ah... Well...
%abramar_aedana_102%	Come on, do it for me. Please?
%abramar_aedana_103%	It's alright, I won't push you...
%abramar_aedana_104%	(KNOWLEDGE) Is it about Gloria, The First Witch?
%abramar_aedana_108%	Come on, do it for me, please.
%abramar_aedana_109%	Now that I know your game isn't just divination, I'm not so sure about leaving such a delicate topic in your hands.
%abramar_aedana_112%	I promise to look for the best outcome.
%abramar_aedana_113%	Are you scared?
%abramar_aedana_117%	I promise to look for the best outcome.
%abramar_aedana_118%	Still...
%abramar_aedana_122%	Are you scared?
%abramar_aedana_123%	Yes.
%abramar_aedana_124%	Oh... This isn't like you, Ábramar.
%abramar_aedana_125%	We're past the bullshit zone in our relationship.
%abramar_aedana_126%	I'd rather leave what's worrying me to chance.
%abramar_aedana_130%	It's alright, I won't push you...
%abramar_aedana_131%	Thank you.
%abramar_aedana_134%	I'll tell you what, let's put your talent to work in service of more immediate benefits.
%abramar_aedana_135%	What about altering the coven's relationship with Behemoths now that Aedana is gone?
%abramar_aedana_137%	Mmm... That's not a bad idea.
%abramar_aedana_138%	But what if what we find in the cards isn't good?
%abramar_aedana_139%	I don't think there's anything worse than being forbidden and hunted.
%abramar_aedana_140%	You're right.
%abramar_aedana_141%	Ok, let's put this deck to use.
%abramar_aedana_146%	Is it about Gloria, The First Witch?
%abramar_aedana_148%	!
%abramar_aedana_149%	How did you...
%abramar_aedana_150%	It's Aedana's eye...
%abramar_aedana_151%	Or better said, it's the Water contract we sealed together... It already activated.
%abramar_aedana_152%	It's offering me knowledge.
%abramar_aedana_153%	I can't fully access it. It feels like a waterfall of ideas behind my mind.
%abramar_aedana_154%	And sometimes something jumps out the water.
%abramar_aedana_155%	So... You wanted to ask about Gloria.
%abramar_aedana_157%	That's right.
%abramar_aedana_158%	Gloria is my first love.
%abramar_aedana_159%	I spent many universes without loving a single being.
%abramar_aedana_160%	Suddenly, she came into existence... or better put, she ascended.
%abramar_aedana_161%	Gloria is the first woman who left the mortal plane behind and became a Witch.
%abramar_aedana_162%	She is the inventor of magic... which is basically exploiting a universe's rules.
%abramar_aedana_163%	Ah... I've never met a single entity as full of love and ideas as Gloria.
%abramar_aedana_164%	And I had the privilege of being loved by her.
%abramar_aedana_165%	...
%abramar_aedana_166%	I wanted to ask you what had become of her.
%abramar_aedana_167%	Before, I was afraid of what I'd find. But now I'm afraid of what you'd write.
%abramar_aedana_171%	Now I'm not even sure if she truly existed, since you read about her when you crafted your first cards.
%abramar_aedana_172%	You could well have brought her into existence with that reading.
%abramar_aedana_173%	Whoa, that'd be too much. I mean, writing the very origin of Witches myself would be too paradoxical.
%abramar_aedana_174%	Maybe not that, but the fact that she loved me.
%abramar_aedana_175%	...I see.
%abramar_aedana_176%	It doesn't change anything, in any case.
%abramar_aedana_177%	You may be right.
%abramar_aedana_179%	I promise I will look for the best possible reading... or writing.
%abramar_aedana_180%	Ah... Alright.
%abramar_aedana_181%	I granted you this deck. We might as well go all the way in.
%abramar_aedana_182%	I got you, partner.
%abramar_aedana_184%	Also, while you're at it, what do you say we try and reshape the coven's stance on Behemoths?
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_2%	Let's see...
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_3%	We want to look into how the coven deals with Behemoths...
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_5%	Right.
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_7%	And then we will look into what's worrying you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_8%	No. I told you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_9%	That's not going to happen.
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_10%	Alright. I had to try one last time.
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_11%	Shuffling time.
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_15%	And let's see what has become of Gloria, The First Witch.
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_17%	Please, let it be something good...
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_18%	I'll do my best.
%spread_coven_behemoth_intro_19%	The rest is in the hands of the deck.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_6%	Behemoths and Witches will get to coexist in harmony.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_7%	That is...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_9%	DELICIOUS.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_11%	I can't believe it's going to be as easy as that.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_12%	You are the most terrifying Witch I've ever met.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_13%	A single sentence to solve all our problems.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_14%	I still have trouble picturing this actually happening.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_15%	It feels weird now, being aware that whatever comes out of my mouth will come true.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_16%	Although it's always been like that, I guess...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_17%	What were the other options?
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_18%	I'd rather not say. Feels like I'd corrupt the reading if I reveal them.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_19%	Understood.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_21%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_22%	This means a lot to me.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_23%	Not once in the history of this universe has anyone ever done so much for a Behemoth.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_24%	This wasn't just for you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_25%	Peaceful coexistence will be good for everyone.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_27%	Of course.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_28%	I am thankful anyway.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_29%	You're welcome.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_34%	The coven will relax their policies regarding Behemoths and will judge them on a case by case basis.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_35%	As it should be with anyone.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_36%	No sentient being should be persecuted by default.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_37%	You could still be judged as dangerous, though.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_38%	I'm ok with that, I guess.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_39%	All I ever asked for is a fair opportunity.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_40%	I know I can prove myself useful to any community.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_41%	It feels weird now, being aware that whatever comes out of my mouth will become true.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_42%	Although it's always been like that, I guess...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_43%	What were the other options?
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_44%	I'd rather not say. Feels like I'd corrupt the reading if I reveal them.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_45%	Understood.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_47%	And hey...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_48%	Thank you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_49%	You're welcome.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_51%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_56%	A Witch from our coven will develop a magical trinket to enslave Behemoths.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_58%	I can't believe you just did that.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_59%	Why in the cosmos would you read that?
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_60%	Take it back. Now.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_61%	I'm sorry. I don't think I can.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_62%	Even if I have my personal preferences, these cards seem to have a will of their own.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_63%	I may be the writer, but the deck is my muse.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_64%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_66%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_67%	We were aware of the risks before I did the reading.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_68%	I understand.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_69%	...There were any other options?
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_70%	I'd rather not say. It feels like I'd corrupt the writing if I reveal them.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_72%	That's fine by me. You can't jinx it any further.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_73%	I'm afraid it doesn't work like that. I'm sorry.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_74%	I can't risk corrupting fate now that I know I'm shaping it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_75%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_76%	It serves me right.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_77%	No more divination for me. Keep that deck away from me, please.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_78%	Understood.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_86%	Don't you want to know about Gloria, at least?
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_88%	NO.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_89%	I won't put her fate in your hands.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_90%	I don't trust you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_91%	I'm sorry...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_93%	Now get that thing away from me.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_100%	Behemoths are too dangerous and they will always be forbidden.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_102%	You...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_103%	Why would you write that?
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_104%	I'm not sure... Even if I have my personal preferences, these cards seem to have a will of their own.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_105%	I may be the writer, but the deck is my muse.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_106%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_108%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_109%	We were aware of the risks before I did the reading.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_110%	I understand.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_111%	...Were there any other options?
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_112%	I'd rather not say. It feels like I'd corrupt the writing if I reveal them.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_114%	Ah... Whatever.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_115%	Back to square one.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_116%	As I said, it couldn't get any worse. At least we tried.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_117%	Thank you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_118%	Maybe it wasn't meant to be. Behemoths are a force to reckon with.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_119%	And you can't fix eons-long hatred with a single card, I guess.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_120%	You're right.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_121%	Don't worry about it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_126%	You, Ábramar, will get to rule this coven.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_128%	HAHAHAHAHAHA!
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_130%	That is magnificent!
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_131%	So bold of you to go with that reading.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_132%	We've been ruled by a Witch who allegedly hears the voices of gods in her head for an absurd amount of time.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_133%	We might as well have an almighty Behemoth as our leader for the next season.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_135%	HAHAHAHAHAHA!
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_137%	So bold! So bold!
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_139%	I like it. You won't regret it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_140%	I'll take good care of you Witches, I promise.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_141%	I'll write you off this cosmos if you dare become a tyrant, though.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_144%	Don't be so serious.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_145%	I will do my best, I swear it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_146%	You'd better.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_150%	That is, if you get to witness it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_151%	Remember that for the Fire seal you paid with your immortality.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_152%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_154%	You oughta play your cards better, my love.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_155%	Ábramar.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_157%	Sorry, sorry.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_158%	I was just teasing you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_159%	Thanks for trusting me with the direction of the coven.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_160%	I will take care of you sisters.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_161%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_165%	In any case, you offered the coven as payment in the Fire contract.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_166%	So this is just like sealing the deal.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_167%	Maybe you saved them.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_168%	Because it could well have meant that the coven would disappear.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_169%	Now you've left it in good hands.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_170%	Well played.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_171%	Don't make me regret it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_172%	Don't worry.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_173%	Thanks for trusting the direction of the coven to me.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_174%	I will take care of you sisters, and you, of course.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_176%	Don't make me regret it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_177%	Don't worry.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_178%	Thanks for trusting the direction of the coven to me.
%spread_coven_behemoth_covenandbehemoths_179%	I will take care of you sisters, and you, of course.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_7%	You will be reunited with Gloria and will get to rekindle the passion of your relationship.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_9%	Is...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_10%	Is that true?
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_11%	I'm certain. I wrote so, haha.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_12%	I can't believe it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_13%	I thought I would never get to meet her again... let alone get to experience her love.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_14%	Aaaw...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_15%	Thank you so much, Fortuna.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_17%	I am in your debt.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_18%	I turned out to be the wish granter in the end, huh?
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_19%	And without shady contracts.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_21%	Hahahahaha.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_23%	The student always surpasses the master, they say.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_24%	Hahaha.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_26%	Thank you so much.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_27%	My pleasure.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_32%	You will never get to meet Gloria again... but you will find a love greater than hers.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_34%	Not even your talent is powerful enough to allow me to see her again, huh...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_36%	And a love greater than Gloria's?
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_37%	That sure sounds like fiction.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_38%	You just wait. The Cosmic Wheel doesn't ever stop turning, Ábramar.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_39%	I can't picture an experience more intense than what I had with Gloria.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_40%	But you've managed to poison this extra dimensional being with hope.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_41%	Thank you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_42%	My pleasure.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_47%	You will meet Gloria again, but it is with her corpse that you'll get to speak one last time.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_49%	How you dare kill her, Witch.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_50%	I will never forget this.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_51%	Ábramar!
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_52%	Don't get mad at me, please.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_53%	This is where our deck guided me, and Gloria has lived for eons.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_54%	It's only natural her flame will wither.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_55%	I don't care. She was meant to be eternal.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_56%	She is your maker, you ungrateful animal.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_57%	Ábramar, please.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_58%	You will get to see her one last time.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_59%	She will come to say goodbye.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_60%	Everything is going to be alright.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_62%	I just love her so much...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_63%	I only wanted her to be happy. I didn't care if I never got to see her again...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_64%	Now you've doomed her...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_65%	Everything, always, is meant to vanish.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_66%	Not us Behemoth.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_67%	We are cursed to be witnesses of entropy.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_68%	Why... Fortuna...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_69%	Why did you have to read... to write this.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_70%	I'm sorry.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_71%	We Witches don't age, but we can die.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_72%	In a reality full of endless possibilities, we are bound to end.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_73%	I guess you're right...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_74%	Gloria...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_75%	Be strong.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_77%	Don't.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_78%	Do not pity me.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_79%	You can't understand.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_80%	Serves me right for putting Gloria's fate in the hands of a being this young...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_81%	Let's move on.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_86%	Gloria will never love you again, but you will get to meet her one more time. She has a parting gift for you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_88%	Is that so...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_89%	It makes sense, though, for a being as magnificent as her to leave me behind.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_90%	Not even your talent is powerful enough to get her to love me again, huh...
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_92%	I'll celebrate that I'll get to see her one last time, in any case.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_93%	I can't wait to discover what that parting gift is going to be.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_94%	It's so strange, to see you this vulnerable.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_95%	This Gloria must be a force of nature.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_96%	Gloria is what makes existing in this universe worthwhile.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_97%	You wouldn't understand.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_98%	What her ascension has meant to the whole of reality... You are all here because of her.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_99%	Maybe you'll grasp a fraction of her might if you get to speak with her.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_100%	I'm looking forward to it.
%spread_coven_behemoth_gloria_101%	Thanks for the reading...
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_2%	Mmm...
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_3%	Your deck feels way more dangerous now.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_4%	I doubt I'll ever subject myself to your divination again.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_5%	In all the universes I've existed in, nothing has ever made me feel so fragile.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_6%	You must use these powers wisely. I beg of you.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_7%	Whoa, I never expected to get a Behemoth to beg.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_8%	This is serious, indeed.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_10%	It's not a laughing matter, Fortuna.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_11%	Hey, don't look at me, you're the one who's always teasing when it comes to life or death issues.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_12%	Got a taste of my own medicine, huh...
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_13%	Now I see it's not funny.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_14%	Please, accept my apologies.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_15%	Come on, don't be so uptight. I've got your back.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_16%	Sure...
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_17%	...
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_18%	Look. You've got mail.
%spread_coven_behemoth_followup_19%	Right. Let's see.
%jasmine_race_2%	Hello, Fortuna.
%jasmine_race_4%	I come with terrible news...
%jasmine_race_5%	I don't know how to say it.
%jasmine_race_6%	Aedana is dead.
%jasmine_race_8%	You knew already!
%jasmine_race_11%	An Arbiter told me.
%jasmine_race_12%	I just met with Aedana's corpse.
%jasmine_race_16%	An Arbiter told me.
%jasmine_race_17%	Oh yeah?
%jasmine_race_18%	How so?
%jasmine_race_19%	She's following my case, and deemed it important to let me know.
%jasmine_race_21%	So the Arbitrage Office is still looking into your case?
%jasmine_race_23%	I'm glad to hear that!
%jasmine_race_25%	And how are you handling the news?
%jasmine_race_28%	I'm shocked, to be honest.
%jasmine_race_29%	I celebrate that the coven is rid of her.
%jasmine_race_33%	I'm shocked, to be honest.
%jasmine_race_34%	Yes, this is going to be a tough blow for the coven...
%jasmine_race_38%	I celebrate that the coven is rid of her.
%jasmine_race_40%	Fortuna!
%jasmine_race_41%	Why do you have to be like that?
%jasmine_race_42%	A fellow Witch is dead.
%jasmine_race_43%	She was a tyrant. Things will change for the better now, I'm sure of it.
%jasmine_race_45%	Actually, about that...
%jasmine_race_49%	I just met with Aedana's corpse.
%jasmine_race_50%	Is that true!?
%jasmine_race_51%	What did she want?
%jasmine_race_52%	She was... dealing with loose ends.
%jasmine_race_54%	Did she lift your sentence?
%jasmine_race_55%	Hah... I wish.
%jasmine_race_56%	She was only trying to justify herself. To leave this universe in peace, I guess...
%jasmine_race_57%	Poor Aedana...
%jasmine_race_58%	My exile is now in the hands of whoever gets to rule next.
%jasmine_race_59%	Mmm... About that...
%jasmine_race_63%	The first order of business is to decide how to deal with Aedana's corpse.
%jasmine_race_66%	What do you mean?
%jasmine_race_68%	There's an incredible amount of magic stored inside Aedana's corpse.
%jasmine_race_69%	And now it's up to the coven to decide how to handle it.
%jasmine_race_70%	One option is to devour her, so every Witch in our coven becomes stronger.
%jasmine_race_71%	The other option is to scatter her remains throughout the cosmos, so more Witches can ascend. That way our clan could almost double in size.
%jasmine_race_74%	Yeah, Dahlia was here a couple of minutes ago and she brought me up to speed.
%jasmine_race_76%	Ah, good.
%jasmine_race_77%	So basically, we have to decide whether to be fewer but stronger, or weaker but more diverse.
%jasmine_race_79%	What's your stance on this?
%jasmine_race_80%	I believe we should devour her.
%jasmine_race_81%	Changing government and all, I believe that it's just not the best time to receive that many new trainees.
%jasmine_race_82%	There's already enough turmoil in having to establish a new direction.
%jasmine_race_83%	We need to be stronger than ever for the sake of our sisters.
%jasmine_race_84%	I see...
%jasmine_race_85%	And speaking of that...
%jasmine_race_87%	I'm running for leader!
%jasmine_race_89%	Oh, congratulations, and good luck!
%jasmine_race_90%	Thank you, I thought the coven could use some tender loving care after Aedana.
%jasmine_race_91%	That is true.
%jasmine_race_94%	Yeah, so I heard!
%jasmine_race_95%	Girl, you are well informed for being isolated on this asteroid.
%jasmine_race_96%	Ah... What can I say?
%jasmine_race_97%	Anyway, I thought the coven could use some tender loving care after Aedana.
%jasmine_race_100%	Will you help me with your divination, Fortuna?
%jasmine_race_103%	Can I count on your support?
%jasmine_race_106%	Tell me about your program first.
%jasmine_race_107%	Of course I'll help you.
%jasmine_race_108%	Sorry, but no.
%jasmine_race_109%	I can't. I already promised Dahlia I'd help her.
%jasmine_race_115%	Tell me about your program first.
%jasmine_race_117%	Ah! But of course! Sorry.
%jasmine_race_119%	Right now there are five pillars in the ruleset of our coven:
%jasmine_race_120%	Judgment, Law Enforcement, Forbidden Arts, Mortal Affairs, and Witch Duties.
%jasmine_race_122%	Judgment is about how we deal with conflicts within the coven, how we determine who's at fault and such.
%jasmine_race_123%	It's also the executive branch, tackling where the coven is going and how we deal with major events.
%jasmine_race_125%	Right now we have Runic Judgment. Basically, it was Aedana consulting with the gods.
%jasmine_race_126%	I believe we shouldn't leave Witch Law in the hands of exogenous forces.
%jasmine_race_127%	My proposal is that Judgment should be in the hands of the oldest four members of the coven, in agreement with the leader.
%jasmine_race_129%	So, any judgment should come by quorum of the five wisest Witches.
%jasmine_race_130%	Then there's Law Enforcement.
%jasmine_race_132%	Right now Witches who put the coven in jeopardy are sent to exile for a variable amount of time depending on the severity of their actions.
%jasmine_race_134%	And it’s truly horrible!
%jasmine_race_136%	My proposal here is that Witches accumulate warnings depending on the severity of their transgressions...
%jasmine_race_138%	And eventually, should they fail to change their behavior, they will be expelled from the coven.
%jasmine_race_139%	No Witch should endure what you're going through, Fortuna.
%jasmine_race_140%	Letting Witches go to find a new coven that's a better fit is a more humane solution, in my opinion.
%jasmine_race_141%	Then there's the Forbidden Arts.
%jasmine_race_142%	That's how we deal with hazardous magic and knowledge, such as summoning Behemoths, necromancy, and so on.
%jasmine_race_144%	Right now, when the coven determines something could put our community at risk, we ban it.
%jasmine_race_145%	And I believe it should stay that way, so no changes on that front for my part.
%jasmine_race_146%	Next point: Mortal affairs.
%jasmine_race_147%	That's how we deal with humans and... other "lesser beings."
%jasmine_race_149%	Aedana determined that mortals should be exploited and manipulated for Witches' convenience.
%jasmine_race_150%	I don't like that at all.
%jasmine_race_151%	I don't believe any soul to be a lesser being, to begin with.
%jasmine_race_153%	I believe we have the responsibility to protect and guide mortal societies.
%jasmine_race_154%	We have the power to better their lives, so we must do so.
%jasmine_race_155%	And last, but not least, there are the Witch Duties.
%jasmine_race_156%	That defines what members' obligations to the coven are.
%jasmine_race_158%	Right now we have the infamous quarterly controls... and should a Witch fail to deliver, they'll eventually lose their membership.
%jasmine_race_160%	I propose a policy of zero vigilance. To trust that a member of our coven will always strive to better our community.
%jasmine_race_161%	Contribution should be at every Witch's own pace and discretion.
%jasmine_race_162%	Oh! There's also the issue regarding what to do with Aedana's corpse.
%jasmine_race_164%	I say we should devour her and become stronger.
%jasmine_race_165%	That basically sums it up.
%jasmine_race_166%	What do you think?
%jasmine_race_172%	Of course I'll help you.
%jasmine_race_174%	Yaaaay! Hahahaha.
%jasmine_race_176%	Thank you Fortuna!
%jasmine_race_179%	My pleasure!
%jasmine_race_182%	I already feel more confident with you on my side!
%jasmine_race_185%	Dahlia asked me first, but I'll switch sides.
%jasmine_race_186%	I'll be helping Dahlia too, though.
%jasmine_race_187%	My pleasure!
%jasmine_race_192%	Dahlia asked me first, but I'll switch sides.
%jasmine_race_194%	Oh my... Will that be ok? I don't want to cause any problems.
%jasmine_race_195%	Don't worry. I prefer to support you, that's all.
%jasmine_race_196%	I'd rather stay honest when it comes to politics.
%jasmine_race_197%	Ah... ok, ok.
%jasmine_race_199%	Glad to hear you're on my side!
%jasmine_race_203%	I'll be helping Dahlia too, though.
%jasmine_race_205%	Oh...
%jasmine_race_206%	Shouldn't you be supporting just one cause?
%jasmine_race_207%	There's gonna be many conflicts of interest here...
%jasmine_race_208%	Mmm...
%jasmine_race_209%	I believe either of you would make an excellent leader.
%jasmine_race_210%	I don't see a problem in offering counsel to the both of you!
%jasmine_race_211%	Mmm... ok.
%jasmine_race_212%	But for now... Who has your vote?
%jasmine_race_215%	You.
%jasmine_race_216%	Dahlia.
%jasmine_race_217%	I'd rather not say.
%jasmine_race_218%	I still don't know.
%jasmine_race_222%	You.
%jasmine_race_224%	Ah... That makes me so happy!
%jasmine_race_225%	Thank you!
%jasmine_race_226%	No problem.
%jasmine_race_227%	Ok, what now?
%jasmine_race_229%	Mmm...
%jasmine_race_233%	Dahlia.
%jasmine_race_234%	Oh... I see...
%jasmine_race_235%	Why?
%jasmine_race_238%	I just like her program better. Nothing personal.
%jasmine_race_241%	I don't know... Instinct.
%jasmine_race_243%	Oh...
%jasmine_race_246%	Well, I'll do my best during the campaign to win you over!
%jasmine_race_247%	Haha, that's the spirit.
%jasmine_race_248%	So, what now?
%jasmine_race_249%	Mmm...
%jasmine_race_253%	I'd rather not say.
%jasmine_race_255%	Ah! Of course, how rude of me to ask you so directly.
%jasmine_race_257%	Whatever you decide will be ok!
%jasmine_race_259%	Although, I sure hope you vote for me, hehehe...
%jasmine_race_260%	Hahaha.
%jasmine_race_262%	Let's see now...
%jasmine_race_266%	I still don't know.
%jasmine_race_267%	Ah, of course. This isn't an easy matter.
%jasmine_race_271%	Ok! The first order of business is to assess the risks and opportunities ahead of me!
%jasmine_race_272%	I was hoping to consult with your deck.
%jasmine_race_273%	Absolutely. Let's put these cards to good use.
%jasmine_race_279%	Sorry, but no.
%jasmine_race_287%	HUH!? Why not!?
%jasmine_race_290%	I'd rather not mess with politics.
%jasmine_race_291%	Your program isn't up my alley.
%jasmine_race_292%	I can't. I already promised Dahlia I'd help her.
%jasmine_race_296%	I'd rather not mess with politics.
%jasmine_race_298%	Oh... come on.
%jasmine_race_299%	Don't think of it as politics but as helping a friend!
%jasmine_race_300%	It's politics all the same.
%jasmine_race_301%	But this is important!
%jasmine_race_302%	It's precisely because it's important that I'd rather not tamper with it.
%jasmine_race_303%	...
%jasmine_race_304%	Ok, I respect your decision.
%jasmine_race_306%	Mmm...
%jasmine_race_308%	Listen, there's someone I would like you to meet.
%jasmine_race_309%	Maybe she'll make you more sympathetic to our cause.
%jasmine_race_310%	Junreisha, the Mathematician Witch.
%jasmine_race_311%	She also believes we should devour Aedana and become stronger.
%jasmine_race_312%	Junreisha is the oldest and wisest Witch in our coven, after Aedana.
%jasmine_race_313%	I'm sure she can make a strong case for why we should absorb our former leader's corpse.
%jasmine_race_314%	Sure, tell her to pay me a visit.
%jasmine_race_315%	For now, I should be leaving. There are a lot of people I need to meet to get my campaign in motion.
%jasmine_race_317%	Take care!
%jasmine_race_318%	Do your best!
%jasmine_race_324%	I can't, I already promised Dahlia I'd help her.
%jasmine_race_326%	Oh... Is that true?
%jasmine_race_327%	I wasn't aware she came to you first, I'm sorry.
%jasmine_race_329%	Well, it's important to keep one's word, so I won't insist.
%jasmine_race_330%	But this doesn't mean I won't try to win you over. There's a lot of campaigning still to come!
%jasmine_race_331%	In fact...
%jasmine_race_335%	Your program isn't up my alley.
%jasmine_race_337%	Ah... fine.
%jasmine_race_339%	You don't have to make up your mind right now.
%jasmine_race_340%	But I'll work hard during the campaign so I can gain your trust and your vote!
%spread_jasmine_race_intro_2%	Let's see...
%spread_jasmine_race_intro_3%	Risks and opportunities it is.
%spread_jasmine_race_intro_6%	That's right.
%spread_jasmine_race_intro_7%	Meditate on your strong points and ponder what could go wrong while I shuffle the cards.
%spread_jasmine_race_intro_8%	Alright.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_6%	There won't be any major difficulties in your path.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_8%	Wow! Really!?
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_9%	Yup, crystal clear.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_10%	Yaaay! I'm gonna win this race!
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_11%	I wouldn't go that far.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_13%	Oh, well... of course.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_14%	But right now a smooth campaign is all I can ask for.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_15%	The rest is in my hands.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_16%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_17%	My pleasure.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_22%	One of your biggest supporters will change sides and sweep a lot of votes away from you.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_24%	Oh, no! Who's it gonna be?
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_25%	That, I don't know.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_26%	Just keep an eye on your closest advisors.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_27%	Oh, no, no...
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_28%	I don't want to become paranoid right off the bat.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_29%	That won't do any good, no.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_30%	I guess trust is a key element in a political race.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_31%	My advice is that you don't overthink it and just brace yourself for when the moment comes.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_32%	Being aware of the possibility might alleviate the shock, yes.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_34%	I'll be vigilant. Thank you.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_35%	Stay strong, friend.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_40%	You will have a big fight with Dahlia that will leave you emotionally exhausted.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_42%	Ah... I was kinda bracing myself for that already.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_43%	I know she plans on running for leader too.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_44%	I'll do my best to make sure our friendship survives, but things are about to get pretty intense.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_45%	I'm sorry, Jasmine. I'll be here for the both of you, as always.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_47%	Thank you, Fortuna. That means a lot.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_48%	This won't be the first time I patch things up between you two, eh?
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_50%	Hahaha, you're right.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_52%	You are the best.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_53%	Stay strong, friend.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_58%	You will be blamed for a tragedy and it will make you lose many votes.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_60%	Oh, no...
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_61%	Will it be my fault?
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_62%	I don't know, but that's irrelevant. You will be blamed nonetheless.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_63%	So better prepare as is if you were going to fuck up.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_65%	Ok, ok. I will be strong.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_66%	One would expect that you might have to deal with some foul play during a race, in any case.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_67%	I'll be vigilant and prepare to turn the tide in my favor when needed.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_69%	Hang in there, Witch.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_72%	Will this happen before or after I solve that important crisis with my flower magic?
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_74%	Because depending on the order, it could be a tale of redemption, or a tale of corruption...
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_75%	I can't really tell.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_76%	That's up to the Cosmic Wheel.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_77%	Ah... ok.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_79%	Time to craft some good old luck charms, then.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_80%	I wish you best of luck.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_85%	During the most trying of times you will lose faith in yourself and your leadership will suffer for it.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_87%	Ah... Why does that not surprise me?
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_88%	That is my biggest concern, to be honest.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_89%	A political race promises to be tough, to say the least.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_90%	I don't know if I'm strong enough to survive this, Fortuna...
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_91%	Why did I have to put myself through this...
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_92%	Well... the campaign hasn't even started.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_93%	You don't have to expose yourself to it.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_94%	Why don't you let any of your other sisters take the wheel?
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_95%	...
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_97%	No.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_98%	I just can't let this whole thing go.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_99%	I know deep in my heart that I can do a lot of good for this coven.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_100%	And that's what's important.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_101%	There's your answer, then.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_102%	You'll be just fine, even if you have to endure some rough patches.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_104%	You're right. I must stay determined!
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_105%	And... I hope you'll be there whenever I need to be picked up?
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_106%	Always.
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_107%	Thank you, Fortuna...
%spread_jasmine_race_risks_108%	Stay strong, Jasmine.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_6%	Your flower magic will solve an important crisis that will gain you many sympathies.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_9%	Oh, wow!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_10%	What kind of crisis? I sure hope it doesn't hurt any of our sisters!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_11%	You're a saint.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_12%	In any case, you'll be the hero of the day!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_15%	That's nice and all, but the safety of the coven comes before harvesting votes.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_16%	I will keep you all safe.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_17%	Haha, that's our Jasmine.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_21%	One thing though...
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_23%	Will this happen before or after that major fuck up I'll be blamed for?
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_24%	Because it'll play very differently… it could become a tale of redemption or a tale of corruption.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_25%	That I can't tell, sorry...
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_26%	It's up to the Cosmic Wheel.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_27%	Ah... ok.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_29%	Time to craft some good old luck charms, then.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_30%	I wish you best of luck.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_34%	Hey! Could this be related to that cosmic plague you predicted I'd cure thanks to my garden?
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_35%	Mmm... Now that you mention it, it's pretty probable, yeah.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_36%	Cheer up! You'll become our hero!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_41%	The oldest Witches will help you influence many of the newcomers.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_43%	Oh! That's great news!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_44%	Having the youngest behind me is good.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_45%	But it puts my mind at ease knowing I'll have support of the wisest Witches in our clan.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_47%	If I become leader, I want to create a board of advisors, and there's no better wisdom than experience!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_48%	I'm happy for you, congratulations.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_49%	Thank you! I'm really looking forward to this race!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_50%	Best of luck!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_55%	Should you choose to betray someone close to you, you will gain many votes.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_57%	Oh, no! Please don't say that!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_58%	I would never betray anyone!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_59%	Well, the reading gave it as an opportunity you can choose to seize.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_60%	It's not... mandatory.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_61%	Thank the cosmos...
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_62%	The temptation will be overwhelming, though.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_63%	I doubt the deck would bring it up if it wasn't a likely path.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_64%	I will etch in my spirit to resist such foul play.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_66%	Do not betray, Jasmine. Do not betray. Do. Not. Betray.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_67%	Whatever happens, I'm sure you'll have your reasons.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_68%	Don't torture yourself so much.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_69%	No!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_70%	Do. Not. Betray.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_71%	Ok, ok... I wish you strength, then.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_73%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_78%	Your chances of success will increase if you turn towards a more conservative position.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_79%	Mmm...
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_80%	I thought I was playing it safe enough with my program.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_81%	But I will think about keeping some of Aedana's stricter policies...
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_82%	Please, don't let it be anything regarding exile.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_83%	Don't put any other sister through what I'm going through...
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_84%	Ok, ok. I promise.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_85%	What then... Mortal affairs? Witch duties...?
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_86%	...
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_87%	Don't worry, I'll always keep the wellbeing of the coven in mind.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_88%	Sure...
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_93%	The Arbitrage Office will support your cause.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_95%	Oh! That is excellent news!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_96%	Being fully recognized by the Arbitrage Office is an essential step in consolidating power.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_98%	If the Arbitrage Office endorses my program I'm sure we'll gather many supporters from the coven and outsiders alike.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_99%	I will contact them promptly.
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_100%	Thanks a lot for the advice, Fortuna!
%spread_jasmine_race_opportunities_101%	My pleasure.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_2%	All right. Alea jacta est.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_4%	Indeed.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_5%	Predictions aside... There's a difficult race ahead, that's for sure.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_6%	Thanks a lot for your counsel, my friend.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_7%	You just let me know if I can help in any other way.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_8%	Will do.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_9%	Mmm...
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_10%	By the way, there's someone I would like you to meet.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_11%	Junreisha, the Mathematician Witch.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_12%	She also believes we should devour Aedana and become stronger.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_13%	Junreisha is the oldest and wisest Witch in our clan, after Aedana.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_14%	She can make a strong case for why we should absorb our former leader's corpse.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_15%	It would mean a lot to me if you heard what she has to say.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_16%	Sure, tell her to pay me a visit.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_17%	Ok! I should be leaving now. There are a lot of people I need to meet to get my campaign in motion.
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_19%	Take care!
%spread_jasmine_race_followup_20%	Do your best!
%dahlia_race_4%	AEDANA IS DEAD!!
%dahlia_race_5%	Hahahaha.
%dahlia_race_6%	FUCK AEDANA!!!
%dahlia_race_7%	Hahahahahaha.
%dahlia_race_9%	Hahahahaha!!
%dahlia_race_11%	Let's go out and celebrate!
%dahlia_race_12%	Nooooo... I can't!
%dahlia_race_14%	Why not!?
%dahlia_race_15%	That hag is out, fuck rules!
%dahlia_race_16%	My freedom is in the hands of whoever becomes the next leader.
%dahlia_race_18%	Then I'll become leader. My first order of business will be to ban fucking exile!
%dahlia_race_19%	Hahaha, I wish.
%dahlia_race_21%	No, I mean it!
%dahlia_race_22%	I'm running for office, Fortuna.
%dahlia_race_24%	Oh, wow. Really?
%dahlia_race_27%	Yeah, I heard from Jasmine, actually.
%dahlia_race_29%	I can't picture you running the coven, to be honest.
%dahlia_race_30%	I thought you despised that kind of responsibility.
%dahlia_race_33%	It promises to be a pain in the ass, yeah.
%dahlia_race_36%	Well, I'd been planning on leaving the coven and starting my own clan of warrior Witches.
%dahlia_race_37%	Now here's an opportunity to change the direction of our community without having to abandon you all.
%dahlia_race_38%	It won't be a coven of warriors, but I sincerely believe I can make life better for all of our sisters.
%dahlia_race_41%	Yeah... But you know I was planning on overthrowing Aedana.
%dahlia_race_42%	Got cold feet in the end. But this is a great opportunity to change things without resorting to violence.
%dahlia_race_44%	We've endured too many centuries of abusive leadership.
%dahlia_race_46%	I'm determined to revitalize our clan!
%dahlia_race_47%	Follow me, and I shall deliver freedom and happiness!
%dahlia_race_48%	Hahaha, you're even more energetic than usual.
%dahlia_race_50%	Hahahaha, I'm rarin' to go!
%dahlia_race_53%	FORTUNA! JOIN ME! LET'S RULE THE COVEN TOGETHER.
%dahlia_race_56%	Ah... Why don't you tell me about your plans first?
%dahlia_race_57%	HELL YEAH, I'M IN.
%dahlia_race_58%	I must painfully decline...
%dahlia_race_59%	I can't... I already promised Jasmine I'd help her.
%dahlia_race_65%	Ah... Why don't you tell me about your plans first?
%dahlia_race_67%	Hahahaha, of course, of course...
%dahlia_race_69%	Sorry, I got caught up in the moment.
%dahlia_race_70%	Don't you think I'm a dumb Witch. I have a solid plan.
%dahlia_race_71%	I've done some research and the five pillars of our coven's law are...
%dahlia_race_73%	Judgment, Law Enforcement, Forbidden Arts, Mortal Affairs, and Witch Duties.
%dahlia_race_74%	Judgment is how we decide who fucked up and what to do with the coven.
%dahlia_race_75%	Law Enforcement is how we punish those who fucked up.
%dahlia_race_76%	Forbidden Arts is how we deal with dangerous stuff.
%dahlia_race_77%	Mortal Affairs is how we deal with people, animals, and everything non-magical.
%dahlia_race_78%	Witch Duties is basically what every sister has to do for the coven.
%dahlia_race_79%	Now... Aedana was basically all: fuck you, I rule; fuck you, I exile you; fuck dangerous stuff; fuck mortals; and well... fuck you.
%dahlia_race_85%	I want to change things radically. Try a new system. More open and inclusive.
%dahlia_race_86%	Judgment will be something held between all members of the coven.
%dahlia_race_87%	All important issues will be solved after hearing everyone's input, then celebrating a referendum.
%dahlia_race_89%	It's feasible since our coven has less than a hundred members right now.
%dahlia_race_90%	There won't be Law Enforcement. All issues will be solved amicably between the affected parties.
%dahlia_race_91%	Uh… isn't that a bit naive? What if they can't reach an agreement?
%dahlia_race_92%	We'll submit the case to the Arbitrage Office. I don't see why we need additional enforcement since we have the Magical Pact already.
%dahlia_race_94%	I see...
%dahlia_race_95%	Following that line of thought, there won't be any Forbidden Arts.
%dahlia_race_96%	I believe that banning things begets temptation.
%dahlia_race_97%	It's better to share knowledge and educate Witches about its implications.
%dahlia_race_99%	Then about Mortal Affairs... I believe we should cut all ties with mortals.
%dahlia_race_101%	This may seem radical, but I believe we are way too privileged to dare tamper with human lives.
%dahlia_race_102%	I say leave them be. We have a whole universe to toy with.
%dahlia_race_103%	As for Witch Duties... Instead of asphyxiating quarterly controls, I say we set a magical tax to pool resources for the coven.
%dahlia_race_105%	Any Witch could go about her life however she wants provided she shares a proportional part of the magic she draws from the cosmos.
%dahlia_race_106%	We'll use those resources to help newcomers or any sister in need. Or to develop some ambitious communal project.
%dahlia_race_107%	That basically sums it up.
%dahlia_race_110%	Oh!
%dahlia_race_111%	There's a pressing matter too!
%dahlia_race_112%	We have to decide how to deal with Aedana's corpse.
%dahlia_race_113%	We can either devour her or scatter her throughout the cosmos.
%dahlia_race_114%	Come again?
%dahlia_race_117%	Apparently, there's a lot of magic stored inside the corpse of a Witch.
%dahlia_race_118%	If we literally eat her, we'll all become more powerful.
%dahlia_race_119%	But if we free her magic, a lot of women will be able to ascend and become Witches. We could almost double our numbers!
%dahlia_race_121%	I firmly believe we should share her magic with the universe. We may become more powerful should we devour her...
%dahlia_race_122%	But there's a special strength hidden in diversity.
%dahlia_race_123%	More points of view and the clash of new wills will make us grow in more interesting ways!
%dahlia_race_126%	And what about devouring or freeing Aedana's corpse?
%dahlia_race_128%	Ah shit! you are well informed. Almost forgot about that.
%dahlia_race_131%	That pretty much sums up my stance. So...
%dahlia_race_133%	ARE YOU WITH ME!?
%dahlia_race_136%	HELL YEAH, I'M IN.
%dahlia_race_137%	I must painfully decline...
%dahlia_race_138%	I can't... I already promised Jasmine I'd help her.
%dahlia_race_144%	HELL YEAH, I'M IN.
%dahlia_race_146%	THAT IS FUCKING FANTASTIC, FORTUNA.
%dahlia_race_149%	We can do this!
%dahlia_race_153%	I swear I'm gonna be the best leader this coven has ever seen.
%dahlia_race_156%	Jasmine asked me first, but I'll switch sides.
%dahlia_race_157%	I'll be helping Jasmine too, though.
%dahlia_race_158%	We can do this!
%dahlia_race_163%	Jasmine asked me first, but I'll switch sides.
%dahlia_race_164%	Oh... that's likely to open some wounds.
%dahlia_race_165%	She'll have to understand.
%dahlia_race_166%	I feel better leaving the clan in your hands.
%dahlia_race_167%	I'd rather stay honest when it comes to politics.
%dahlia_race_168%	I respect that.
%dahlia_race_172%	I'll be helping Jasmine too, though.
%dahlia_race_174%	What!? You plan on playing both sides?
%dahlia_race_175%	Don't be upset.
%dahlia_race_176%	I just believe either of you two would make an excellent leader.
%dahlia_race_177%	I'll support you both with my divination and let the coven decide where to put their trust.
%dahlia_race_178%	...
%dahlia_race_180%	That's fair, I guess.
%dahlia_race_185%	Ok, cards! Am I going to win!?
%dahlia_race_186%	Hahaha, wow, hold your horses, Dahlia.
%dahlia_race_187%	That question may be too heavy.
%dahlia_race_190%	Why? Jasmine is planning on running for office too. Let's clear things up so we can save ourselves the pain of a campaign.
%dahlia_race_191%	If you want to solve this by shuffling a deck you might as well meet with Jasmine and flip a coin.
%dahlia_race_192%	And none of that would do. Voters are going to need a campaign to be informed, at the very least.
%dahlia_race_193%	Ah... sure. We can still do the theater if necessary. But I'd rather know who's gonna win already to dispel all the anxiety.
%dahlia_race_194%	I refuse. That would be unfair to Jasmine.
%dahlia_race_195%	Better think of a different question.
%dahlia_race_196%	Ok, ok, I get it...
%dahlia_race_197%	Mmm... What to ask...
%dahlia_race_203%	I must painfully decline...
%dahlia_race_211%	What? Why?
%dahlia_race_214%	I'd rather not mess with politics.
%dahlia_race_215%	Your program isn't up my alley.
%dahlia_race_216%	I can't. I already promised Jasmine I'd help her.
%dahlia_race_220%	I'd rather not mess with politics.
%dahlia_race_221%	Urgh... I know, I know.
%dahlia_race_222%	I'm not even sure why I'm getting myself into this mess to begin with.
%dahlia_race_224%	I respect your decision. No hard feelings!
%dahlia_race_225%	Thanks for being so understanding.
%dahlia_race_227%	In any case, I hope you vote when the day comes.
%dahlia_race_229%	One of the things that matters the most to me is how we deal with Aedana's corpse.
%dahlia_race_232%	What's that?
%dahlia_race_233%	Apparently, there's a lot of magic stored inside the corpse of a Witch.
%dahlia_race_234%	The dilemma is whether to devour her or to scatter her magic throughout the cosmos.
%dahlia_race_235%	If we literally eat her, we'll all become more powerful.
%dahlia_race_236%	But if we free her magic, a lot of women will be able to ascend and become Witches. We could almost double our numbers!
%dahlia_race_239%	Yeah, Jasmine already brought me up to speed on that.
%dahlia_race_240%	It's basically a matter of devouring her to become more powerful or freeing her magic so more Witches can ascend, right?
%dahlia_race_241%	That's right.
%dahlia_race_243%	I believe it is extremely important that we open the gates for more women to become Witches.
%dahlia_race_244%	And because of that, I'd love it if you met with our most recent addition to the community.
%dahlia_race_246%	She's so new she doesn't even have a name yet!
%dahlia_race_248%	Please, let her come to see you. You can help her find her way.
%dahlia_race_249%	And you'll get to see how diversity will make our coven richer, too.
%dahlia_race_250%	It'll be my pleasure. Tell her to come whenever she's ready.
%dahlia_race_252%	Thank you so much!
%dahlia_race_253%	I'll be going now. I need to start putting a team together to deal with the campaign.
%dahlia_race_254%	See you!
%dahlia_race_255%	Bye, Dahlia.
%dahlia_race_260%	Your program isn't up my alley.
%dahlia_race_262%	Ah... is that so?
%dahlia_race_263%	What exactly do you disagree with?
%dahlia_race_266%	The referendum thing looks troublesome.
%dahlia_race_267%	Disregarding Law Enforcement seems unwise.
%dahlia_race_268%	Giving free access to Forbidden Arts.
%dahlia_race_269%	Cutting all ties with mortals.
%dahlia_race_270%	I don't like the tax on magic.
%dahlia_race_271%	We should devour Aedana.
%dahlia_race_272%	Most of it, to be honest.
%dahlia_race_276%	The referendum thing looks troublesome.
%dahlia_race_277%	It'll make the Judgment process unwieldy. We won't be able to respond swiftly to crises.
%dahlia_race_278%	Mmm... You may be right. I'll give it some thought.
%dahlia_race_282%	Disregarding Law Enforcement seems unwise.
%dahlia_race_283%	Fuck policing our sisters, Fortuna!
%dahlia_race_284%	I believe all Witches to be good by nature.
%dahlia_race_285%	What about Aedana?
%dahlia_race_286%	Huh... good point.
%dahlia_race_287%	Mmm... You may be right. I'll give it some thought.
%dahlia_race_291%	Giving free access to Forbidden Arts.
%dahlia_race_292%	It sounds too dangerous!
%dahlia_race_293%	Come on! Don't be such a hypocrite!
%dahlia_race_294%	You yourself helped Grethe to deal with that Behemoth!
%dahlia_race_295%	I'm in favor of helping fellow Witches deal with their fuckups...
%dahlia_race_296%	But Forbidden Arts are called that for a reason...
%dahlia_race_297%	I disagree with you, but I'll try to change your mind during the campaign.
%dahlia_race_301%	Cutting all ties with mortals.
%dahlia_race_303%	All beings are wonderful and there's a lot to learn from mortality.
%dahlia_race_304%	Ah... That's a valid point of view, yes.
%dahlia_race_305%	Mmm... I'll give it some thought.
%dahlia_race_308%	You yourself had a son. Your granddaughters wouldn't exist if we weren't allowed to mingle with mortals.
%dahlia_race_309%	Ah... Maybe it's because I know that pain that I believe it's wisest to cut all ties with them.
%dahlia_race_310%	In any case, you didn't cause them any harm.
%dahlia_race_311%	Yeah, maybe. But still...
%dahlia_race_312%	I get your point, though.
%dahlia_race_316%	I don't like the tax on magic.
%dahlia_race_317%	What? Come on! Don't be so greedy!
%dahlia_race_318%	Redistributing power is a wonderful thing!
%dahlia_race_319%	I'd rather help my sisters on my own terms.
%dahlia_race_320%	I disagree with you, but I'll try to change your mind during the campaign.
%dahlia_race_324%	We should devour Aedana.
%dahlia_race_325%	Absolutely not. I won't yield on this.
%dahlia_race_329%	Most of it, to be honest.
%dahlia_race_330%	Really...?
%dahlia_race_331%	Right now I'm not sure whether to be disappointed in you or in myself, to be honest...
%dahlia_race_332%	But something is off, that's for sure.
%dahlia_race_333%	I hope you at least agree that we should make our coven more diverse.
%dahlia_race_337%	Setting our differences aside, I hope you at least agree that we should make our coven more diverse.
%dahlia_race_341%	I can't. I already promised Jasmine I'd help her.
%dahlia_race_342%	Oh, wow, really?
%dahlia_race_343%	I didn't know, I'm sorry.
%dahlia_race_344%	Tough luck, I guess.
%dahlia_race_345%	I respect loyalty, so if you're already compromised I'm fine with it.
%dahlia_race_346%	I'll just have to work harder to beat you two, heheh...
%dahlia_race_347%	I'm truly sorry.
%dahlia_race_349%	Don't be! It's ok, really!
%dahlia_race_351%	But there's one issue I must insist on.
%spread_dahlia_race_intro_3%	Oh! I know!
%spread_dahlia_race_intro_4%	Who are my enemies going to be?
%spread_dahlia_race_intro_6%	And what kind of dagger should I forge to face these trying times?
%spread_dahlia_race_intro_8%	Whoa, playing hardball, are we?
%spread_dahlia_race_intro_10%	The future of the coven is on the line.
%spread_dahlia_race_intro_11%	Let's pull out the artillery.
%spread_dahlia_race_intro_13%	Understood.
%spread_dahlia_race_intro_14%	Focus on your warrior spirit while I shuffle the cards.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_6%	An Arbiter is going to be on your tail, scrutinizing every move you make.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_8%	The fucking Witch police!?
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_9%	Why in the cosmos?
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_10%	All my shit is above board, they've got nothing on me.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_11%	For some reason, they're going to be watching you, so I suggest you play your cards as safely as possible.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_12%	I've got nothing to be ashamed of!
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_13%	Politics can get way less... honorable, than your usual Daemon hunting.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_14%	You just act with as much virtue as possible and everything will be fine.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_15%	But nonetheless, it promises to be a nuisance.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_16%	Just associating with an exile like me could put you under suspicion.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_18%	Well, they can suck my ass.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_19%	Ah... please, watch yourself.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_21%	Yes, yes, don't worry so much.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_22%	I'll keep things lawful good from now on…
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_28%	Jasmine will pose the biggest threat to your campaign.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_29%	Yeah, she's running for leader too. Thanks a lot, captain obvious.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_30%	Well, take this reading as "don't underestimate Jasmine."
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_31%	I'd never, Jasmine is a formidable opponent.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_32%	But sure, I'll keep it in mind.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_33%	I'll step up my game.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_34%	Good.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_39%	A powerful Behemoth will stand in your way.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_40%	I sure hope it isn't Grethe's.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_42%	And I also hope that bastard is a free agent and not a being summoned by a Witch.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_43%	Because I'd definitely report that bitch's ass to the Arbitrage Office this time.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_44%	I thought you were no snitch.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_46%	The game has changed.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_47%	We're not talking a desperate Witch looking for solace.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_49%	If I find out that someone's playing dirty and using a Behemoth to alter the elections I'll hunt her myself.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_50%	Oh, wow, haha... I wouldn't want to be in that Witch's shoes.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_52%	Well, if it happened to be a friend of mine I would never report her, of course.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_54%	But I'd be very, very angry!
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_55%	Haha...
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_57%	Are you hiding something?
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_58%	Nope.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_63%	The oldest Witches will conspire against you.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_65%	I knew it! Those hags are gonna hate my program!
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_66%	And I know they're already salivating at the thought of devouring Aedana's corpse.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_71%	Over my dead body!
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_73%	Well, strike that, because they'd definitely eat me, too, hahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_75%	I hope those old bastards don't try to play dirty, for their own good.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_77%	Else they're about to meet the wrath of a warrior Witch.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_78%	Hahaha, nice to see you all fired up.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_80%	They won't subdue me.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_84%	Wait, what? Eating Aedana?
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_85%	Oh! Right. I didn't tell you about that.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_86%	One of the key points in this election will be whether to absorb Aedana's corpse or to scatter her remains.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_87%	Eating her body, literally, will make us all stronger. We'll absorb her magic.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_88%	But if we free her power to the universe, more women will be able to ascend and become Witches.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_89%	This is very important to me. I believe there's strength not only in numbers but in diversity.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_90%	But those greedy Witches want to have our leader for breakfast.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_95%	Patrice, my sister, will make a strong case against you becoming the next leader.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_96%	What? Your sister?
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_97%	She barely interacts with the community. What does she care about politics?
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_98%	Yeah... this reading surprised me, too...
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_99%	She'll have her reasons, I'm sure.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_100%	And you'd better watch yourself, because she's smart and relentless.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_102%	Damn, things got exciting all of a sudden!
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_103%	Aren't you scared?
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_104%	Hell yeah, but I wouldn't want it any other way.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_106%	I hunt Daemons for a living. Having a challenge to look forward to is just like fuel to my huntress engines.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_107%	Ah... I'm happy for you, then!
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_108%	But I'm definitely still scared.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_110%	Don't worry, I won't hurt her.
%spread_dahlia_race_enemies_111%	It's not her that I'm worried about, haha...
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_6%	Courage. Craft a dagger and infuse it with the valor to do whatever needs to be done.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_8%	Right up my alley.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_9%	One can never have enough courage.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_11%	Let's pray that "whatever needs to be done" isn't something too tragic, though.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_12%	Thank you.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_17%	Wisdom. Forge a dagger that channels knowledge.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_19%	I work better with instinct than with wisdom, hahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_21%	So that's why this is probably good advice.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_23%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_28%	Cunning. Smith a blade to discern lies.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_30%	Oooh! That's a great idea!
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_32%	Politics promise to be way more intricate than the hunting grounds.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_33%	I'm not used to dealing with subterfuge.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_34%	Thanks a lot for pointing me in the right direction.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_39%	Presence. Make yourself a dagger that inspires respect.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_41%	THAT'S IT!
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_42%	Great idea, Fortuna!
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_43%	I'd say you're intimidating enough as you are, I don't know if this is gonna be overkill, hahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_45%	Hahahaha, shut up! I'm not intimidating, I'm just... intense.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_46%	That's a bit of an understatement, but you do you, Witch. Hahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_48%	Will do. Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_53%	Resilience. Infuse the handle with it so the dagger can withstand your grip during these trying times.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_55%	Resilience. Understood.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_56%	...
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_58%	What does resilience mean, exactly? Hahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_59%	Hahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_60%	The ability to recover swiftly from a bad situation... more or less.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_62%	Oh, so cool! Let's crank the resilience to 14, then.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_64%	Thanks a lot, Fortuna.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_65%	For the idea and for teaching me about the concept, hah.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_70%	Love. An edgeless dagger.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_72%	Hahaha, isn't a "Love Dagger" a bit of an oxymoron?
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_73%	Hahaha, maybe.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_75%	I think it is important to produce a trinket that reminds you of the true purpose of your quest.
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_77%	That is so cool!
%spread_dahlia_race_dagger_79%	Thank you so much, I won't lose my way. I promise.
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_2%	Mmm...
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_3%	What's the matter?
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_8%	Not to undermine your craft, but... I doubt a dagger will be enough to deal with Patrice. She can be a formidable opponent.
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_11%	Not to undermine your craft, but... I doubt a dagger will be enough to keep an Arbiter in check.
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_14%	Not to undermine your craft, but... I doubt a dagger will suffice against Jasmine. She promises to be a formidable opponent.
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_17%	Not to undermine your craft, but... I doubt a dagger will be enough to deal with the oldest Witches. They can easily outsmart us.
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_20%	Not to undermine your craft, but... I doubt a dagger will be enough to fight off a Behemoth.
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_22%	What do you say we draw an extra card to explore what measures to take, given this predicament?
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_23%	Absolutely, lay it on me.
%spread_dahlia_race_check_0_25%	Alright, here we go.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_6%	Make a demonstration of power before the coven. Extend an official duel challenge.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_12%	Whoa, against Patrice? That's bold.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_14%	I know I'm way older, but she's so smart I wouldn't even know how to face her...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_16%	I like it!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_17%	She's so smart I can picture her coming up with a way of declining the duel and making you look bad in the process.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_18%	But if the cards suggested it, it's because there's an opportunity to make a name for yourself with this.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_20%	I'll take my chances. Sounds super fun.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_21%	Hahaha, go and enjoy yourself, then.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_22%	Looking forward to it!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_26%	A duel against an Arbiter!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_27%	That's unprecedented! So cool!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_29%	Are they even supposed to accept duels?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_30%	I don't know, but since the cards brought it up it's likely to happen.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_32%	Damn, the campaign got way more interesting all of a sudden.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_34%	Thank you!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_38%	Whoa, Fortuna. Are you telling me to fight Jasmine!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_39%	Ah... I'm sorry, that might not be a good idea...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_41%	What are you saying?! It's a terrific idea!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_43%	I mean, it doesn't need to be a fight to death or anything like that!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_44%	Just some healthy competition, keeping sportsmanship in mind.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_45%	I always wanted to cross swords--or flowers, whatever--against her, but she wouldn't even agree to spar.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_47%	This is a perfect opportunity to make my wish come true!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_48%	Hahaha, well, you go and enjoy it, then.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_50%	Yes! Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_53%	A duel? Against... all of the old Witches?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_54%	Hahaha, that sounds harsh.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_55%	Maybe just extend an open challenge and tell them to bring their meanest.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_57%	Go to the tallest bully and hit them in the face!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_58%	It's so primal! I love it!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_59%	Hahaha. It doesn't sound very diplomatic, but I'd say it suits you.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_61%	Hahahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_63%	I didn't know elections could be this thrilling.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_65%	I'll do just that. Thank you!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_69%	...a duel!? Against a Behemoth!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_70%	Can those things even be beaten?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_71%	It is possible, I know that for a fact.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_73%	Whaaat? Have you ever beaten one!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_74%	Hahahaha, no!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_75%	But I met some that were beaten more than once.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_77%	Well, it doesn't matter. I'm all horny for that duel now.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_78%	Defeating a Behemoth before the whole coven, I'd support the shit out of whoever did that.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_80%	This is a wonderful idea!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_82%	Thank you, Fortuna!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_87%	Rally the youngest Witches against your opponent.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_93%	Hahahaha, are you telling me to bully your sister?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_94%	Hahaha, she's a bully herself so she had it coming.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_96%	It's not my style to pit some people against others... but I guess that's politics for you.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_97%	She's not gonna show any mercy.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_98%	And isn't politics about persuasion? Maybe you can use the support of the masses to discredit her.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_99%	Still sounds dirty to me.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_100%	But I'd better start changing my mentality if I want to do well in this race.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_101%	That's good advice, thank you.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_105%	Oooh! That's a cool picture!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_106%	Gather the punkiest Witches and fuck the police!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_107%	Hahaha, that sounds unwise, but if anyone is able to turn something that bold into their favor, it's you.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_109%	Hahaha, yeah, don't worry, I'll make sure no one gets hurt.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_110%	This promises to be fun!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_112%	Thanks for the advice!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_115%	Aw... poor Jasmine, I wouldn't want to bully her.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_116%	She's probably going to cater to the more conservative members of the coven, so combating that with the power of youth looks extremely effective to me.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_117%	Mmm... that's going to polarize the race, to say the least.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_118%	But you may be right.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_119%	I'll do that. Thank you, Fortuna!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_123%	Hags versus punks!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_124%	I love it!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_125%	And we can beat them in passion and determination! I'm sure!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_126%	This is going to be one hell of a race.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_128%	Hahaha, totally.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_130%	I confess I was worried these elections would bore me to death.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_131%	So this is great news, actually.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_132%	Thank you, Fortuna!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_136%	Wow! To lead the youngest Witches in fending off a Behemoth!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_137%	That is brilliant! It would make a great display of the newcomers' potential!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_139%	That's sure to tip the balance in our favor.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_141%	Wonderful idea, Fortuna. Thank you!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_146%	Dig up some dirt and report it to the Arbitrage Office.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_152%	Fortuna! How could you even suggest that!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_153%	Firstly, I'm no snitch.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_154%	But more importantly... GIVE UP YOUR OWN SISTER!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_155%	But the cards...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_157%	FUCK THE CARDS!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_159%	You get a reading like that, you don't even say it out loud.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_160%	What would you have me do instead...?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_162%	Whatever! Lie to me if necessary!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_164%	Fuck fate and fuck the Cosmic Wheel if you think I'm gonna sell out Patrice.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_166%	Ah... I'm so sorry, Dahlia. Forgive me, please.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_167%	...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_169%	Of course I forgive you.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_170%	Sorry for lashing out.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_171%	But don't ever suggest something like that to me again. Please.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_172%	Understood. Loud and clear.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_175%	Whoa, that's low.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_176%	But even if I went down that route... can an Arbiter be dirty?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_177%	Of course they can, they're Witches just like the rest of us.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_178%	Most of them are Arbiters because they broke the Magical Pact to begin with.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_179%	You're right...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_180%	Well, I'll try to avoid it, but I won't hesitate to sell out that Arbiter if they become a nuisance.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_181%	They're the ones trying to dig up dirt on me in the first place.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_182%	So giving them a taste of their own medicine will be poetic.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_183%	Hah, sure.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_186%	Fortuna! How could you even suggest that!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_187%	Firstly, I'm no snitch.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_188%	But more importantly... GIVE UP OUR FRIEND TO THE ARBITERS!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_189%	But the cards...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_191%	FUCK THE CARDS!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_193%	You get a reading like that, you don't even say it out loud.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_194%	What would you have me do instead...?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_196%	Whatever! Lie to me if necessary!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_198%	Fuck fate and fuck the Cosmic Wheel if you think I'm gonna sell out Jasmine.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_201%	Uh... that's low.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_202%	But those old hags have been around so long they're bound to have a couple of skeletons in their closet.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_203%	I'll try to avoid stooping to that level...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_204%	But I can warn them that I would go to the Arbiters to try and stop them playing dirty in the first place.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_205%	I won't hesitate to denounce them if they play tricks on me, though.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_206%	Very reasonable.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_209%	Heh... that sure seems like a swift way to take a Behemoth out of the picture.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_210%	Again, I hope it's not a Witch that summoned them, so I won't be selling a sister out to the Arbiters.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_211%	But still, they'd have it coming should they choose to play that card.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_212%	Haha... You may be right...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_213%	I won't ever sell out a friend, though. Don't worry.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_214%	I promise.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_215%	...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_220%	You will be powerless against such a rival.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_221%	Fantastic, thanks a lot, deck. Very useful.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_222%	I guess I don't stand a chance, then.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_223%	Mmm... I wouldn't go that far.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_224%	I'd say that this card is suggesting you don't waste time coming up with countermeasures.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_225%	Stick to your own program and put your efforts into becoming the best possible candidate.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_227%	Oh, that sounds honorable. I like it.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_229%	That's good advice. Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_234%	Make a pact with a Daemon to sabotage your opponents' efforts.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_237%	A PACT WITH A DAEMON!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_238%	That is preposterous, Fortuna!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_239%	I've dedicated my whole existence as a Witch to hunting them down!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_244%	And all to pit it against your sister Patrice!? Have you lost it!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_246%	Ah... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_247%	Just bear in mind that if you ever get to a desperate point, this would be a pretty effective solution.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_248%	You can easily end the Daemon after it's achieved its purpose.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_249%	Still, that is repugnant.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_250%	I apologize.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_251%	I'm just laying out your best option here.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_252%	...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_254%	Ok, ok... sorry for lashing out.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_255%	I'm not sure that the leadership is so important to me that I'd stoop as low as asking for the help of a Daemon.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_256%	But I'll keep it in mind in case I have to make a last stand for whatever reason.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_257%	Thank you...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_260%	And to send it after the Arbitrage Office?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_261%	I might as well become a Witch terrorist.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_262%	Ah... I don't know. Maybe the pact doesn't need to be aggressive in nature.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_263%	You could task the Daemon with sabotaging the Arbiter's investigation or something.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_265%	It's a Daemon, Fortuna!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_266%	You can kill it after you're done with it.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_267%	...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_269%	Ah... whatever, you don't seem to understand.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_270%	I'll keep it in mind should the race become exceptionally gruesome.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_271%	So, thanks... I guess.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_274%	And to pit it against our dear friend Jasmine!? Are you out of your mind!?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_277%	And to send it after our older sisters?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_278%	They might be a bunch of uptight soreheads, but they don't deserve that!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_279%	Ah... I don't know. Maybe the pact doesn't need to be aggressive in nature.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_280%	You could task the Daemon with spying on their plans or something.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_283%	Well, if you command it to fight the Behemoth, no matter who falls it'll be a win anyway, don't you think?
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_284%	You could use the opportunity to end whoever survives, since they'd be weakened after the battle.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_285%	...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_287%	I confess that would be a spectacle worth witnessing, hahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_289%	On second thought, this is a super cool idea, Fortuna.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_290%	Thanks for making me think out of the box.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_291%	Hahah... glad you appreciate the idea.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_294%	Mmm...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_295%	I could ask my dear for help...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_296%	Oh, right! You were dating a Daemon!
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_298%	Don't call it "dating!" It sounds ridiculous, hahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_299%	Hahahaha.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_301%	This might be a great opportunity to present my love to society...
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_302%	Maybe if they become useful for the coven it'll make my relationship look less... heretical.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_303%	I'll remind you that it's not forbidden to love a Daemon.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_304%	Still, as a Daemon huntress I need that validation for myself, I guess.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_305%	Your relationship is already valid, but suit yourself.
%spread_dahlia_race_measures_306%	Thank you, my friend.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_2%	And that's a wrap.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_4%	I hope this was useful to you.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_5%	Well... I'd have preferred to cut to the chase and see who was going to win.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_6%	But this'll have to do. Thanks a lot for taking the time.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_7%	My pleasure.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_8%	Before I leave, I wanted to ask you for another favor.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_9%	What's up? Another friend of yours summon a Behemoth?
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_11%	Hahaha, no, silly.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_13%	One of the things that matters to me the most is how we deal with Aedana's corpse.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_17%	What's that?
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_18%	Apparently, there's a lot of magic stored inside the corpse of a Witch.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_19%	The dilemma is whether to devour her or to scatter her magic throughout the cosmos.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_20%	If we literally eat her, we'll all become more powerful.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_21%	But if we free her magic, a lot of women will be able to ascend and become Witches. We could almost double our numbers!
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_24%	Yeah, Jasmine already brought me up to speed on that.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_25%	It's basically a matter of devouring her to become more powerful or freeing her magic so that more Witches can ascend, right?
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_26%	That's right.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_28%	I believe it is extremely important that we open the gates for more women to become Witches.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_29%	And because of that, I'd love it if you met with our most recent addition to the community.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_31%	She's so new she doesn't even have a name yet!
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_33%	Please, let her come to see you. You can help her find her way.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_34%	And you'll get to see how diversity will make our coven richer, too.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_35%	It'll be my pleasure. Tell her to come whenever she's ready.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_37%	Thank you so much!
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_38%	I'll be going now. I need to start putting a team together to deal with the campaign.
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_39%	See you!
%spread_dahlia_race_followup_40%	Bye, Dahlia.
%abramar_race_followup_3%	Ah... the fresh smell of political turmoil.
%abramar_race_followup_4%	Rejoice, Fortuna! This is the perfect scenario to, quite literally, play our cards.
%abramar_race_followup_6%	Hahahahaha!
%abramar_race_followup_7%	Things could get messy from this point on, yeah.
%abramar_race_followup_9%	How do you feel about politics?
%abramar_race_followup_12%	A necessary pain in the ass.
%abramar_race_followup_13%	I enjoy political discussion.
%abramar_race_followup_14%	I'd rather keep politics out of my games.
%abramar_race_followup_18%	A necessary pain in the ass.
%abramar_race_followup_19%	Yeah, I see how they could become suffocating for a mortal.
%abramar_race_followup_20%	Too many hows and whys.
%abramar_race_followup_21%	I think it's important to stay in touch to a degree if you don't want to be insensitive to the status of your community.
%abramar_race_followup_22%	But I sure hate many things about it.
%abramar_race_followup_24%	Hahahahaha, I get it.
%abramar_race_followup_28%	I enjoy political discussion.
%abramar_race_followup_29%	Oh!
%abramar_race_followup_31%	It'll come in handy then, to do away with the boredom that's been haunting you these two centuries.
%abramar_race_followup_32%	You bet.
%abramar_race_followup_36%	I'd rather keep politics out of my games.
%abramar_race_followup_38%	Oh...
%abramar_race_followup_39%	My analysis so far didn't indicate you were so dumb.
%abramar_race_followup_40%	Eh!? What was that!?
%abramar_race_followup_42%	HAHAHAHAHAHA.
%abramar_race_followup_44%	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
%abramar_race_followup_46%	In any case, you can't take politics out of anything done by humans, my friend.
%abramar_race_followup_47%	Politics are a characteristic of human action. Everything that has a purpose bears intention.
%abramar_race_followup_48%	And intention is political.
%abramar_race_followup_49%	How you represent stuff, how it's going to affect your peers, what elements of your culture you imbue in your work and words...
%abramar_race_followup_50%	You can choose to ignore it, but you can't remove it from the human experience.
%abramar_race_followup_51%	Alright, alright...
%abramar_race_followup_56%	What are your plans for these elections, then?
%abramar_race_followup_70%	Why did you switch over to Jasmine? Will that be ok with Dahlia?
%abramar_race_followup_73%	Dahlia feels too naive.
%abramar_race_followup_74%	I like Jasmine's program better.
%abramar_race_followup_75%	Jasmine is better suited to lead.
%abramar_race_followup_76%	I don't know, instinct.
%abramar_race_followup_80%	Dahlia feels too naive.
%abramar_race_followup_83%	I like Jasmine's program better.
%abramar_race_followup_86%	Jasmine is better suited to lead.
%abramar_race_followup_90%	Why did you switch over to Dahlia? Will that be ok with Jasmine?
%abramar_race_followup_93%	Jasmine isn't strong enough.
%abramar_race_followup_94%	I like Dahlia's program better.
%abramar_race_followup_95%	Dahlia strikes me as a more inspiring leader.
%abramar_race_followup_96%	I don't know, instinct.
%abramar_race_followup_100%	Jasmine isn't strong enough.
%abramar_race_followup_103%	I like Dahlia's program better.
%abramar_race_followup_106%	Dahlia strikes me as a more inspiring leader.
%abramar_race_followup_109%	I don't know, instinct.
%abramar_race_followup_111%	She may get upset about it, but she'll have to understand.
%abramar_race_followup_112%	The direction of the coven is not a matter to be taken lightly.
%abramar_race_followup_113%	If either of them don't respect my stance, they aren't suited to lead to begin with.
%abramar_race_followup_114%	Mmm... good point.
%abramar_race_followup_118%	Why did you choose to go with Jasmine?
%abramar_race_followup_121%	Dahlia feels too naive.
%abramar_race_followup_122%	I like Jasmine's program better.
%abramar_race_followup_123%	Jasmine is better suited to lead.
%abramar_race_followup_124%	I don't know, instinct.
%abramar_race_followup_128%	Why did you choose to go with Dahlia?
%abramar_race_followup_131%	Jasmine isn't strong enough.
%abramar_race_followup_132%	I like Dahlia's program better.
%abramar_race_followup_133%	Dahlia strikes me as a more inspiring leader.
%abramar_race_followup_134%	I don't know, instinct.
%abramar_race_followup_140%	Don't you feel that playing both sides it's a bit sleazy?
%abramar_race_followup_143%	I just want to support both of my friends.
%abramar_race_followup_144%	I'd rather control these elections at any cost.
%abramar_race_followup_145%	It's ok. Either of them will make a great leader.
%abramar_race_followup_146%	I couldn't bring myself to let either of them down...
%abramar_race_followup_150%	I just want to support both of my friends.
%abramar_race_followup_154%	I'd rather control these elections at any cost.
%abramar_race_followup_155%	Oh, wow, that's cold blooded.
%abramar_race_followup_156%	I thought you held your friends in the highest esteem.
%abramar_race_followup_157%	I do... but I took too much shit already to leave the future of the coven down to chance.
%abramar_race_followup_158%	I understand that this position is a bit unethical, but I don't care. My fate is more important than my virtue.
%abramar_race_followup_160%	Hahahaha, spoken like a true survivor.
%abramar_race_followup_162%	Alright, I won't torture your conscience any further.
%abramar_race_followup_163%	Do what you have to do.
%abramar_race_followup_167%	It's ok. Either of them will make a great leader.
%abramar_race_followup_171%	I couldn't bring myself to let either of them down...
%abramar_race_followup_175%	And what about your own beliefs?
%abramar_race_followup_176%	You don't care what direction the coven takes?
%abramar_race_followup_177%	I do! But I also trust them.
%abramar_race_followup_178%	If something doesn't sit right with me I'll try to change their minds.
%abramar_race_followup_179%	And if we can't get to an agreement I'll always be able to speak through my vote.
%abramar_race_followup_180%	I can't vote for both of them, after all.
%abramar_race_followup_182%	Right, right.
%abramar_race_followup_183%	You'll form a better picture for who to vote for if you gather information from both sides, anyway.
%abramar_race_followup_188%	Why have you decided not to support either of them?
%abramar_race_followup_191%	It's their own fight.
%abramar_race_followup_192%	I don't want to pick sides.
%abramar_race_followup_193%	I think I would make a better leader.
%abramar_race_followup_194%	I don't want to have anything to do with politics.
%abramar_race_followup_198%	It's their own fight.
%abramar_race_followup_199%	I can't ascribe 100% to either of their beliefs, anyway.
%abramar_race_followup_200%	So I'd rather wish them luck and vote for whoever I prefer at the end of the race.
%abramar_race_followup_201%	Very respectable.
%abramar_race_followup_205%	I don't want to pick sides.
%abramar_race_followup_207%	Neutrality is the flag of cowards.
%abramar_race_followup_208%	It's not like that.
%abramar_race_followup_209%	This matter is too delicate to risk our friendship over it.
%abramar_race_followup_210%	So I'd rather wish them luck and vote for whoever I prefer at the end of the race.
%abramar_race_followup_212%	Mmm... I see. I can respect that.
%abramar_race_followup_217%	I think I would make a better leader.
%abramar_race_followup_219%	Oh! Wow! Hahahahahaha!
%abramar_race_followup_221%	I like you so much, you always mean business.
%abramar_race_followup_222%	Are you planning on running for leader yourself, then?
%abramar_race_followup_223%	I don't know if that's possible from exile.
%abramar_race_followup_224%	But if I get the chance, you can bet your ass I will.
%abramar_race_followup_226%	Hahahahaha! Fantastic!
%abramar_race_followup_228%	I'd love to witness the kind of leader you become.
%abramar_race_followup_229%	Yeah... I'm curious, too.
%abramar_race_followup_231%	You are strong and smart, you'd make a great leader.
%abramar_race_followup_232%	Haha... thanks.
%abramar_race_followup_237%	I don't want to have anything to do with politics.
%abramar_race_followup_238%	Ah... what a pity.
%abramar_race_followup_239%	I think you'd make an excellent leader.
%abramar_race_followup_240%	What, me!?
%abramar_race_followup_241%	Even aside from what an asset your reality-altering arts would be for the coven... you are strong and smart.
%abramar_race_followup_242%	You'd be excellent.
%abramar_race_followup_243%	Hah... I'm not so sure.
%abramar_race_followup_244%	I believe in you.
%abramar_race_followup_245%	Shut up.
%abramar_race_followup_250%	By the way, I'm curious about one thing...
%abramar_race_followup_251%	Why didn't you tell any of your friends about the true nature of your divination?
%abramar_race_followup_252%	You know, the little detail about being a writer and not a reader.
%abramar_race_followup_253%	Ah... I'm scared.
%abramar_race_followup_254%	I'm scared about how they would react.
%abramar_race_followup_255%	But I am also afraid of myself.
%abramar_race_followup_256%	I'm still figuring out what this rediscovered power means, and what to do about it.
%abramar_race_followup_257%	I don't feel any different...
%abramar_race_followup_258%	But the pressure is immeasurable.
%abramar_race_followup_260%	I see...
%abramar_race_followup_261%	I am afraid too.
%abramar_race_followup_262%	But I'm here with you.
%abramar_race_followup_263%	I can help you get through this, Fortuna.
%abramar_race_followup_264%	Whoa, are you so afraid that you're desperate to get on my good side?
%abramar_race_followup_266%	Hah, you wish, Witch.
%abramar_race_followup_268%	Jokes aside, I already told you that this is the first time I've ever encountered, throughout my many existences, something that truly terrifies me.
%abramar_race_followup_270%	But I'm starting to enjoy that feeling.
%abramar_race_followup_271%	Makes me feel alive.
%abramar_race_followup_272%	I wouldn't mind partaking in that thrill.
%abramar_race_followup_274%	Why don't you write yourself some courage?
%abramar_race_followup_277%	Mmm... Ok, I'll draw myself one card.
%abramar_race_followup_278%	No way! What if I draw something horrible?
%abramar_race_followup_282%	No way! What if I draw something horrible?
%abramar_race_followup_284%	Hahahahaha.
%abramar_race_followup_286%	I was just pulling your leg.
%abramar_race_followup_289%	I wouldn't do it, either. We created something quite frightening, huh?
%abramar_race_followup_290%	Tell me about it.
%abramar_race_followup_291%	Hey, looks like you have mail.
%abramar_race_followup_296%	Mmm... Ok, I'll draw myself one card.
%abramar_race_followup_298%	Wait, wait.
%abramar_race_followup_299%	I was just pulling your leg.
%abramar_race_followup_300%	This is too risky. What if you draw a card ripe with Fire magic and you end up in a bad place?
%abramar_race_followup_303%	A seer shouldn't be scared of their deck. I'll do it.
%abramar_race_followup_304%	Ah... you're right. Better not play with fire.
%abramar_race_followup_308%	Ah... you are right. Better not play with fire.
%abramar_race_followup_309%	Phew... You just dodged a bullet.
%abramar_race_followup_313%	A seer shouldn't be scared of their deck. I'll do it.
%abramar_race_followup_314%	Aren't you afraid of the consequences?
%abramar_race_followup_315%	Of course, but if I let fear dictate my actions, I would never have summoned you to begin with.
%abramar_race_followup_316%	Ah... you may be right.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_intro_3%	What exactly are you planning to ask, anyway?
%spread_cosmic_wheel_intro_4%	It is more of a request than a question.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_intro_5%	I want to demand that the deck submit to my will.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_intro_7%	It's not likely I'll ever stop using it, so I'd better tame it.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_intro_9%	HAHAHAHAHA.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_intro_11%	You sure are something else.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_intro_12%	Let's see how this gamble of yours plays out.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_6%	The Cosmic Wheel has decided to manifest as a card, and will allow me to envision every possible past or future.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_8%	HAHAHAHAHAHA.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_10%	You summoned the fucking Cosmic Wheel out of sheer willpower?
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_11%	Hahahahahaha.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_13%	I think I'm in love!
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_14%	Shut up.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_16%	Well? How does it work?
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_17%	This card will be in my deck from now on.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_18%	If I draw it, it'll allow me to access every possible outcome of a question.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_19%	You didn't fully remove the element of chance, then.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_20%	That'd make divination pretty dull, right?
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_21%	What a lame thrillseeker you are.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_23%	Hahahahaha.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_obey_25%	You're right.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_followup_3%	Congratulations.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_followup_5%	You never cease to amaze me.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_followup_6%	Glad to see you're having fun.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_followup_7%	Speaking of fun, looks like you've got mail.
%spread_cosmic_wheel_followup_8%	Oh!
%arbiter_on_grethe_2%	Hello again, Fortuna. How are you?
%arbiter_on_grethe_3%	Hello, Théa. Get on with the bad news already.
%arbiter_on_grethe_5%	Ah, of course...
%arbiter_on_grethe_10%	Look... your friend Jasmine informed the Arbitrage Office that she discovered a fellow Witch had summoned a Behemoth.
%arbiter_on_grethe_11%	No... Jasmine, what did you do...
%arbiter_on_grethe_12%	It was her duty, don't blame her.
%arbiter_on_grethe_13%	The thing is...
%arbiter_on_grethe_22%	I got my promotion, just as you foretold. I am a Waxing Gibbous, now!
%arbiter_on_grethe_24%	The downside is that I did so by arresting your friend Grethe for breaking the Magical Pact.
%arbiter_on_grethe_26%	No... Grethe... this is my fault.
%arbiter_on_grethe_28%	Why? Did you collude in the summoning of this Behemoth?
%arbiter_on_grethe_29%	No! I'm talking about my prediction.
%arbiter_on_grethe_31%	Come on! That can't be your fault!
%arbiter_on_grethe_32%	Yeah... I'm not so sure.
%arbiter_on_grethe_36%	Your prophecy came true. I've arrested a Witch...
%arbiter_on_grethe_37%	That Witch is your friend, though...
%arbiter_on_grethe_41%	I wish it didn't have to be this way, but Grethe broke the Magical Pact.
%arbiter_on_grethe_42%	Summoning a Behemoth is not something any of us should overlook...
%arbiter_on_grethe_43%	I had to arrest her.
%arbiter_on_grethe_44%	No... Why... Grethe... This is horrible!
%arbiter_on_grethe_46%	I wish I could have done something about it...
%arbiter_on_grethe_50%	I don't know how to put this...
%arbiter_on_grethe_51%	But your prediction came true.
%arbiter_on_grethe_52%	My...
%arbiter_on_grethe_53%	Wait, which prediction!?
%arbiter_on_grethe_54%	No, please...
%arbiter_on_grethe_56%	I killed Grethe.
%arbiter_on_grethe_57%	Why!? You're abominable!
%arbiter_on_grethe_58%	It was justified. She broke the Magical Pact by summoning that Behemoth.
%arbiter_on_grethe_59%	And I gave her every chance to give up, but apparently she preferred to die than to be arrested.
%arbiter_on_grethe_60%	Grethe...
%arbiter_on_grethe_61%	I'm sorry.
%arbiter_on_grethe_62%	No... you're right, this is my fault...
%arbiter_on_grethe_63%	No, Fortuna, this is not your fault. She made her choice.
%arbiter_on_grethe_64%	Yeah... I'm not so sure.
%arbiter_on_grethe_67%	Come on, Fortuna... Don't torture yourself like that.
%arbiter_on_grethe_68%	You wouldn't understand...
%arbiter_on_grethe_70%	What is there to understand?
%arbiter_on_grethe_71%	Is there something we're not aware of?
%arbiter_on_grethe_72%	Stop writing shit down.
%arbiter_on_grethe_73%	Leave me alone now... please.
%arbiter_on_grethe_75%	Ok, ok, I'm sorry...
%arbiter_on_grethe_77%	Before I leave... Grethe wanted you to have something.
%arbiter_on_grethe_superarcana_2%	Take care, Fortuna.
%grethe_c4_free_3%	Hello, beautiful.
%grethe_c4_free_4%	Hi, Grethe! How are you?
%grethe_c4_free_5%	Very well, thanks to you.
%grethe_c4_free_6%	Haha, happy to hear that!
%grethe_c4_free_8%	Seriously, I thought I was done for. You saved my life.
%grethe_c4_free_9%	I am in your debt.
%grethe_c4_free_10%	No need! I'm just happy everything turned out ok in the end.
%grethe_c4_free_12%	Well, I brought you something as a thank you present regardless.
%grethe_c4_free_13%	Oh? What is it?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_3%	You craft your own cards, right?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_4%	I managed to capture my Behemoth's essence inside a Super Arcana.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_6%	Hope it's useful to you!
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_7%	This is fantastic, Grethe! Thank you so much!
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_8%	Glad to hear you like it.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_10%	I thought with the upcoming elections your hands are gonna be full attending to many Witches.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_11%	I hope this helps.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_12%	Hahaha, you're right. We're all about to get into a fine mess.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_14%	Heard our friend Dahlia is running for leader.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_15%	That's right.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_16%	Are you planning on supporting her with your cards?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_22%	Ah... no, I'm sorry. I'm gonna be helping Jasmine.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_25%	Ah... I wanted to, but in the end I switched to Jasmine's side.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_27%	What? Why?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_28%	Dahlia's program is way more forward-thinking!
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_31%	(POWER: Change her mind.)
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_32%	Dahlia is too naive. Jasmine is more sensible.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_33%	Maybe you're right...
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_38%	Don't you think Dahlia is too idealistic?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_39%	I mean, it's beautiful to believe in the goodness inside us all.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_40%	But good intentions aren't enough to lead a coven.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_41%	Dahlia has a well-known history of disregarding authority.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_42%	And that's really valuable, don't get me wrong.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_43%	But I believe she can do much better from the opposition: keeping our leaders in check, but leaving the responsibility in the hands of someone more sensible.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_45%	That is a pretty strong argument, Fortuna.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_46%	I may have been blinded by friendship.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_48%	You really are the one best suited to assess both candidates.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_49%	I'll put some thought into it... but you may be right, yeah.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_50%	I'm glad you understand.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_55%	Dahlia is too naive. Jasmine is more sensible.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_57%	I get your point...
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_58%	But haven't we had enough conservative leaders in the coven?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_60%	Having Dahlia at the helm will surely stir up some chaos.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_61%	But I believe this coven may be too old... It's a bit stale.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_62%	Some progressive moves will make us evolve in more interesting directions, rather than maintaining our status at the price of stagnation.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_63%	That's good thinking.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_64%	Don't get me wrong, if Dahlia becomes the next leader I'll be happy too.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_66%	But right now I'd rather support Jasmine.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_68%	Of course, of course. I respect your position.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_70%	It just surprised me a bit, that's all.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_74%	Maybe you're right...
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_75%	But I feel safer in Jasmine's hands.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_76%	In the end, I'll be happy whoever wins. They are both well intentioned, and that's what ultimately matters.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_80%	Absolutely!
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_81%	My new deck is definitely going to be an asset during these elections.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_83%	I couldn't think of a better counselor, hahaha.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_84%	I'm looking forward to seeing you and Dahlia win this race.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_86%	This coven is due for some major change.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_87%	We've had enough conservative leaders.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_88%	I'll do my best!
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_92%	Ah... I'll be supporting both of them, actually.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_93%	Oh, really?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_95%	Isn't that a bit counterproductive?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_96%	I mean, if you paddle in two directions you're just not going anywhere.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_97%	I don't see it like that.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_98%	I'm not paddling towards anything, I just want to help my friends have the best race possible.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_99%	Whoever wins is fine by me. Both of them are well intentioned and would make a great leader.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_100%	I'm just backup, watching out for risks and opportunities.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_102%	That's admirable.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_104%	But you can only vote for one, anyway. Who is it gonna be?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_105%	I haven't decided yet. Let's see how the race unfolds.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_106%	Fair enough.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_110%	I'm not helping Dahlia... or Jasmine, for what it's worth.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_111%	Oh? Why?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_114%	Ah... I don't know. I'd rather not pick sides. It's their fight, at the end of the day.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_115%	It would get too messy if I started playing favorites.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_117%	Oh, I see how that could be a pickle, yeah.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_119%	Totally understandable, no worries.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_123%	What do you think about the whole mess of eating or freeing Aedana's corpse?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_126%	Absorbing her power sounds tempting.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_127%	I say we scatter her and welcome more Witches.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_131%	Absorbing her power sounds tempting.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_132%	I'm curious about where I could take my divination if I became more powerful.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_133%	And it would surely help you with your quest to find the meaning of life, too.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_134%	Heh... that sure is tempting.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_135%	Dahlia won't be happy to hear you talk like that, though.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_139%	I say we scatter her and welcome more Witches.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_140%	Being more powerful sounds nice and all.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_141%	But we'll become more powerful as a coven anyway if we welcome more members.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_142%	Heh, Jasmine won't be happy to hear that.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_145%	I myself haven't decided yet.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_146%	Both options are too interesting.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_148%	I'll let the contestants do their work and present solid arguments towards their stances.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_149%	Then I'll see.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_150%	That's a wise plan.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_152%	Anyway, I should be going now.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_153%	I feel the urge to start reading some political treaties, hehe.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_154%	Do you think studying politics will get me closer to understanding the meaning of life?
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_155%	Ah... I don't know.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_156%	Who does, haha.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_157%	Well, I'll be leaving now.
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_159%	See you soon!
%grethe_c4_free_superarcana_160%	Bye bye!
%grethe_romance_6%	Hello, beautiful.
%grethe_romance_7%	Hi, Grethe! How are you?
%grethe_romance_9%	Better than ever, thanks to you.
%grethe_romance_11%	And I'm not just talking about the Behemoth.
%grethe_romance_12%	Eh?
%grethe_romance_14%	Listen, I wanted to thank you for helping me.
%grethe_romance_15%	Here.
%grethe_romance_21%	Fortuna...
%grethe_romance_22%	Hey, Grethe... are you alright?
%grethe_romance_23%	No. I need your help.
%grethe_romance_24%	What happened?
%grethe_romance_25%	The Arbitrage Office is after me...
%grethe_romance_26%	I don't have anywhere to go.
%grethe_romance_27%	Please, will you let me hide in your basement until the coast is clear?
%grethe_romance_29%	It's pretty obvious I summoned a Behemoth... I can't roam the cosmos freely anymore...
%grethe_romance_32%	Apparently your friend Jasmine ratted me out to the Arbiters...
%grethe_romance_33%	No... Jasmine, why...
%grethe_romance_34%	She heard it from me, I'm so sorry, Grethe.
%grethe_romance_35%	I don't blame you, you were just trying to help.
%grethe_romance_36%	I won't ever forgive Jasmine, though.
%grethe_romance_37%	I can't believe she sold you out...
%grethe_romance_38%	I'm sure she was trying to do what's right... but still.
%grethe_romance_40%	Can I stay here...?
%grethe_romance_41%	Yes! Yes, by all means.
%grethe_romance_42%	You can stay with me as long as you want.
%grethe_romance_43%	I'm so sorry...
%grethe_romance_44%	Don't be! I'm happy to have some company, being exiled and all...
%grethe_romance_45%	Ah...
%grethe_romance_47%	Thank you so much.
%grethe_romance_49%	I brought a thank you present.
%grethe_romance_50%	Not just for hiding me, but for having helped me with the Behemoth and everything.
%grethe_romance_superarcana_2%	I captured my Behemoth's essence inside a Super Arcana.
%grethe_romance_superarcana_4%	I thought it could make a great addition to your deck.
%grethe_romance_superarcana_5%	Grethe!!! I love it!!!
%grethe_romance_superarcana_6%	Thank you so much!
%grethe_romance_superarcana_7%	Hahaha, glad to hear you like it.
%grethe_romance_superarcana_8%	I'm gonna make a beautiful card with it. Thank you so much.
%grethe_romance_superarcana_10%	Oh my god, you're so cute.
%grethe_romance_superarcana_11%	Haha, shut up.
%grethe_romance_superarcana_13%	There is something else I need to tell you.
%grethe_water_seal_3%	I'm in love with you.
%grethe_water_seal_4%	Grethe!
%grethe_water_seal_6%	(What is this energy surge inside my chest!?)
%grethe_water_seal_7%	(I've never felt this way before.)
%grethe_water_seal_8%	(Is it the water seal!? I...)
%grethe_water_seal_9%	(I...)
%grethe_water_seal_10%	I love you too!
%grethe_water_seal_11%	I love you, Grethe!
%grethe_water_seal_12%	Ah! I'm so happy!
%grethe_water_seal_13%	Feels so weird and so good to say it out loud...
%grethe_water_seal_14%	I love you! I love you!
%grethe_water_seal_15%	I don't know how this is possible, but I love you more than I ever thought I could love anyone.
%grethe_water_seal_17%	Did you cast a spell on me?
%grethe_water_seal_18%	Hahaha, I'd say this is fate.
%grethe_water_seal_19%	What do we do now?
%grethe_water_seal_20%	I don't know! Do you want to make out?
%grethe_water_seal_21%	Grethe!
%grethe_water_seal_23%	What!? We discovered something wonderful, may as well enjoy the ride!
%grethe_water_seal_24%	Hahaha, yes. Yes, hug me, kiss me. Come here!
%grethe_make_love_2%	I don't know about unraveling the meaning of life but that was fucking close.
%grethe_make_love_3%	I love you.
%grethe_make_love_4%	I love you too.
%grethe_make_love_5%	You know... this was my first time with another Witch.
%grethe_make_love_6%	And it is something... surreal.
%grethe_make_love_7%	Me too. I hope we can repeat it often.
%grethe_make_love_8%	Yes, please.
%grethe_make_love_10%	Speaking of...
%grethe_make_love_11%	I want to propose something to you.
%grethe_make_love_12%	Hmm?
%grethe_make_love_13%	What do you say I pack my stuff and come live here with you?
%grethe_make_love_14%	Oh!
%grethe_make_love_15%	That's only if you feel comfortable with it, of course, I don't want to impose.
%grethe_make_love_16%	My main occupation is to study and meditate. I would rather do it here and keep you company.
%grethe_make_love_17%	You've endured enough isolation.
%grethe_make_love_18%	That is...
%grethe_make_love_19%	That would be great, Grethe.
%grethe_make_love_20%	By all means, come live with me, please.
%grethe_make_love_21%	That's settled then.
%grethe_make_love_22%	You won't be alone from now on.
%grethe_make_love_23%	Thank you... thank you so much.
%grethe_make_love_28%	I know it's an imposition, but I'm so happy I get to hide at your place...
%grethe_make_love_29%	I'll make a great roommate, I promise.
%grethe_make_love_30%	Hahaha, what are you saying? I'm happy to have you.
%grethe_make_love_31%	My main occupation is to study and meditate, I don't make much noise.
%grethe_make_love_32%	I'm not a great cook, though.
%grethe_make_love_33%	I usually use nourishing spells to save time so that I can carry on with my investigation.
%grethe_make_love_34%	Ah, I got bored of cooking after so long in isolation.
%grethe_make_love_35%	But I can bake a mean pizza if you feel like it.
%grethe_make_love_36%	Oh! Yeah! Sign me up for that, please.
%grethe_make_love_37%	It's best to cook for someone else, anyway.
%grethe_make_love_38%	Ah... I'm so happy I got to meet you.
%grethe_make_love_39%	The cosmos seems less dreadful by your side.
%grethe_make_love_40%	Aw...
%grethe_make_love_41%	Yeah, yeah, too corny. I know.
%grethe_make_love_42%	Haha, be as corny as you want.
%grethe_make_love_43%	I'm so happy to have met you, too.
%grethe_make_love_44%	Neither of us will be alone from now on.
%grethe_make_love_45%	Thank you... thank you so much.
%grethe_make_love_46%	What are you saying? I should be the one thanking you.
%grethe_make_love_47%	I love you.
%grethe_meets_abramar_2%	There's something you need to know about me.
%grethe_meets_abramar_3%	What is it?
%grethe_meets_abramar_4%	You're not alone in dealing with Behemoths...
%grethe_meets_abramar_5%	What do you mean?
%grethe_meets_abramar_7%	I summoned a Behemoth too.
%grethe_meets_abramar_8%	Shut up.
%grethe_meets_abramar_9%	You put your life in my hands, so I guess it's only fair I do the same.
%grethe_meets_abramar_10%	Ábramar, show yourself.
%grethe_meets_abramar_12%	Holy cosmos.
%grethe_meets_abramar_13%	How is this possible?
%grethe_meets_abramar_14%	No one knows about this. Not even my closest friends.
%grethe_meets_abramar_16%	Why do you have a Behemoth?
%grethe_meets_abramar_17%	I don't have him. We're partners.
%grethe_meets_abramar_18%	We're only talking today because I summoned him.
%grethe_meets_abramar_19%	I couldn't endure my exile anymore.
%grethe_meets_abramar_20%	So I called upon him, and we're working together to regain my freedom.
%grethe_meets_abramar_21%	Ábramar is the one who taught me how to channel arcana to build my own deck.
%grethe_meets_abramar_22%	I owe him my life.
%grethe_meets_abramar_23%	That is... for lack of a better word...
%grethe_meets_abramar_25%	So cool.
%grethe_meets_abramar_26%	Fuck. It feels so good to say it out loud to another person.
%grethe_meets_abramar_27%	Thank you for understanding.
%grethe_meets_abramar_28%	Are you kidding? I'm like, the ideal audience for that kind of revelation, hahaha.
%grethe_meets_abramar_30%	Jokes aside, thank you for trusting me.
%grethe_meets_abramar_31%	I feel really fortunate.
%grethe_meets_abramar_32%	And this goes without saying, but you can rely on me.
%grethe_meets_abramar_33%	We are lovers in the forbidden now.
%grethe_meets_abramar_34%	Hahaha, the best kind of lovers there are.
%grethe_meets_abramar_35%	Ábramar, you can leave us now.
%grethe_meets_abramar_36%	Understood.
%grethe_meets_abramar_39%	You pack a mean deck and a mean ally.
%grethe_meets_abramar_40%	The cosmos better prepare itself for what my lovely Fortuna has in store.
%grethe_meets_abramar_41%	Hahaha.
%grethe_meets_abramar_42%	I just hope this all works out well for me. For us.
%grethe_meets_abramar_43%	I believe in you.
%grethe_meets_abramar_44%	Thank you.
%junreisha_2%	Welcome. Thank you for coming.
%junreisha_3%	Thank you for having me.
%junreisha_4%	I'm not used to dealing with young Witches. So, first of all, excuse me if I say something too blunt or out of place.
%junreisha_5%	Haha, don't worry, that introduction was polite enough.
%junreisha_6%	Good.
%junreisha_7%	You need to vote for Jasmine.
%junreisha_8%	I don't care for her program, really. It is just imperative that we eat Aedana's corpse.
%junreisha_9%	Whoa, I thought you came by to do some convincing, not just to order me around.
%junreisha_10%	We are inches away from unlocking a new whole dimension of understanding.
%junreisha_11%	There will always be time to open the gates to more Witches.
%junreisha_12%	Who knows? It is possible that if we ascend higher, we can directly grant illumination to anyone.
%junreisha_13%	That'd be very convenient, huh...
%junreisha_14%	I can expose some pretty solid arguments, if I may.
%junreisha_15%	Be my guest.
%junreisha_16%	Do you mind if I summon a Fatemancer's disk to calculate the chances that our interests will align?
%junreisha_19%	Sure, go ahead.
%junreisha_20%	I'd rather do this without the disk.
%junreisha_21%	(KNOWLEDGE) I know your disk's secret.
%junreisha_25%	Sure, go ahead.
%junreisha_28%	Good.
%junreisha_32%	I'd rather do this without the disk.
%junreisha_33%	Mmm... A pity.
%junreisha_34%	Understood. We'll do this the old fashioned way.
%junreisha_38%	I know your disk's secret.
%junreisha_39%	Mmm? And what that may be?
%junreisha_40%	Your invention is pretty convenient for any Witch facing some kind of critical situation.
%junreisha_41%	What they don't know is that the disk is also recording everything, collecting information for you.
%junreisha_42%	That is true, indeed. How did you learn about it?
%junreisha_43%	My third eye isn't just for looking.
%junreisha_44%	I believe you to be the first person to know.
%junreisha_45%	Please, don't disclose it to the rest of the coven, or you will deprive them of an essential tool.
%junreisha_48%	How about you make the disk stop stealing info.
%junreisha_49%	Ok, I won't.
%junreisha_53%	How about you make the disk stop stealing info.
%junreisha_54%	That I won't do.
%junreisha_55%	To collect intel on Witches' dire situations is in fact its main purpose.
%junreisha_56%	Don't you have any sense of ethics?
%junreisha_60%	Ok, I won't.
%junreisha_61%	But don't you think this is, to say the least, unethical?
%junreisha_63%	Ethics lose all meaning when you spend a decade trapped inside the dungeons of the inquisition.
%junreisha_64%	I need to gather as much information as possible for the betterment of my holistic formula.
%junreisha_65%	I won't disclose any secrets, if that is what you are worried about.
%junreisha_66%	Still, the mere knowledge of your peers' issues is a clear violation.
%junreisha_67%	That's irrelevant.
%junreisha_68%	Those are the ethics of the privileged. When you are faced with death, when you become a survivor, it's all about the results.
%junreisha_69%	How about you summon a Minister of Secrets at least, so you can't possibly disclose any sensitive information?
%junreisha_70%	I don't see it as necessary, but I will, if that keeps you from sabotaging my project.
%junreisha_71%	It'll make me feel better, yeah.
%junreisha_72%	Understood.
%junreisha_73%	Do you mind if I summon a Fatemancer's disk, anyway?
%junreisha_76%	Sure, go on.
%junreisha_77%	I'd rather do this without the disk.
%junreisha_81%	The first thing I want to use to demonstrate the advantages of harnessing power is a present.
%junreisha_82%	I learned that you craft your own cards using arcana.
%junreisha_83%	With enough power, you could create your own, and not be limited to the ones found in a grimoire.
%junreisha_84%	Here.
%junreisha_2_2%	While I was at the mercy of the Inquisition, I met a penitent pilgrim.
%junreisha_2_3%	He didn't say anything, but he left a lasting impression on me.
%junreisha_2_4%	Using my holistic formula, I captured his essence in the form of a Super Arcana, for you to use in your divination.
%junreisha_2_5%	Think about the possibilities if you were able to etch any element of the cosmos that marked you into a card.
%junreisha_2_8%	Mmm... that would come in handy.
%junreisha_2_9%	Is that enough of a reason to keep more Witches from ascending?
%junreisha_2_14%	Mmm... that would come in handy.
%junreisha_2_15%	Thank you.
%junreisha_2_19%	Is that enough of a reason to keep more Witches from ascending?
%junreisha_2_20%	It feels too egotistical.
%junreisha_2_23%	I'm aware that for someone as intelligent as you, flattery won't be enough to make up your mind.
%junreisha_2_24%	So next, allow me to make a demonstration of power.
%junreisha_2_25%	Oh, thrilling. What do you have in mind?
%junreisha_2_26%	Thanks to my understanding of the holistic formula I made myself immune to fate.
%junreisha_2_27%	Hah. Hahaha.
%junreisha_2_28%	Ahem... Sorry I laughed. It sounds way too ludicrous.
%junreisha_2_29%	Then go ahead. Read my fortune.
%junreisha_2_30%	Throw me your meanest card.
%junreisha_2_31%	It'll be my pleasure.
%junreisha_2_32%	But wait. My formula may damage your deck in the process. Are you sure you still want to go through it?
%junreisha_2_35%	Do your worst. I'm not scared.
%junreisha_2_36%	Ah... I'll take your word for it. My deck is too precious.
%junreisha_2_37%	(KNOWLEDGE) You're planning to dispel my card, aren't you?
%junreisha_2_41%	Do your worst. I'm not scared.
%junreisha_2_43%	Very well. Draw a card.
%junreisha_2_48%	Ah... I'll take your word for it. My deck is too precious.
%junreisha_2_50%	That's a pity.
%junreisha_2_51%	It would have been a pretty enlightening experience for you.
%junreisha_2_52%	Maybe, but I spent way too much time on these cards to let you break them in any way.
%junreisha_2_53%	If you don't embrace entropy you will accumulate too much baggage to be able prosper as a Witch.
%junreisha_2_54%	Attachment limits growth.
%junreisha_2_55%	I have my own ways.
%junreisha_2_56%	I'm sure you do.
%junreisha_2_57%	Well, what's your next solid argument to persuade me towards eating the old hag?
%junreisha_2_58%	I feel that's enough for today.
%junreisha_2_59%	Your mind is too burdened for me to effectively impart wisdom.
%junreisha_2_60%	That's a shame.
%junreisha_2_64%	The disk isn't looking great either.
%junreisha_2_65%	But it didn't reach zero.
%junreisha_2_66%	Only time will tell whether or not we become allies.
%junreisha_2_67%	Very well.
%junreisha_2_69%	I'll come and see you again in the future.
%junreisha_2_70%	You're welcome to come any time.
%junreisha_2_71%	Farewell.
%junreisha_2_77%	You are planning to dispel my card, aren't you?
%junreisha_2_78%	How did you...
%junreisha_2_80%	Is there a way to get ahold of one of those magnificent third eyes of yours?
%junreisha_2_81%	Would you like me to help you find one through my divination?
%junreisha_2_82%	Ah... that sounds tempting, but as I told you, I am immune to the arts of fate.
%junreisha_2_83%	Not much of a perk right now, huh?
%junreisha_2_84%	Hah...
%junreisha_2_85%	It's alright, I have my own ways.
%junreisha_2_86%	Even at the cost of a card... Do you still want me to demonstrate? I believe it'll be a very valuable lesson.
%junreisha_2_89%	Do your worst. I'm not scared.
%junreisha_2_90%	Ah... I'll take your word for it. My deck is too precious.
%spread_junreisha_intro_2%	I still need you to ask a question of sorts to effectively draw a card.
%spread_junreisha_intro_3%	And who knows, maybe you'll be surprised.
%spread_junreisha_intro_4%	I won't.
%spread_junreisha_intro_5%	But I'll play along.
%spread_junreisha_intro_6%	Is there a way for you to effectively access my fate?
%spread_junreisha_intro_7%	So you're basically challenging me, huh...
%spread_junreisha_intro_9%	I'm offering us both growth.
%spread_junreisha_intro_10%	Here we go.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_2%	You are going to destroy this card!
%spread_junreisha_challenge_4%	I'm afraid so.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_5%	But you're not *immune* to fate! You're dispelling it!
%spread_junreisha_challenge_6%	Isn't that the same?
%spread_junreisha_challenge_7%	I...
%spread_junreisha_challenge_12%	Shit. So there's no way around it.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_13%	I'm afraid not.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_14%	Could you just... not destroy it? Lesson learned.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_15%	That would be paradoxical.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_16%	But if you dispel it, you are effectively following fate.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_17%	Hah. That is true.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_18%	We can call it a draw if you like.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_19%	But I am going to dispel that card.
%spread_junreisha_challenge_20%	I...
%spread_junreisha_followup_2%	Know you haven't just dispelled a card. You obliterated a lot of time I invested in its art...
%spread_junreisha_followup_4%	Don't worry. The arcana and the energy you spent on it went back to your grimoire.
%spread_junreisha_followup_5%	Now they can become something new. That's the beauty of entropy.
%spread_junreisha_followup_8%	I can see the beauty of it, yes.
%spread_junreisha_followup_9%	But it'll never be the same!
%spread_junreisha_followup_10%	(POWER: Summon your card back.)
%spread_junreisha_followup_14%	I can see the beauty of it, yes.
%spread_junreisha_followup_17%	That pleases me. Most young Witches have too much animosity towards entropy.
%spread_junreisha_followup_18%	It is only after embracing entropy that we can fully access growth and regeneration.
%spread_junreisha_followup_19%	It can still be a pain in the ass, though.
%spread_junreisha_followup_20%	That duality is what makes it the most beautiful thing.
%spread_junreisha_followup_24%	But it'll never be the same!
%spread_junreisha_followup_26%	If you don't embrace entropy you will accumulate too much baggage to be able prosper as a Witch.
%spread_junreisha_followup_27%	Attachment limits growth.
%spread_junreisha_followup_30%	It is painful... But I get your point.
%spread_junreisha_followup_31%	We can still get new things without losing the old ones.
%spread_junreisha_followup_35%	It is painful... But I get your point.
%spread_junreisha_followup_39%	We can still get new things without losing the old ones.
%spread_junreisha_followup_41%	Ah... as to be expected from a young Witch. You are still not ready to value entropy.
%spread_junreisha_followup_42%	But you are a smart one. I won't lose hope that in time you'll learn to understand its virtues.
%spread_junreisha_followup_48%	...
%spread_junreisha_followup_49%	What? I liked that card.
%spread_junreisha_followup_50%	That somehow defeats the purpose of this lesson.
%spread_junreisha_followup_51%	But I guess that's just another way of displaying power.
%spread_junreisha_followup_53%	You have my utmost respect.
%spread_junreisha_followup_54%	What was the lesson supposed to be about?
%spread_junreisha_followup_55%	I told you. Entropy.
%spread_junreisha_followup_56%	The more things you hold dear, the less room there is for growth.
%spread_junreisha_followup_59%	Well, I get your point, even if I evaded it this time.
%spread_junreisha_followup_60%	We can still get new things without losing the old ones.
%spread_junreisha_followup_64%	Well, I get your point, even if I evaded it this time.
%spread_junreisha_followup_69%	I have one more gift.
%spread_junreisha_followup_70%	I'd love for you to explore the blessing of entropy.
%spread_junreisha_followup_72%	This is a special dark matter serum distilled using the holistic formula.
%spread_junreisha_followup_73%	Add it to your cauldron and it will allow you to dispel cards.
%spread_junreisha_followup_74%	That way, you will be able to recover the arcana and energy you used, and create greater room for experimentation and thus growth.
%spread_junreisha_followup_75%	Oh, that is interesting.
%spread_junreisha_followup_76%	I'll treasure it.
%spread_junreisha_followup_77%	Don't. Just use it.
%spread_junreisha_followup_78%	I know, I know... entropy. It was a figure of speech.
%spread_junreisha_followup_79%	Words aren't excluded from the power of entropy.
%spread_junreisha_followup_80%	Keep that in mind.
%spread_junreisha_followup_81%	Understood. Thank you.
%spread_junreisha_followup_82%	So? Are you more prone to devour Aedana and embrace her gifts?
%spread_junreisha_followup_85%	Yes. You made an excellent point.
%spread_junreisha_followup_86%	It still doesn't outweigh welcoming new sisters.
%spread_junreisha_followup_87%	I need more time to think about it.
%spread_junreisha_followup_92%	Yes. You made an excellent point.
%spread_junreisha_followup_94%	Good.
%spread_junreisha_followup_95%	Jasmine will be happy to hear that.
%spread_junreisha_followup_100%	It still doesn't outweigh welcoming new sisters.
%spread_junreisha_followup_103%	Shame.
%spread_junreisha_followup_104%	Jasmine will be disappointed.
%spread_junreisha_followup_105%	But I'll give you time. You are still young. Experiment with entropy.
%spread_junreisha_followup_106%	Sure.
%spread_junreisha_followup_111%	I need more time to think about it.
%spread_junreisha_followup_115%	I'll be leaving now.
%spread_junreisha_followup_117%	Very well. Thank you for coming.
%spread_junreisha_followup_121%	Wait.
%spread_junreisha_followup_122%	What about the Fatemancer's disk?
%spread_junreisha_followup_123%	Did it work? Are we friends now?
%spread_junreisha_followup_124%	Hah... I don't do friends.
%spread_junreisha_followup_125%	Who knows. Only time will tell.
%spread_junreisha_followup_126%	So that's how it is, huh...
%spread_junreisha_followup_127%	Well, you let me know if you suddenly feel the urge to join forces.
%spread_junreisha_followup_128%	Heh... Likewise.
%spread_junreisha_followup_129%	Farewell, Fortuna.
%abramar_on_dispelling_2%	Quite a character, this Junreisha.
%abramar_on_dispelling_5%	She's a bit full of herself.
%abramar_on_dispelling_6%	I kind of liked her, to be honest.
%abramar_on_dispelling_10%	She's a bit full of herself.
%abramar_on_dispelling_13%	I kind of liked her, to be honest.
%abramar_on_dispelling_15%	I sympathize with her.
%abramar_on_dispelling_16%	She has that kind of look only a Behemoth can recognize.
%abramar_on_dispelling_17%	What do you mean?
%abramar_on_dispelling_18%	Those eyes... you only get them when you manage to peek behind the curtain.
%abramar_on_dispelling_19%	They evoke a calm dread, if that makes any sense.
%abramar_on_dispelling_20%	Heh... I can picture myself getting there at some point if I keep delving into the mysteries of this deck.
%abramar_on_dispelling_22%	Hahahahaha, maybe... maybe not.
%abramar_on_dispelling_24%	You are too stubborn for that.
%abramar_on_dispelling_25%	Hey, I'm not that obstinate.
%abramar_on_dispelling_27%	If anything, I see you acquiring the presence of a master.
%abramar_on_dispelling_28%	It requires a special kind of confidence to evoke that.
%abramar_on_dispelling_29%	Oh, thank you.
%abramar_on_dispelling_31%	Only idiots and erudites manage to get there. And I'm still on the fence about which one you are...
%abramar_on_dispelling_33%	Hahahahahaha.
%abramar_on_dispelling_34%	Haha, very funny.
%abramar_on_dispelling_36%	By the way, that dark matter serum is quite the asset.
%abramar_on_dispelling_37%	You think so?
%abramar_on_dispelling_38%	Of course. Your first cards bear the innocence of the student. That's very romantic and all...
%abramar_on_dispelling_39%	But as you develop your expertise you can recraft those arcana in a more knowledgeable way.
%abramar_on_dispelling_40%	I suggest you try it out.
%abramar_on_dispelling_41%	Just add a drop to your cauldron over there and you'll get to dispel a card and recover the arcana and the energy you sealed into them.
%abramar_on_dispelling_43%	Mmm...
%abramar_on_dispelling_44%	Maybe I'll give it a try.
%abramar_on_dispelling_45%	It's going to be tough to part ways with those nice pieces of art, though.
%abramar_on_dispelling_46%	Maybe.
%abramar_on_dispelling_47%	You won't be able to reduce your deck size below four cards, anyway.
%abramar_on_dispelling_48%	You've grown too powerful for that. Your divination won't be able to withstand a reading with less than four cards at this point.
%abramar_on_dispelling_49%	The omnipotent paradox.
%abramar_on_dispelling_50%	Haha, more or less, yeah.
%abramar_on_dispelling_51%	I'll leave you to it.
%nova_mind_1_2%	Fuck me. I look like shit.
%nova_mind_1_3%	I don't know why I even bothered to go shopping if I don't feel like eating.
%nova_mind_1_4%	I guess my future self will thank me when I get stoned tonight.
%nova_mind_2_2%	Today is my birthday... should have gotten myself a cake or whatever...
%nova_mind_2_3%	I'll put a candle on a hot dog or something, hahaha.
%nova_mind_3_2%	Will Dennaton release a new game soon?
%nova_mind_3_3%	It's been way too long since Hotline Miami 3...
%nova_mind_3_4%	Maybe I can start another run of Elden Ring II.
%nova_mind_4_2%	I don't know why I even get up in the morning.
%nova_mind_4_3%	Life doesn't make any fucking sense.
%nova_mind_4_4%	I don't make any fucking sense.
%nova_mind_4_5%	How does everyone else manage not to hate themselves...
%nova_mind_5_2%	I wish I was brave enough to drop out of uni.
%nova_mind_5_3%	I don't even like computer science. God, I'd rather kill myself than go to work in an office.
%nova_mind_5_4%	I'd rather not work at all...
%nova_mind_5_5%	I wish there was a way to stop existing altogether.
%nova_mind_6_8%	Aren't we supposed to be living in a simulation?
%nova_mind_6_9%	Why the fuck can't I edit my character.
%nova_mind_6_12%	It's not enough that I have to live trapped in this body... I can't even leave the dome to escape everyone.
%nova_mind_6_13%	I wish I was born before the dome era...
%nova_mind_6_15%	It's time for another superbacteria to come and sweep us all away again.
%nova_mind_6_16%	I'm sure that with my luck I'd be among the survivors...
%nova_mind_6_19%	Would my life be better if I had been born on Earth?
%nova_mind_6_20%	Without universities, without corporations, just... surviving on the old planet.
%nova_mind_6_21%	I wonder if they have videogames over there...
%nova_mind_6_24%	Wasn't the Akara system supposed to make us all happy?
%nova_mind_6_25%	That crappy AI overlord probably doesn't have enough processing power to save a miserable being like me...
%nova_mind_last_2%	I hope those idiots don't ask me to hang out today for my birthday.
%nova_mind_last_3%	I don't feel like seeing anyone.
%nova_surprise_intro_2%	Fuck. I forgot the toilet paper.
%nova_surprise_2%	SURPRISE!!!
%nova_surprise_3%	Come on guys!
%nova_surprise_5%	Haaaaaappy birthday toooo youuuu.
%nova_surprise_6%	Haaaaaappy birthday toooo youuuu.
%nova_surprise_7%	Haaaaaappy birthday deaaaaar...
%nova_surprise_10%	DEADNAME
%nova_surprise_13%	Haaaaappy birthdaaay tooooo youuuu.
%nova_surprise_15%	Woo!
%nova_surprise_cake_2%	Happy birthday! Did we surprise you? Hahaha.
%nova_surprise_cake_3%	Ah...
%nova_surprise_cake_4%	Come on! Make a wish!
%nova_surprise_cake_5%	I...
%nova_surprise_cake_6%	Mmm...
%nova_surprise_cake_7%	I wish...
%nova_surprise_cake_8%	Don't say it out loud or it won't come true!
%nova_surprise_cake_9%	Ok...
%nova_surprise_cake_10%	In that case...
%nova_2%	Welcome! I'm Fortuna, nice to meet you.
%nova_3%	What's your name?
%nova_4%	I don't know...
%nova_5%	Oh, that's fine.
%nova_6%	I guess you're still figuring things out.
%nova_7%	Ah... yes. First I need to come to terms with being in outer space and having become a...
%nova_8%	Witch?
%nova_9%	That's right, you're a Witch now, girl.
%nova_10%	How do you know I'm a woman?
%nova_11%	Only women can become Witches, so there's no doubt about it.
%nova_12%	Everyone seems to be clearer than me on everything.
%nova_13%	I haven't even had the chance to get out of the closet to myself, but everyone here keeps addressing me as a woman...
%nova_14%	Oh, I'm sorry. Would you rather have me switch back to masculine pronouns?
%nova_15%	Hell no.
%nova_16%	I'm sorry.
%nova_17%	I'm just angry it didn't all happen on my terms.
%nova_18%	Well, you have an eternity ahead of you to enjoy your true self.
%nova_19%	I guess I should be celebrating.
%nova_20%	But... I can't still picture myself out of this ugly beard and hoodie.
%nova_21%	I believe I can help you with that, if you'd like.
%nova_22%	What do you have in mind, some kind of glow up?
%nova_23%	You'll be the one doing the transition. I'll just offer some guidance.
%nova_24%	It's not very different from what all of us Witches had to go through.
%nova_25%	None of us ascended in these cool robes and hats.
%nova_26%	I'm an engineer. I wouldn't even know where to begin with designing an outfit...
%nova_27%	It'll all come to you. Trust me.
%nova_28%	Shall we perform a rite?
%nova_29%	I did it for my sister once. You can just relax, this is a pretty cool moment in a Witch's life.
%nova_30%	Ah... I'm in your hands, whatever.
%nova_31%	First of all, I'm gonna summon a Fatemancer's Disk to check on our chances of success for the ritual.
%nova_33%	Chances of success? Does this mean I can fail?
%nova_34%	Not really, it'll just mean you'll take more time to figure out your Witch identity. But it'll come to you in time.
%nova_35%	Great...
%nova_36%	Ah... Just try to enjoy it.
%nova_37%	Sure.
%nova_38%	What do I have to do?
%nova_39%	There are many ways to go about this. My favorite one is by making some tea!
%nova_41%	I'm going to interview you to try to find some elements that are fundamental to your essence.
%nova_42%	Then we'll pour them into this teapot and brew a Cathartic Infusion.
%nova_43%	Haha... this sounds so surreal.
%nova_44%	But sure, I'm game.
%nova_45%	It can be pretty delicious. A good friend of mine taught me this method and now I wouldn't go about it any other way.
%nova_46%	I'm kind of envious, since this is something a Witch can only taste before transitioning.
%nova_47%	Are you ready?
%nova_48%	Of course. Interview the shit out of me.
%nova_56%	Question:
%nova_59%	Tell me about yourself.
%nova_60%	What would you dream of doing as a Witch?
%nova_61%	What would your ideal aesthetic be?
%nova_62%	I have enough, let's pour you a cup.
%nova_68%	Tell me about yourself.
%nova_69%	Ah... what to say about myself...
%nova_70%	What do you like to do, a bit of your background... whatever you think is essential to your being.
%nova_71%	When I was about 10 years old, I saw a boar trample a friend to death during a school trip.
%nova_72%	That is... oddly specific.
%nova_73%	Ah... It's the first thing that came to mind and I find myself thinking about it too often whenever my mind's idle.
%nova_74%	Of course, let it flow.
%nova_75%	I like electronic music, videogames, spicy food, Western movies and gardening.
%nova_76%	Oh, gardening can be a great asset for a Witch.
%nova_77%	Well... I mostly grew marijuana and chili peppers.
%nova_78%	Is there pot in space?
%nova_79%	There is... everything in the universe.
%nova_80%	But recreationally speaking, there's way better stuff you can get ahold of now, being a Witch and all...
%nova_81%	Nice, I could do with some of that.
%nova_82%	Sure, I'll set you up with a friend of mine.
%nova_83%	Did you do anything creative?
%nova_84%	Not really... maybe cooking.
%nova_85%	I love cooking, but too often I find myself too depressed to cook anything at all.
%nova_86%	Well, you have all the time in the world now.
%nova_87%	Sure...
%nova_88%	So? Did you find anything useful?
%nova_91%	Let's add some electronic music.
%nova_92%	Let's add that childhood trauma of yours.
%nova_93%	Let's add... recreational gardening.
%nova_94%	Let's add spicy food.
%nova_98%	Let's add some electronic music.
%nova_100%	Why that, out of everything?
%nova_101%	Music has some mystical properties to it that allow us to connect with what we can't verbalize. It's a magic language in its own right.
%nova_102%	Cool.
%nova_103%	Let's continue.
%nova_107%	Let's add that childhood trauma of yours.
%nova_109%	Ah... Why did I even say that.
%nova_110%	I'm sure it came to mind for a reason. I say we go with your more instinctive reaction.
%nova_111%	Alright...
%nova_115%	Let's add... recreational gardening.
%nova_117%	Hah... Will I become a Witch dealer?
%nova_118%	In a sense, we're all dealers in our community.
%nova_119%	We don't have money, so we all offer our goods and services to the rest.
%nova_120%	That's cool.
%nova_124%	Let's add spicy food.
%nova_126%	Whoa.
%nova_127%	Is something the matter?
%nova_128%	Not at all. It surprised me, but as you said it out loud I felt a strong connection to it.
%nova_129%	You nailed it.
%nova_130%	Hahaha, great.
%nova_131%	Now...
%nova_136%	What would you dream of doing as a Witch?
%nova_137%	I don't know. What does a Witch typically do? Eat children and curse towns?
%nova_138%	Hahaha, no.
%nova_139%	Well... not typically.
%nova_140%	You can do whatever you want.
%nova_141%	Some of us take care of magical gardens; some others craft daggers; some others organize cosmic orgies...
%nova_142%	Myself, I dabble in divination.
%nova_143%	Mmm...
%nova_144%	I don't know. I just want to have fun. Make some true friendships. Visit different places... I felt trapped for too long in my apartment.
%nova_145%	I want to be free.
%nova_146%	You can do all that outside of your occupation.
%nova_147%	Any crafts you may be interested in?
%nova_148%	I don't know... I was preparing myself to become a computer engineer.
%nova_149%	I also enjoy growing stuff, so... making potions?
%nova_150%	Or maybe... an explorer? Any excuse to visit lots of cool places.
%nova_151%	Mmm... I see... What to add as your vocation...
%nova_154%	I picture you as a scientist Witch.
%nova_155%	I picture you as a gardener Witch.
%nova_156%	I picture you as a traveling merchant Witch.
%nova_160%	I picture you as a scientist Witch.
%nova_162%	Mmm... I wouldn't say there's a lot of a scientist in me.
%nova_163%	Why were you studying computer science, then?
%nova_164%	I don't know. You have to do something...
%nova_165%	Well, science doesn't mean you'll have to put on a lab coat and do a lot of math.
%nova_166%	Occult sciences can be really fun.
%nova_167%	Sure, I'll try it.
%nova_168%	Ok, now...
%nova_172%	I picture you as a gardener Witch.
%nova_174%	Oh... that sounds interesting.
%nova_175%	Are there gardens in space, though?
%nova_176%	Of course, the best kinds of gardens.
%nova_177%	Oh, now I'm intrigued.
%nova_178%	I'd very much like to tamper with some magical growth arts.
%nova_179%	I can put you in contact with a great mentor in that regard, hehe.
%nova_180%	Yes, please. Sign me up!
%nova_181%	Perfect.
%nova_185%	I picture you as a traveling merchant Witch.
%nova_187%	Ah... the traveling part sounds fun.
%nova_188%	But I don't know if I have the charisma to become a merchant.
%nova_189%	You do. We Witches all have charisma.
%nova_190%	I'd say one can't ascend without the necessary charisma. Comes with the package.
%nova_191%	Once you've found your true self I'm sure you'll be radiant!
%nova_192%	I hope so.
%nova_193%	Alright, I think I can picture myself roaming the cosmos with my wares.
%nova_194%	Nice.
%nova_199%	What would your ideal aesthetic be?
%nova_200%	Urgh... I don't have a single clue.
%nova_201%	Definitely not this.
%nova_202%	Mmm... use your instincts. Pour out any keywords that may come to mind.
%nova_203%	Ah... I don't know... what could be the opposite of this?
%nova_204%	I'm too embarrassed to say anything out loud, to be honest.
%nova_205%	I'm not comfortable speaking so openly about how I'd like to look.
%nova_206%	Take your time.
%nova_207%	Something flashy?
%nova_208%	Sexy...? Ah... shit, what am I saying.
%nova_209%	I feel like any look would be too big for me to fill.
%nova_210%	I want to feel good about myself, but I also don't want to overdo it.
%nova_211%	A Witch isn't capable of overdoing her looks.
%nova_212%	You met Dahlia, right?
%nova_213%	Fuck yes. But she is one hell of a woman.
%nova_214%	You're a hell of a woman, too.
%nova_215%	I don't feel so ready to own that...
%nova_216%	Mmm... Ok, How about...
%nova_219%	Something hot.
%nova_220%	Something exotic.
%nova_221%	Something empowering.
%nova_225%	Something hot.
%nova_227%	Fuck me.
%nova_228%	I'd love to look hot, but I couldn't picture that in a million years.
%nova_229%	Muster some courage, girl.
%nova_230%	I perceive a lot of hotness in you, and I'm a seer.
%nova_231%	Hah... thanks for the encouragement.
%nova_235%	Something exotic.
%nova_237%	Urgh... I'm not a fan of that word.
%nova_238%	Why not? It's really cool!
%nova_239%	I'd rather do regular cool. Not exotic cool.
%nova_240%	Ah... I see.
%nova_241%	I trust you can own the look, though.
%nova_242%	Believe in yourself.
%nova_243%	Uh... ok.
%nova_247%	Something empowering.
%nova_249%	Ah, I'd love that...
%nova_250%	Do you really think I could pull it off?
%nova_251%	I don't have any doubt.
%nova_252%	Ok... let's go with empowering then.
%nova_253%	Cool.
%nova_257%	I have enough, let's pour you a cup.
%nova_258%	The odds on that disk of yours aren't as high as I'd like them to be...
%nova_259%	They're good enough. Fill the rest with your willpower.
%nova_260%	You can do this.
%nova_261%	Ah... alright. Let's drink this.
%nova_262%	Cheers.
%nova_transition_2%	Oh my goodness, you look amazing!!
%nova_transition_3%	Do I?
%nova_transition_4%	Yes!! You are stunning!
%nova_transition_5%	Can't wait to get in front of a mirror, but I feel stunning myself, yes!
%nova_transition_7%	I feel weightless!
%nova_transition_8%	This is amazing, Fortuna. Thank you so much.
%nova_transition_9%	Thank you, thank you, thank you!!
%nova_transition_10%	Congratulations!
%nova_transition_12%	How can I ever repay you?
%nova_transition_13%	You just become the best Witch you can be.
%nova_transition_14%	Enjoy it.
%nova_transition_15%	You can count on it.
%nova_transition_16%	Can you feel it now, your calling?
%nova_transition_17%	Yes!
%nova_transition_20%	I am The Peppermancer!
%nova_transition_21%	Hahaha, that is so cool!
%nova_transition_22%	What are your powers about?
%nova_transition_24%	I don't know yet! Hahaha.
%nova_transition_25%	Hahahaha.
%nova_transition_27%	Something spicy, that's for sure.
%nova_transition_28%	I need to find a fitting name for this persona.
%nova_transition_29%	And I need to figure out what I'm gonna do from now on!
%nova_transition_30%	Ah! So many questions! I feel anxious and excited...
%nova_transition_31%	I can help you out with that.
%nova_transition_32%	My specialty is helping Witches dealing with questions using my deck.
%nova_transition_33%	Oh! Dahlia told me about that.
%nova_transition_34%	I was kind of bummed when you decided to brew some tea instead of letting me see your deck.
%nova_transition_35%	So... yes, please, I'd love to see your cards in action.
%nova_transition_36%	It'll be my pleasure.
%spread_nova_intro_2%	I propose we look into what role you'll play in the coven.
%spread_nova_intro_3%	So you can form a better picture of where to direct your training.
%spread_nova_intro_4%	Yeah, that's cool.
%spread_nova_intro_6%	Also, what do you say we look into the future to see what you'll call yourself so you can start using your name right away.
%spread_nova_intro_7%	Yes, please!
%spread_nova_intro_8%	I can't go by "Untitled Witch Project" forever.
%spread_nova_intro_10%	Nice. Anything else you want to ask while we're at it?
%spread_nova_intro_11%	I'm fine with just that.
%spread_nova_intro_12%	Let's leave some room for discovery.
%spread_nova_intro_13%	Very well.
%spread_nova_intro_14%	Now focus on these questions while I shuffle my deck.
%spread_nova_role_6%	Your talents will grow exponentially in a very short amount of time and you will even get to surpass some of the oldest Witches.
%spread_nova_role_8%	Alright!
%spread_nova_role_9%	Straight to the top!
%spread_nova_role_10%	Hmm...
%spread_nova_role_12%	What's the matter? That's good, isn't it?
%spread_nova_role_13%	Yes, of course it's good.
%spread_nova_role_14%	But I'm a bit worried about how some Witches will react towards your meteoric ascension.
%spread_nova_role_16%	Why's that?
%spread_nova_role_17%	Jealousy is a widespread disease among Witches.
%spread_nova_role_18%	Some of us will be extremely happy to see you thrive.
%spread_nova_role_19%	But I can picture a great number of Witches getting salty about it.
%spread_nova_role_21%	Whatever, haters gonna hate.
%spread_nova_role_22%	The thing is that in a community as... intimate as ours, the hate from the haters can become a considerable nuisance.
%spread_nova_role_23%	If this is something I should be worried about, can't we look at it with another card?
%spread_nova_role_24%	Mmm... absolutely.
%spread_nova_role_26%	We'll look into how the coven is going to react.
%spread_nova_role_27%	Nice! Thank you.
%spread_nova_role_32%	You will grow a special variety of spicy peppers known as "Truth Chili." They will become an essential item in the upcoming elections.
%spread_nova_role_34%	Oh! That sounds really cool!
%spread_nova_role_35%	Very cool, indeed.
%spread_nova_role_36%	It sounds like you're going to be pretty busy, given our current political climate.
%spread_nova_role_39%	That is just perfect.
%spread_nova_role_40%	Some business is just what I need to keep my mind off the astral mess I've gotten myself into.
%spread_nova_role_41%	I'm eager to learn the ropes of Witchcraft.
%spread_nova_role_42%	You better get ready for a crash course, hahaha.
%spread_nova_role_44%	Totally, hahaha.
%spread_nova_role_45%	I'm supposed to grow some peppers and I don't even have a home or a garden yet, hahahaha.
%spread_nova_role_47%	You should talk with Jasmine about that. She's a gardener too.
%spread_nova_role_48%	I'm sure she can set you up with a nice cosmic parcel.
%spread_nova_role_49%	Perfect, I'll go and meet her after this meeting.
%spread_nova_role_50%	Thank you so much.
%spread_nova_role_51%	You're welcome.
%spread_nova_role_56%	Your beginnings will be tough. Conservative Witches will put you through absurd trials just to undermine the validity of newcomers.
%spread_nova_role_58%	Why would they do that!?
%spread_nova_role_59%	Urgh... right now the hot topic in our coven is what to do with the corpse of our former leader.
%spread_nova_role_60%	And there are two fronts:
%spread_nova_role_62%	Those who want to absorb her and become more powerful; and those who'd rather scatter her throughout the cosmos so more Witches can ascend. Just like you did.
%spread_nova_role_63%	I'm afraid you are about to become a tool for political discourse until the coven settles down.
%spread_nova_role_65%	And what if I just go and beat all those challenges?
%spread_nova_role_66%	That would make a strong case in favor of accepting more newcomers.
%spread_nova_role_67%	Hahaha, wow, what a shift in confidence.
%spread_nova_role_68%	The peppermancy suits you.
%spread_nova_role_70%	Hahahaha. I don't know! I'm rarin' to go!
%spread_nova_role_72%	Say, can we look at how I'll do in such trials?
%spread_nova_role_73%	Of course, I'll draw a new card.
%spread_nova_role_79%	At some point you will break the Magical Pact and will be forced to serve as an Arbiter.
%spread_nova_role_81%	Oh!? What does that mean?
%spread_nova_role_82%	The word Arbiter is so cool, but I don't like the "forced to serve" bit.
%spread_nova_role_83%	Ah... This isn't good news, I'm sorry.
%spread_nova_role_84%	To simplify it... The Arbitrage Office is like the Witch police.
%spread_nova_role_85%	The thing is that most of its body is comprised of Witches who committed crimes...
%spread_nova_role_87%	Ah... that's easy, then. I'll keep all my activities legal.
%spread_nova_role_88%	I'm afraid it doesn't work like that...
%spread_nova_role_89%	My predictions never fail to come true...
%spread_nova_role_90%	So, at some point, for whatever reason, you will be forced to break the Magical Pact. Maybe you'll even do so by accident...
%spread_nova_role_91%	But sooner or later you will end up having to serve as an Arbiter.
%spread_nova_role_93%	Just my luck...
%spread_nova_role_95%	Does an Arbiter have a good life, at least?
%spread_nova_role_96%	Interesting investigations and cool police action?
%spread_nova_role_97%	I don't really know.
%spread_nova_role_98%	I'm sorry.
%spread_nova_role_99%	Whatever... better not get attached to the peppermancy thing, then...
%spread_nova_role_104%	You are going to grow magical peppers and they are going to be in high demand. Especially the Lust Reapers, which will multiply sexual arousal and stimulus.
%spread_nova_role_106%	Hell yeah!
%spread_nova_role_108%	That sounds like totally my shit, hahaha.
%spread_nova_role_109%	Hahaha, I know a great deal of Witches who'll want to bid on your harvest.
%spread_nova_name_28%	You are $N, the Peppermancer.
%spread_nova_name_30%	Whoa... $N2...
%spread_nova_name_31%	Sounds so alien to me...
%spread_nova_name_33%	It feels like stealing a name from the identity database or something, hahaha.
%spread_nova_name_35%	But I like it a lot!
%spread_nova_name_36%	I'll do my best to live up to this name!
%spread_nova_name_38%	Thank you so much, Fortuna.
%spread_nova_name_40%	You are welcome, $N3.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_6%	Your unparalleled potential will earn you the utmost respect from the coven.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_8%	YES!
%spread_nova_covensreaction_10%	Dear coven, get ready for some high level peppermancy!
%spread_nova_covensreaction_11%	Hahaha, happy to see you all fired up.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_12%	This is great news for you and for the coven.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_13%	I won't let you down.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_14%	Thank you so much.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_19%	Your rapid ascension will harvest much resentment from the weak and the sour.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_21%	Ah, shit... Why does there always have to be people like that?
%spread_nova_covensreaction_22%	I guess not even Witches can escape the curse of emotion.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_24%	Bah, I'll just stick to what I've always done.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_25%	Surround myself with people who love me and fuck the rest.
%spread_nova_covensreaction_26%	Sounds like a plan.
%spread_nova_success_6%	You will emerge victorious from even the most unfair trials. You'll earn the respect of the totality of the coven.
%spread_nova_success_8%	Fuck yes!
%spread_nova_success_10%	Everyone get ready, for a super witch is born! hahahaha!
%spread_nova_success_11%	Hahahaha. Love your energy.
%spread_nova_success_13%	This new life keeps getting better and better.
%spread_nova_success_15%	Thank you so much, Fortuna.
%spread_nova_success_16%	My pleasure.
%spread_nova_success_21%	You will be ground down, and the conservative Witches will use your failures to make their case against accepting more newcomers.
%spread_nova_success_23%	Fuck me, and fuck those hags.
%spread_nova_success_24%	Shit, why does there always have to be sickening people like them, even in outer fucking space.
%spread_nova_success_26%	I just want to be left alone.
%spread_nova_success_27%	It sucks.
%spread_nova_success_28%	But I'm sure there will also be many cool Witches that will be happy to become friends with you.
%spread_nova_success_29%	Myself, to begin with.
%spread_nova_success_30%	Bah, I'll just stick to what I've always done.
%spread_nova_success_31%	Surround myself with people who love me and fuck the rest.
%spread_nova_success_32%	Sounds like a plan.
%spread_nova_followup_2%	That's a wrap.
%spread_nova_followup_4%	How did you like my divination?
%spread_nova_followup_5%	Super cool. You've got a great talent.
%spread_nova_followup_6%	Although I'm not sure if I'll resort to it again any time soon...
%spread_nova_followup_7%	There's something dreadful in becoming aware of fate's existence and knowing you can't escape it.
%spread_nova_followup_8%	Not that you're to blame, don't get me wrong.
%spread_nova_followup_9%	Hahaha, yeah, it can cause that effect.
%spread_nova_followup_10%	I'm sure I'd lose it if I had a talent like yours.
%spread_nova_followup_11%	So tempting and so scary at the same time...
%spread_nova_followup_12%	I'll stick to the Peppermancy.
%spread_nova_followup_13%	Hah, it can be maddening at times, yes.
%spread_nova_followup_14%	What are you planning to do now?
%spread_nova_followup_15%	Mmm... Dahlia wanted to introduce me to more people.
%spread_nova_followup_16%	And now I feel ready for it, thanks to you.
%spread_nova_followup_17%	Happy to hear that.
%spread_nova_followup_18%	Please come and visit me anytime.
%spread_nova_followup_19%	I will!
%spread_nova_followup_20%	Goodbye!
%abramar_draw_power_2%	Hmm? Are you drawing multiple cards now?
%abramar_draw_power_3%	...I guess so?
%abramar_draw_power_4%	I wouldn't dare do that normally, but Aedana's trinket is making me push my boundaries.
%abramar_draw_power_5%	I drew a second card instinctively.
%abramar_draw_power_6%	Daring to do what you aren't supposed to is a reliable form of power, yes.
%abramar_draw_power_7%	Go ahead and draw the whole deck.
%abramar_draw_power_8%	I'm afraid this is as far as the Water Seal will allow me to go without tainting my divination.
%abramar_draw_power_9%	It's going to prove pretty versatile in any case, this new power.
%abramar_draw_power_10%	Hah, indeed.
%abramar_draw_power_11%	Shall I continue with the reading?
%abramar_draw_power_12%	Please.
%patrice_grandchildren_2%	Things weren't as easy as you have them right now.
%patrice_grandchildren_3%	When I was about the age of little Michael here, I was already working.
%patrice_grandchildren_4%	What did you do, grandma?
%patrice_grandchildren_5%	I spent most of my childhood helping my mom sew work clothes for the farmers.
%patrice_grandchildren_6%	I wish I had a job already... I hate school and my allowance is miserable.
%patrice_grandchildren_7%	Hahaha, you make more from your allowance than I made sewing clothes.
%patrice_grandchildren_8%	I got paid 30 cents a piece.
%patrice_grandchildren_9%	What!? Then why did you even bother doing it?
%patrice_grandchildren_10%	I had to help my mom. She was paid two dollars a piece.
%patrice_grandchildren_11%	But during those times it was enough for us to get by.
%patrice_grandchildren_12%	Why is everything more expensive now, grandma?
%patrice_grandchildren_13%	I don't think I'm ready to explain that. Ask your dad about inflation when you get home, hahaha.
%patrice_grandchildren_14%	Did your dad explain it to you?
%patrice_grandchildren_15%	Heh... I'm afraid not.
%patrice_grandchildren_16%	My dad died in the war, back in Spain. He didn't have time to teach me much, besides how to use a knife and how to cook a mean paella.
%patrice_grandchildren_17%	I love grandma's yellow rice!
%patrice_grandchildren_18%	Hahaha, you sure do, beautiful.
%patrice_grandchildren_19%	I'll make some paella tomorrow. What do you say?
%patrice_grandchildren_20%	Yesss!!
%patrice_grandchildren_21%	Yes! Yes!
%patrice_grandchildren_22%	Why did you come to America, yaya?
%patrice_grandchildren_23%	First of all, this is not America. These are the United States.
%patrice_grandchildren_24%	Ok... ok... Why did you come to the US?
%patrice_grandchildren_25%	A couple of years after my dad was killed, my mom had to flee to France with me and your auntie Fortuna to escape from the fascists. Then we moved to the US.
%patrice_grandchildren_26%	What are fascists?
%patrice_grandchildren_27%	Mmm... Very mean people who don't like anyone who thinks differently from them, or simply is different.
%patrice_grandchildren_28%	Are there any fascists in the US?
%patrice_grandchildren_29%	Too many, I'd say.
%patrice_grandchildren_30%	Oh, no... what are we going to do, grandma?
%patrice_grandchildren_31%	Hahaha... don't worry about it. I'll protect you all.
%patrice_grandchildren_32%	Yaya, tell us more stories about aunt Fortuna.
%patrice_grandchildren_33%	You know, this is the perfect place for it, since it was on this very beach I saw your aunt for the last time.
%patrice_grandchildren_34%	It was here... where she died?
%patrice_grandchildren_35%	I've told you a thousand times. Your aunt Fortuna didn't die, she went to live in the stars.
%patrice_grandchildren_36%	Come on, yaya... I'm old enough already.
%patrice_grandchildren_37%	But it is true.
%patrice_grandchildren_38%	We drove here on a beautiful summer night, just the two of us and our friend Eva.
%patrice_grandchildren_39%	I love Eva! She gives me candy.
%patrice_grandchildren_40%	Hahaha, yes, Eva's always been a sweetheart.
%patrice_grandchildren_41%	Fortuna made a delicious pizza and we opened a nice bottle of... grape juice.
%patrice_grandchildren_42%	Wine.
%patrice_grandchildren_43%	Yes, wine, María Fortuna.
%patrice_grandchildren_44%	I want wine!
%patrice_grandchildren_45%	That night there was this beautiful meteor shower.
%patrice_grandchildren_46%	So the three of us made a wish!
%patrice_grandchildren_47%	I asked for my sister to be happy.
%patrice_grandchildren_48%	She wasn't happy?
%patrice_grandchildren_49%	She... she had a good life here, but she needed more.
%patrice_grandchildren_50%	Your auntie is magical. She's always had special powers.
%patrice_grandchildren_51%	But this world wasn't ready for all she had to give.
%patrice_grandchildren_52%	Out of the blue she said...
%patrice_grandchildren_53%	"I want to be a Witch."
%patrice_grandchildren_54%	I'm scared...
%patrice_grandchildren_55%	Shh... Michael, it's alright. She's a good Witch.
%patrice_grandchildren_56%	Then she got up and started walking towards the sea.
%patrice_grandchildren_57%	The stars fell upon her from the sky, but also rose to embrace her from the bottom of the ocean.
%patrice_grandchildren_58%	She walked until she disappeared into the water.
%patrice_grandchildren_59%	She drowned, then...
%patrice_grandchildren_60%	No, she went to live in the stars, don't make me repeat myself.
%patrice_grandchildren_61%	Her body was never found. So she didn't drown.
%patrice_grandchildren_62%	She's in a magical place now. Watching over us.
%patrice_grandchildren_63%	...
%patrice_grandchildren_64%	Why doesn't she come visit us?
%patrice_grandchildren_65%	That... That I don't know, sweetheart.
%abramar_after_patrice_2%	What a bossy sister.
%abramar_after_patrice_3%	Tell me about it.
%abramar_after_patrice_4%	The Air Seal didn't seem to make a dent on her.
%abramar_after_patrice_5%	I'm a bit disappointed in my magic.
%abramar_after_patrice_8%	Hah... I believe that Patrice pities me by default, so nothing's changed really.
%abramar_after_patrice_11%	Hah. We've come a long way, there's no magic in this universe that's gonna make my sister afraid of me.
%abramar_after_patrice_14%	Heh, I'd say Patrice adores me in her own way.
%abramar_after_patrice_15%	She just has a tough way of expressing love.
%abramar_after_patrice_18%	I'm beginning to think I sided with the wrong sister, heheh...
%abramar_after_patrice_19%	Shut up.
%abramar_after_patrice_21%	So, shit is getting real. Are you excited?
%abramar_after_patrice_24%	I'm more anxious than anything.
%abramar_after_patrice_25%	As a matter of fact, I am.
%abramar_after_patrice_26%	Not really. But I don't have a choice.
%abramar_after_patrice_27%	After summoning a Behemoth, this is child's play.
%abramar_after_patrice_31%	I'm more anxious than anything.
%abramar_after_patrice_32%	A couple of days out of exile and I already wanna be left alone.
%abramar_after_patrice_34%	Hahahahahaha.
%abramar_after_patrice_36%	As soon as I finish dealing with the political kerfuffle I'm gonna take a long trip around the galaxy.
%abramar_after_patrice_39%	If I make it to leadership, my first ordinance will be to limit meetings to once a month, I swear.
%abramar_after_patrice_43%	As a matter of fact, I am.
%abramar_after_patrice_44%	I never would have guessed I'd end up tangled in politics.
%abramar_after_patrice_45%	But I'll use this opportunity to stop complaining and start doing.
%abramar_after_patrice_49%	You're about to become someone's Aedana, aren't you?
%abramar_after_patrice_50%	I want to think that I'll handle things with justice... but yeah, you never know who you're about to piss off.
%abramar_after_patrice_53%	You're about to help Dahlia become someone's Aedana, aren't you?
%abramar_after_patrice_54%	Uh... I didn't look at it that way. But knowing Dahlia I guess she's destined to piss off a lot of Witches.
%abramar_after_patrice_57%	You're about to help Jasmine become someone's Aedana, aren't you?
%abramar_after_patrice_58%	Uh... I didn't look at it that way. I just hope Jasmine's softness keeps conflict at a minimum.
%abramar_after_patrice_60%	Peace is but an illusion, eh?
%abramar_after_patrice_62%	Only peace I've ever known is when outside a universe.
%abramar_after_patrice_63%	Existence breeds chaos.
%abramar_after_patrice_67%	Not really. But I don't have a choice.
%abramar_after_patrice_68%	Come on. You always have a choice. Especially you, what with that deck of ours.
%abramar_after_patrice_69%	Hah. Patrice can be reality-altering in her own way.
%abramar_after_patrice_70%	You've witnessed it, I can't fight her.
%abramar_after_patrice_71%	I wouldn't like to have an older sibling, no sir.
%abramar_after_patrice_75%	After summoning a Behemoth, this is child's play.
%abramar_after_patrice_77%	Hahahahahaha.
%abramar_after_patrice_79%	This promises to be a fun ride, I see.
%abramar_after_patrice_84%	Ok then, what do you need me to do?
%abramar_after_patrice_85%	What do you mean?
%abramar_after_patrice_86%	For example, do you want me to deliver a letter to summon Dahlia and Jasmine to let them hear about your final stance?
%abramar_after_patrice_89%	Good idea. A friendly reunion before the race.
%abramar_after_patrice_90%	No. Game's on. Better to catch them off balance.
%abramar_after_patrice_91%	Only call Jasmine. I don't want to humiliate her in front of Dahlia.
%abramar_after_patrice_92%	Only call Dahlia. I don't want to humiliate her in front of Jasmine.
%abramar_after_patrice_97%	Good idea. A friendly reunion before the race.
%abramar_after_patrice_98%	You never know how gruesome things will get, and the three of us didn't have the chance to meet just to hang out like old times, so...
%abramar_after_patrice_99%	Do invite them, please.
%abramar_after_patrice_100%	I will.
%abramar_after_patrice_105%	No. Game's on. Better to catch them off balance.
%abramar_after_patrice_107%	Oh, damn, you're more ready for politics than I thought.
%abramar_after_patrice_108%	That's harsh, but it's the attitude of a winner, alright.
%abramar_after_patrice_109%	I respect Dahlia and Jasmine enough to know that I have to employ every resource at hand to defeat them.
%abramar_after_patrice_110%	That's all.
%abramar_after_patrice_111%	Suit yourself.
%abramar_after_patrice_116%	Only call Jasmine. I don't want to humiliate her in front of Dahlia.
%abramar_after_patrice_117%	She's as sweet as she is proud. As a courtesy, I want to let her digest that her best friends are both running against her.
%abramar_after_patrice_118%	Mmm... I'd recommend you don't pull any punches from now on.
%abramar_after_patrice_119%	Since you're up against her, don't you think that it's in our best interest to undermine her morale before the race?
%abramar_after_patrice_122%	Good call. Let's invite the two of them.
%abramar_after_patrice_123%	I won't stoop that low.
%abramar_after_patrice_129%	Good call. Let's invite the two of them.
%abramar_after_patrice_131%	That's more like it. There's a winning attitude, Fortuna.
%abramar_after_patrice_132%	You're corrupting me beyond redemption, you know that, right?
%abramar_after_patrice_134%	HAHAHAHAHAHA.
%abramar_after_patrice_136%	Oh, sure, I know you were just a sweet angel before meeting me.
%abramar_after_patrice_137%	I was half-decent, I'd say.
%abramar_after_patrice_144%	I won't stoop that low.
%abramar_after_patrice_145%	It's your call, but I warn you, don't expect as much sportsmanship from your rivals.
%abramar_after_patrice_146%	You don't know them. I'm sure they'd do the same for me.
%abramar_after_patrice_147%	Suit yourself.
%abramar_after_patrice_151%	Only call Dahlia. I don't want to humiliate her in front of Jasmine.
%abramar_after_patrice_152%	We run the risk of upsetting Dahlia and having her start a ruckus. I'd rather have a pleasant start to the race.
%abramar_after_patrice_153%	Mmm... I'd recommend you don't pull any punches from now on.
%abramar_after_patrice_154%	Since you're up against her, don't you think that it is in our best interest to shake Dahlia up a bit before the race?
%abramar_after_patrice_157%	Good call. Let's invite the two of them.
%abramar_after_patrice_158%	I won't stoop that low.
%abramar_after_patrice_170%	You know, it's a pity you wouldn't tell Patrice about my existence.
%abramar_after_patrice_171%	I believe we could have formed a pretty good team.
%abramar_after_patrice_172%	Patrice has got enough on her plate.
%abramar_after_patrice_173%	I know she'd do anything for me, but I don't want to put unnecessary burdens on her.
%abramar_after_patrice_174%	You've been doing great so far. Just keep doing what you've been doing.
%abramar_after_patrice_175%	Oh, yeah? And what's that?
%abramar_after_patrice_176%	Acting as comic relief.
%abramar_after_patrice_178%	HAHAHAHAHA.
%abramar_after_patrice_180%	We do make for a great couple of clowns, don't we?
%abramar_after_patrice_181%	Speak for yourself.
%abramar_after_patrice_183%	HAHAHAHAHA.
%abramar_after_patrice_185%	Ok, I'll do that. You just let me know if you need any more divine interventions to save your sorry ass.
%abramar_after_patrice_186%	Hahahaha.
%abramar_after_patrice_189%	I think I'm going to lay down for a bit now.
%abramar_after_patrice_190%	I need some rest before facing the mess I've gotten myself into.
%abramar_after_patrice_192%	Talk to you later.
%abramar_after_patrice_196%	Plus I should bring Grethe up to speed.
%abramar_after_patrice_197%	I guess she's in this mess by association now too.
%abramar_after_patrice_198%	Talk to you later.
%abramar_after_patrice_203%	I'm glad you let Patrice know about me.
%abramar_after_patrice_204%	You don't have to worry, she's loyal.
%abramar_after_patrice_205%	Oh, I'm not worried. On the contrary, I'm eager to team up with her.
%abramar_after_patrice_206%	Team up?
%abramar_after_patrice_207%	Come on. You have a Behemoth on your side and you were planning on not using me during the campaign?
%abramar_after_patrice_208%	Just let your sister know about my skills, I'm sure she'll put them to good use. I can spy on opponents, dig up some dirt, spin the cosmic wheel a bit in our favor, you know.
%abramar_after_patrice_209%	Uh... ok. I guess that's a great resource.
%abramar_after_patrice_210%	But don't you do anything without our approval.
%abramar_after_patrice_211%	Absolutely.
%abramar_after_patrice_212%	It may not look like it, but I'm a team player.
%abramar_after_patrice_213%	Yeah, sure.
%both_precampaign_2%	Thanks for coming.
%both_precampaign_4%	It's been centuries since we got the three of us together!
%both_precampaign_5%	I don't know why we didn't do this like, I don't know, right away!
%both_precampaign_7%	What's up, Witches.
%both_precampaign_8%	And you bet, magic life can get so chaotic sometimes that we just forget to enjoy it.
%both_precampaign_9%	Haha, yeah. It makes me so happy to see the two of you together.
%both_precampaign_12%	Tell me about some adventure I missed.
%both_precampaign_13%	What did we do last time we met?
%both_precampaign_14%	We should plan a trip for when I regain my freedom.
%both_precampaign_18%	Tell me about some adventure I missed.
%both_precampaign_19%	Mmm...
%both_precampaign_20%	I took Jasmine hunting once.
%both_precampaign_21%	What? Really!?
%both_precampaign_23%	Oh, my, she did. And never again, I tell you.
%both_precampaign_25%	Hahahaha.
%both_precampaign_27%	Jasmine really would make a fine Daemon hunter.
%both_precampaign_29%	That Sand-dweller didn't stand a chance.
%both_precampaign_30%	Jasmine planted some magical seeds into the dunes and in a matter of minutes...
%both_precampaign_32%	BOOM.
%both_precampaign_33%	A big fucking vine emerged out of the white sands, strangling the Daemon.
%both_precampaign_35%	It was horrible.
%both_precampaign_37%	I only had to slice that fucker's throat.
%both_precampaign_39%	The stench of blood, ugh... I don't know how you do it, Dahlia.
%both_precampaign_41%	Then she spent the whole evening building a grave for the wurm, hahahaha.
%both_precampaign_43%	It was beautiful, though, wasn't it? Hahaha.
%both_precampaign_44%	Hahaha, I would have loved to have been there.
%both_precampaign_47%	I missed you so much.
%both_precampaign_48%	Me too.
%both_precampaign_50%	My first order of business will be to ban fucking exile so we can all go on adventures again.
%both_precampaign_52%	Haha...
%both_precampaign_56%	What did we do last time we met?
%both_precampaign_57%	Mmm...
%both_precampaign_58%	I remember, you two came over to my garden.
%both_precampaign_60%	We had some delicious pastries that Fortuna baked herself.
%both_precampaign_62%	Oh! I remember!
%both_precampaign_63%	And we opened that bottle of Swordfish Liquor I got from the Nomad Sky Caravan!
%both_precampaign_64%	Oh, shit, I do remember now...
%both_precampaign_66%	We started to play that silly mortal game you taught us, hahaha.
%both_precampaign_68%	Oh, right! Truth or dare! Hahaha.
%both_precampaign_69%	Hahaha, it was all the rage among teenagers when I was a young mortal.
%both_precampaign_72%	Oh, damn, then I dared you to read into the future of the coven.
%both_precampaign_74%	Ah... That is how the... incident started.
%both_precampaign_76%	Fucking Aedana, this is all her fault.
%both_precampaign_77%	If you ask me, she got off lightly.
%both_precampaign_78%	Now it's up to us to clean up her fucking mess.
%both_precampaign_82%	We should plan a trip for when I regain my freedom.
%both_precampaign_84%	That's an incredible idea!
%both_precampaign_86%	Hahahaha, you got her fired up already.
%both_precampaign_88%	Any idea where would you like to go?
%both_precampaign_90%	Dephrënya, the city of blacksmiths!
%both_precampaign_91%	Hahaha, that sounds like a great trip, but I'd rather go for something less... dark, for my first time out.
%both_precampaign_92%	I've always wanted to visit the Deerfolk Kingdom.
%both_precampaign_93%	My mentor, Yu-ënia, always told me amazing stories about it.
%both_precampaign_95%	Oh! I'm in! I've heard they have some fine studs in their brothels.
%both_precampaign_97%	Dahlia!
%both_precampaign_99%	Hahahahaha.
%both_precampaign_100%	I'm sure you could use a bit of action too, Jasmine. Hahahaha.
%both_precampaign_101%	Hahahaha.
%both_precampaign_103%	I have a satisfactory sex life, what are you implying!?
%both_precampaign_105%	Haha, I was just teasing you, silly.
%both_precampaign_107%	Really...
%both_precampaign_108%	By the way...
%both_precampaign_112%	Are you nervous about the elections?
%both_precampaign_115%	You can't imagine...
%both_precampaign_116%	I'm cool. More excited than anything.
%both_precampaign_118%	On the one hand, I'm not worried because whoever wins in the end, the coven is gonna be well looked after.
%both_precampaign_119%	On the other hand, I want what's best for the coven, and I truly believe my program is the safest bet.
%both_precampaign_120%	Just to be clear, I do think you'd make for a lovely leader.
%both_precampaign_121%	But playing it safe is the death of progress, Jasmine.
%both_precampaign_122%	But aren't we all well already?
%both_precampaign_123%	We just need to iron out Aedana's more abusive politics and put some love into the community.
%both_precampaign_124%	That's because the status quo benefits you.
%both_precampaign_125%	Think about all the novices, and all the Witches who don't fit into that orderly vision, myself included.
%both_precampaign_126%	My plan is not to start a revolution, but to level the playing field.
%both_precampaign_127%	It's not fair that power is held by the eldest.
%both_precampaign_128%	Novices need to be guided, though. Think about when we had just ascended, we weren't in any shape to be making important decisions.
%both_precampaign_129%	I don't know about that. Age has its own setbacks.
%both_precampaign_130%	What do you think, Fortuna?
%both_precampaign_131%	Well... About that...
%both_precampaign_132%	I guess it's time I make my stance clear.
%both_precampaign_135%	I am running for leader myself.
%both_precampaign_138%	WHAT!?
%both_precampaign_139%	Oh, my! But aren't you exiled?
%both_precampaign_140%	Patrice is gonna help me run the campaign.
%both_precampaign_141%	In fact, it was her who practically forced me into this... venture.
%both_precampaign_143%	Ok. And what's your deal?
%both_precampaign_144%	I'm not really sure yet, we still have to define our program.
%both_precampaign_145%	But my sister is dead set on having my divination at the helm of the new government.
%both_precampaign_147%	That'd be quite an asset, alright.
%both_precampaign_148%	Have you really thought this through?
%both_precampaign_150%	I doubt a criminal has much of a chance at leadership...
%both_precampaign_151%	Whoa, that's a bit strong.
%both_precampaign_152%	I'm not a criminal, Jasmine.
%both_precampaign_153%	Part of the plan of becoming the next leader is to eradicate unfair punishments.
%both_precampaign_154%	So you actually wanted to meet us to declare war, huh?
%both_precampaign_155%	Not war! I just thought it'd be proper to let you know first-hand.
%both_precampaign_156%	I really think that, no matter who wins, the future is bright.
%both_precampaign_157%	Yeah, that's what I like to think.
%both_precampaign_159%	But the stress of competing against you two is... a bit overwhelming.
%both_precampaign_160%	Why don't we use this opportunity to promise that, no matter what, we'll still be friends after the race is over?
%both_precampaign_161%	No promises needed. I never had a doubt about it.
%both_precampaign_162%	Likewise. We will always be friends.
%both_precampaign_163%	Thank you... I don't know what I would do if I lost you.
%both_precampaign_164%	You won't.
%both_precampaign_165%	I love you.
%both_precampaign_166%	I love you too.
%both_precampaign_167%	I love you three.
%both_precampaign_168%	Fuck off.
%both_precampaign_170%	Hahahaha.
%both_precampaign_171%	Ok, the next few weeks are about to get pretty busy.
%both_precampaign_172%	I'd better leave and start preparing my knives.
%both_precampaign_174%	Figuratively speaking, I understand.
%both_precampaign_175%	No, no. Literally. I'm a daggersmith, that's what I do.
%both_precampaign_176%	No need to stab anyone, though.
%both_precampaign_177%	...I hope.
%both_precampaign_179%	Hahahahaha.
%both_precampaign_180%	Ha... ha.
%both_precampaign_182%	Ok, you two take care.
%both_precampaign_183%	Ah... ok.
%both_precampaign_184%	See you soon.
%both_precampaign_185%	Take care, both of you.
%both_precampaign_186%	Bye!
%both_precampaign_187%	Thanks for coming!
%both_precampaign_192%	I'm with Dahlia on this.
%both_precampaign_193%	I just met with Patrice and after putting some thought into it, we've decided we'll support Dahlia during the campaign.
%both_precampaign_196%	Fuck yes!
%both_precampaign_197%	What? Patrice too?
%both_precampaign_200%	Are my views so wrong that all my friends are uniting against me?
%both_precampaign_203%	Not wrong but... Dahlia's program suits our needs better.
%both_precampaign_204%	Your plans are a bit antiquated.
%both_precampaign_205%	I'm afraid so. It'd be better if you surrender now.
%both_precampaign_209%	Not wrong but... Dahlia's program suits our needs better.
%both_precampaign_211%	That's an euphemism for "you're siding with the old hags."
%both_precampaign_212%	But I'm not an old hag! Doesn't that count for something?
%both_precampaign_213%	I believe that the old Witches are using you to whitewash the power they exert over the coven.
%both_precampaign_215%	I'm not in cahoots with anyone, I swear!
%both_precampaign_216%	We didn't say that.
%both_precampaign_217%	But let's acknowledge that your program is pretty convenient for the old lot.
%both_precampaign_219%	Maybe that's just an indicator of how sensible my program is, don't you think?
%both_precampaign_221%	Yeah, sensible and retrograde.
%both_precampaign_225%	Your plans are a bit antiquated.
%both_precampaign_229%	I'm afraid so. It'd be better if you surrender now.
%both_precampaign_231%	Fortuna! How could you say that!?
%both_precampaign_232%	Yeah, dude. I'm all about belligerence, but that was a bit much.
%both_precampaign_234%	Ah, yes, you're right. I'm sorry. Got caught up in the moment.
%both_precampaign_238%	I'm with Jasmine on this.
%both_precampaign_239%	I just met with Patrice and after putting some thought into it, we've decided we'll support Jasmine during the campaign.
%both_precampaign_242%	Yaaaaay!
%both_precampaign_243%	What!? And Patrice too?
%both_precampaign_246%	That Witch is tough. Odds aren't looking that great for me, huh?
%both_precampaign_249%	Here's your prophecy: Your sister is about to make my life a lot harder.
%both_precampaign_251%	Well, who cares, I knew this wasn't going to be easy anyway.
%both_precampaign_252%	Are you alright? I thought you'd be more... explosive about all this.
%both_precampaign_253%	What do you want me to do...
%both_precampaign_254%	All my friends are ganging up on me. Excuse me if I'm not my usual exuberant self.
%both_precampaign_256%	Dahlia...
%both_precampaign_257%	Sorry, I didn't mean it that way.
%both_precampaign_258%	It's ok if you want to be angry, that's all I'll say. I'd understand.
%both_precampaign_259%	You'd like that, huh? Well, no, all I am is sour.
%both_precampaign_260%	This is war now. Better prepare yourselves, because I won't pull any punches.
%both_precampaign_261%	Come on, Dahlia... No need to paint it as a war.
%both_precampaign_263%	Maybe it's a game to you. But for many of us, this is our only chance in centuries to access a better existence.
%both_precampaign_265%	It's not a game to me either, what are you implying?
%both_precampaign_266%	And what's that about "a better existence?" You're saying that as if I'm not planning to make us all happy.
%both_precampaign_270%	Hey, friends. Let's take it easy. Why don't we deal with this the way it was intended?
%both_precampaign_272%	We have many debates and campaign actions ahead to prove our points.
%both_precampaign_273%	No need to get bloody right here right now.
%both_precampaign_276%	Sure.
%both_precampaign_277%	Yeah, we'd better...
%both_precampaign_279%	So this is it, huh?
%both_precampaign_280%	I'm afraid there won't be any more friendly get-togethers until we solve the shit out of this.
%both_precampaign_281%	Let's get to work.
%both_precampaign_282%	Good luck, everyone.
%both_precampaign_283%	Good luck!
%both_precampaign_284%	Let's all do our best.
%dahlia_precampaign_4%	Hey Fortuna, how are you doing?
%dahlia_precampaign_5%	Very well, thank you.
%dahlia_precampaign_6%	Why did you want to see me?
%dahlia_precampaign_7%	How direct, haha.
%dahlia_precampaign_8%	I get the feeling this isn't a social visit, is it?
%dahlia_precampaign_9%	My gut tells me shit is about to get real.
%dahlia_precampaign_10%	I guess you're right.
%dahlia_precampaign_11%	I wanted to tell you first-hand that we are officially supporting Jasmine.
%dahlia_precampaign_12%	Mmm, we?
%dahlia_precampaign_14%	Yeah, Patrice came to visit and seems to be pretty interested in kick-starting my political career, for some reason.
%dahlia_precampaign_15%	She even wanted me to run for the position of leader myself, but I'm not cut out for the spotlight.
%dahlia_precampaign_16%	Shit... Patrice, huh?
%dahlia_precampaign_18%	That Witch is tough. Odds aren't looking that great for me, huh?
%dahlia_precampaign_21%	Here's your prophecy: Your sister is about to make my life a lot harder.
%dahlia_precampaign_23%	Are you alright? I thought you'd be more... explosive about all this.
%dahlia_precampaign_24%	What do you want me to do...
%dahlia_precampaign_25%	All my friends are ganging up on me. Excuse me if I'm not my usual exuberant self.
%dahlia_precampaign_26%	Sorry, I didn't mean it that way.
%dahlia_precampaign_27%	It's ok if you want to be angry, that's all I'll say. I'd understand.
%dahlia_precampaign_28%	You'd like that, huh? Well, no, all I am is sour.
%dahlia_precampaign_29%	This is war now. Better prepare yourselves, because I won't pull any punches.
%dahlia_precampaign_32%	May the best Witch win.
%dahlia_precampaign_33%	Come on... it's not like that, we're still friends, right?
%dahlia_precampaign_37%	May the best Witch win.
%dahlia_precampaign_38%	May the best Witch win.
%dahlia_precampaign_43%	Come on... it's not like that, we're still friends, right?
%dahlia_precampaign_44%	Maybe after the race.
%dahlia_precampaign_45%	Take care.
%dahlia_precampaign_51%	FOR!
%dahlia_precampaign_53%	TU!
%dahlia_precampaign_55%	NA!
%dahlia_precampaign_56%	ARE YOU READY TO RULE THIS UNIVERSE!?
%dahlia_precampaign_57%	Hahahaha, great to see you pumped.
%dahlia_precampaign_59%	Hahahaha.
%dahlia_precampaign_60%	I can't wait to take this coven by storm.
%dahlia_precampaign_61%	With that energy I'm afraid you will, haha.
%dahlia_precampaign_63%	So, here's what I need you to do.
%dahlia_precampaign_64%	Uh... about that.
%dahlia_precampaign_65%	Don't fret, it'll be easy.
%dahlia_precampaign_66%	No, it's not that...
%dahlia_precampaign_67%	What's the matter?
%dahlia_precampaign_68%	It seems that in the end we're going to be on Jasmine's side.
%dahlia_precampaign_70%	What?
%dahlia_precampaign_71%	...
%dahlia_precampaign_72%	And who's "we"?
%grethe_lay_precampaign_2%	Who was that?
%grethe_lay_precampaign_3%	Sounded pretty intense.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_4%	Ah... My sister Patrice came by.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_5%	What? And didn't you think to introduce me?
%grethe_lay_precampaign_7%	Is it because you don't want her to know your girlfriend is infected with a Behemoth?
%grethe_lay_precampaign_8%	No, that'll be alright I think. She's loyal and discreet.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_10%	I do want you to meet her. But the situation was too tense to bring you up...
%grethe_lay_precampaign_11%	She's coming back in a bit so we'll do the introductions later.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_12%	Ah, ok, cool. Is everything alright?
%grethe_lay_precampaign_15%	My sister is dead set on turning me into the next leader of our coven.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_18%	My sister is dead set on hamfisting me into the political race.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_19%	She wants us to help Dahlia become the next leader and set me up as her right hand Witch.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_22%	My sister is dead set on hamfisting me into the political race.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_23%	She wants us to help Jasmine become the next leader and set me up as her right hand Witch.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_25%	Oh, wow. Wow.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_26%	She believes I could do a lot of good for the coven with my cards.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_27%	Well, that's a fabulous idea, provided you're fine with it, babe.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_28%	And not only because of your cards. You're smart and caring, you've only had this new deck for a few weeks and you've already helped a lot of people.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_29%	Myself included.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_30%	It'd be great to have someone so kind-hearted yet powerful as you at the helm for a change.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_31%	I'm not as selfless as you think.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_32%	I'm an egoist. I'm full of wrath. I am a mess.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_33%	Aren't we all, though?
%grethe_lay_precampaign_34%	The important thing is that you can overcome all of that. When it matters most, you do good.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_35%	I don't know...
%grethe_lay_precampaign_36%	Let me help you.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_37%	I can work with the team, help move the campaign.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_38%	That'd be great. I'll feel stronger with you at my side...
%grethe_lay_precampaign_41%	Can I ask you to keep me in check if I lose my way?
%grethe_lay_precampaign_42%	One of the things that scares me the most about going into politics is the idea of losing myself to ambition, crossing a line I shouldn't... I don't know.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_43%	You can count on me.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_44%	Look, I've come up with a mission for you already.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_45%	Whatever you need.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_46%	Hold me tight, please.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_47%	Hahaha, you got it.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_52%	But I'm afraid it wouldn't be a good idea for you to roam around with the Behemoth sticking out of your head...
%grethe_lay_precampaign_53%	Of course...
%grethe_lay_precampaign_54%	I'm sorry.
%grethe_lay_precampaign_55%	I'm sorry, Grethe...
%grethe_lay_precampaign_56%	There's something really important you can help with, though.
%jasmine_precampaign_2%	Thanks for coming, Jasmine.
%jasmine_precampaign_4%	Always a pleasure!
%jasmine_precampaign_8%	Getting used to your new situation?
%jasmine_precampaign_9%	You bet. In just a few weeks I'm getting more social activity than I had even before being exiled, haha.
%jasmine_precampaign_11%	That's good, you've got a lot of catching up to do with the coven.
%jasmine_precampaign_12%	Patrice came by, by the way.
%jasmine_precampaign_15%	Oh, yeah? How is she? I haven't seen her since you were exiled.
%jasmine_precampaign_16%	Yeah, she's been busy with work, you know her.
%jasmine_precampaign_17%	Haha, yeah, always so driven.
%jasmine_precampaign_18%	Her new thing is that she wants me to run for leader.
%jasmine_precampaign_20%	Oh! And are you?
%jasmine_precampaign_21%	Not exactly. We're teaming up with Dahlia. I'll become an advisor of sorts when she gets to rule the coven.
%jasmine_precampaign_23%	*If* she gets to rule the coven, you mean.
%jasmine_precampaign_24%	Yes, of course. I'm sorry.
%jasmine_precampaign_26%	Ah... How did we end up in this situation... Couldn't we all just, I don't know, run together?
%jasmine_precampaign_29%	Sure, join us!
%jasmine_precampaign_30%	Our agendas don't align too well...
%jasmine_precampaign_34%	Sure, join us!
%jasmine_precampaign_35%	Ah, I wish...
%jasmine_precampaign_37%	But I've put too much effort into this.
%jasmine_precampaign_39%	I truly believe I can make a change, make us all happier.
%jasmine_precampaign_40%	I have no doubt about that.
%jasmine_precampaign_41%	Just...
%jasmine_precampaign_43%	Promise me we'll still be friends, whatever happens.
%jasmine_precampaign_44%	Always. Don't you worry about that.
%jasmine_precampaign_46%	I love you.
%jasmine_precampaign_47%	I love you too.
%jasmine_precampaign_48%	Well, I'd better go and start preparing, then.
%jasmine_precampaign_49%	I'm up against three of the most formidable Witches I've ever known, after all.
%jasmine_precampaign_50%	Good luck, Jasmine.
%jasmine_precampaign_52%	Yeah, you too.
%jasmine_precampaign_57%	Our agendas don't align too well...
%jasmine_precampaign_59%	Of course... I understand.
%jasmine_precampaign_61%	And I won't change my program for anything.
%jasmine_precampaign_66%	Ah... I'm so nervous for the race.
%jasmine_precampaign_68%	But knowing that you're on my team, I've got nothing to fear, hehe.
%jasmine_precampaign_69%	Yeah... about that.
%jasmine_precampaign_71%	Patrice came to visit me.
%patrice_first_visit_2%	Hello, Fortuna.
%patrice_first_visit_3%	Oh, no... you're upset.
%patrice_first_visit_4%	At this point I'd say I'm more disillusioned than upset.
%patrice_first_visit_5%	When were you planning on telling me you can accept visitors?
%patrice_first_visit_8%	Ah... things have been complicated.
%patrice_first_visit_9%	I didn't want to worry you until I figured out this mess.
%patrice_first_visit_10%	I didn't know I had to report my every movement to you.
%patrice_first_visit_14%	Ah... things have been complicated.
%patrice_first_visit_15%	This is such a pattern.
%patrice_first_visit_16%	I don't know why you keep pushing me away when things get "complicated."
%patrice_first_visit_20%	I didn't want to worry you until I figured out this mess.
%patrice_first_visit_21%	So you managed to get yourself into a new mess even in exile.
%patrice_first_visit_22%	I don't know why I even keep caring at this point.
%patrice_first_visit_26%	I didn't know I had to report my every movement to you.
%patrice_first_visit_27%	Oh, don't worry. You've made that clear numerous times throughout multiple existences.
%patrice_first_visit_29%	What do I need to do for you to let your big sister in?
%patrice_first_visit_30%	Have I ever failed you?
%patrice_first_visit_31%	Patrice, come on... I've explained this to you too many times already.
%patrice_first_visit_32%	You are in. It's just that I don't like to be "saved."
%patrice_first_visit_33%	And you're always too quick to make my own problems your own.
%patrice_first_visit_34%	I want you to be my friend, not my mom.
%patrice_first_visit_35%	Although not even our mom intruded as much as you do.
%patrice_first_visit_36%	Oh, I know. Who do you think changed your diapers and took you to school?
%patrice_first_visit_37%	Ah... not this again.
%patrice_first_visit_38%	Listen, it's been two centuries since I last saw you.
%patrice_first_visit_39%	Why don't we skip this part and cut to the tense and cordial conversation.
%patrice_first_visit_40%	Mmph... Fine.
%patrice_first_visit_45%	Mmm...
%patrice_first_visit_47%	How's work?
%patrice_first_visit_48%	How's Juliette doing? You still together?
%patrice_first_visit_49%	Are you still checking on your descendants?
%patrice_first_visit_50%	(Enough catching up.)
%patrice_first_visit_54%	How's work?
%patrice_first_visit_62%	Oh, you know, keeping up with the thrilling life of the archivist.
%patrice_first_visit_63%	Why don't you switch jobs if you find it so dull?
%patrice_first_visit_65%	No, no. I mean it.
%patrice_first_visit_66%	At first I took it because I needed to come to terms with this new reality you dragged me into.
%patrice_first_visit_67%	But now I'm hooked.
%patrice_first_visit_68%	Occult sciences--actual occult I mean, not Earth's esoterism--are so stimulating.
%patrice_first_visit_69%	Feels like picking reality apart.
%patrice_first_visit_70%	Like I'm on the verge of a scientific breakthrough everyday.
%patrice_first_visit_71%	I'm this close to start writing my own treaties. I'm eager to blow some Witches' minds with the reframing of the occult I'm thinking about.
%patrice_first_visit_72%	Whoa, that sounds exciting, alright.
%patrice_first_visit_74%	Will you read it?
%patrice_first_visit_75%	Of course, you don't need to ask!
%patrice_first_visit_76%	Well, you didn't read a single novel of mine back when we were mortals.
%patrice_first_visit_77%	Ah... I'm not as interested in lesbian pulp novels as I am in occult stuff.
%patrice_first_visit_78%	Fair enough... I guess.
%patrice_first_visit_81%	Mmm... weird. Not that attractive right now.
%patrice_first_visit_82%	Why's that?
%patrice_first_visit_83%	I may put the detective work on hold for a while.
%patrice_first_visit_84%	With the upcoming elections I've been getting a lot of unsavory requests.
%patrice_first_visit_85%	I'm not in the mood for digging up dirt or spying on people.
%patrice_first_visit_86%	Not for a third party, at least.
%patrice_first_visit_87%	What do you mean "a third party"?
%patrice_first_visit_88%	Ah... We'll get to that in a bit.
%patrice_first_visit_89%	I don't know if I like the sound of that.
%patrice_first_visit_92%	Pretty exciting, to be honest.
%patrice_first_visit_94%	Me and my team have been exploring one of the known edges of this universe.
%patrice_first_visit_95%	Oh, shit, that sounds dangerous.
%patrice_first_visit_96%	We've located the Forbidden Door to Pleasure.
%patrice_first_visit_97%	Don't fret, we know the story, none of us is looking through the keyhole.
%patrice_first_visit_98%	But... I gotta say I feel like I could endure it.
%patrice_first_visit_99%	I used most of my mortal life to explore every corner of hedonism.
%patrice_first_visit_100%	Interacting with that door feels like the next logical step.
%patrice_first_visit_101%	Ah... on the one hand I want to talk you out of it.
%patrice_first_visit_102%	But on the other... I also believe you are destined to tame that door.
%patrice_first_visit_103%	I might... Not soon though.
%patrice_first_visit_105%	Not until the turmoil from the elections settles, at least.
%patrice_first_visit_109%	Stupendous, I'd say.
%patrice_first_visit_110%	While you've been "gone" we've managed to become one of the most popular publications among many covens.
%patrice_first_visit_111%	I even started overseeing a side editorial about magical technology which has been a hit among Witches of the Machina Cult.
%patrice_first_visit_112%	"10 modules you won't be able to live without once you've installed them in your Mech."
%patrice_first_visit_113%	I know, I know. I'm not proud of those kinds of headlines, but they work wonders.
%patrice_first_visit_114%	Hahaha, I'm sure.
%patrice_first_visit_115%	I find them dumb, too. But I gotta say, Cosmic Gazette's "Top Five Trinkets of the Week" is one of my favorite sections, hahaha.
%patrice_first_visit_116%	I know. We should stop trying to play it smart and embrace our love for random lists.
%patrice_first_visit_117%	For this year's special we may even go full bait. "Top 10 Best Lists in the Cosmos."
%patrice_first_visit_118%	I'm looking forward to it.
%patrice_first_visit_120%	And to think I used to be a best-selling author back on Earth... heh.
%patrice_first_visit_125%	How's Juliette doing? Are you still together?
%patrice_first_visit_126%	Ah... no, that had to end.
%patrice_first_visit_127%	We broke up about fifty years ago.
%patrice_first_visit_128%	What happened?
%patrice_first_visit_129%	She went and joined the Arbitrage Office willingly. Can you believe it?
%patrice_first_visit_130%	Whoa, why did she do that?
%patrice_first_visit_131%	She was overwhelmed by... what being a Witch implies.
%patrice_first_visit_132%	All that freedom, the directionlessness.
%patrice_first_visit_133%	She depended a lot on me to decide how to use her time, but I'm not the kind to become anyone's "conductor."
%patrice_first_visit_134%	She was fine whenever she was busy. But every time I needed my space she had severe episodes of anxiety and depression.
%patrice_first_visit_135%	She knew she was hurting us both, so in the end her solution was to forego her freedom.
%patrice_first_visit_136%	From what she's told to me in her letters, becoming an Arbiter gave her a mission and a purpose.
%patrice_first_visit_137%	What a shame. Well, whatever works, I guess.
%patrice_first_visit_138%	Existential dread is a widespread disease among Witches.
%patrice_first_visit_139%	The irony of immortality.
%patrice_first_visit_140%	Heh...
%patrice_first_visit_145%	Are you still checking on your descendants?
%patrice_first_visit_146%	Nah, I got bored a couple of generations ago.
%patrice_first_visit_147%	It was important to me to veil over María Fortuna, Eric, Michael, and the rest.
%patrice_first_visit_148%	And I was genuinely curious about how they raised their children, what became of them all.
%patrice_first_visit_149%	I don't know, the ego trip of witnessing one's legacy.
%patrice_first_visit_150%	But at some point it lost all meaning, just became voyeurism. Watching strangers go about their lives.
%patrice_first_visit_151%	They stopped talking about you, huh.
%patrice_first_visit_153%	Shut up.
%patrice_first_visit_154%	Hahaha... I know you too well.
%patrice_first_visit_156%	Prick.
%patrice_first_visit_160%	What about you?
%patrice_first_visit_161%	What have you done this time?
%patrice_first_visit_162%	What are you implying?
%patrice_first_visit_163%	Something embarrassing, dangerous, or illegal, I'm sure.
%patrice_first_visit_166%	Ábramar. Show yourself.
%patrice_first_visit_167%	An Arbiter revised my sentence, that's all.
%patrice_first_visit_168%	I'm fine. Let it go.
%patrice_first_visit_172%	An Arbiter revised my sentence, that's all.
%patrice_first_visit_175%	I'm fine. Let it go.
%patrice_first_visit_177%	Bullshit.
%patrice_first_visit_178%	You can't lie to me.
%patrice_first_visit_179%	I know something's off because otherwise I wouldn't have had to find out for myself that you regained visitation privileges.
%patrice_first_visit_180%	And what's more, that you have a brand new Tarot.
%patrice_first_visit_181%	It's not Tarot.
%patrice_first_visit_182%	Even worse.
%patrice_first_visit_183%	What have you done? There must be a reason you wanted me out of your hair.
%patrice_first_visit_186%	Fine. Ábramar, show yourself.
%patrice_first_visit_187%	Ok. You're right. But I'm not telling you.
%patrice_first_visit_191%	Ok. You're right. But I'm not telling you.
%patrice_first_visit_192%	Tell me.
%patrice_first_visit_195%	No.
%patrice_first_visit_196%	FINE. (Summon Ábramar).
%patrice_first_visit_200%	No.
%patrice_first_visit_201%	Why?
%patrice_first_visit_204%	It's too dangerous.
%patrice_first_visit_205%	Because I don't want to.
%patrice_first_visit_206%	It's better if you don't know.
%patrice_first_visit_210%	It's too dangerous.
%patrice_first_visit_211%	That's my problem.
%patrice_first_visit_212%	No, it's not. It's my problem, not yours.
%patrice_first_visit_216%	Because I don't want to.
%patrice_first_visit_217%	Stop being so childish.
%patrice_first_visit_218%	You're the one being childish! Leave me alone.
%patrice_first_visit_222%	It's better if you don't know.
%patrice_first_visit_223%	You're just giving me more reasons to pry.
%patrice_first_visit_225%	Just let me help you, why are you like this.
%patrice_first_visit_228%	OK, YOU ASKED FOR IT. (Show Ábramar)
%patrice_first_visit_229%	I SAID NO.
%patrice_first_visit_233%	I SAID NO.
%patrice_first_visit_236%	WHY DID YOU TURN ME INTO A WITCH THEN!?
%patrice_first_visit_237%	I did not "turn" you into a Witch! You were destined to become one! How many times do we have to go over this!?
%patrice_first_visit_238%	I just read the cards!
%patrice_first_visit_239%	...
%patrice_first_visit_240%	Wait...
%patrice_first_visit_241%	What?
%patrice_first_visit_242%	Oh my god...
%patrice_first_visit_244%	Are you alright?
%patrice_first_visit_245%	I did turn you into a Witch!
%patrice_first_visit_246%	Oh my god, oh my god...
%patrice_first_visit_247%	I'm so sorry, Patrice.
%patrice_first_visit_248%	What are you on about?
%patrice_first_visit_249%	What? You're sorry now? What is going on?
%patrice_first_visit_250%	Oh, shit, your bone cancer...
%patrice_first_visit_251%	Oh, shit. Oh, my fucking life.
%patrice_first_visit_252%	Fortuna. Easy.
%patrice_first_visit_253%	I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.
%patrice_first_visit_254%	I... I recently learned something about my divination that... well, it changes everything.
%patrice_first_visit_255%	What is going on?
%patrice_first_visit_256%	I'm not a reader. I'm a writer.
%patrice_first_visit_257%	What the hell does that mean?
%patrice_first_visit_258%	Aedana's corpse visited me recently.
%patrice_first_visit_259%	She told me why she sent me into exile and why she took away my deck.
%patrice_first_visit_260%	I'm not seeing the future, I'm deciding it. Forging what's ahead.
%patrice_first_visit_261%	I killed you.
%patrice_first_visit_262%	Whoa, whoa, slow down.
%patrice_first_visit_263%	First of all, we were kids. You're not responsible for my fate no matter the forces behind it.
%patrice_first_visit_264%	I gave you fucking cancer.
%patrice_first_visit_265%	Hey! Shut it.
%patrice_first_visit_266%	I had a great life. If not cancer, it would have been a truck, or the aftermath of all the drugs I did.
%patrice_first_visit_267%	I do not hold you accountable for any of that.
%patrice_first_visit_268%	Still... I'm so sorry.
%patrice_first_visit_269%	And then, you're right. You've always been right.
%patrice_first_visit_270%	I turned you into a Witch. I couldn't bear you dying and I dragged your soul into space.
%patrice_first_visit_271%	Well... I do hold you accountable for that.
%patrice_first_visit_272%	Not that I hate it, being a Witch. It beats eternal slumber.
%patrice_first_visit_273%	However, I think you owe me. You must let me in.
%patrice_first_visit_274%	You wanted me back in your life so bad you pulled me out of death's embrace.
%patrice_first_visit_275%	Now own it.
%patrice_first_visit_276%	This is too much, Patrice.
%patrice_first_visit_277%	I don't want to read the cards anymore, the responsibility is overwhelming.
%patrice_first_visit_278%	...
%patrice_first_visit_280%	Ah...
%patrice_first_visit_281%	Listen.
%patrice_first_visit_282%	I see how your powers present quite an ethical conundrum.
%patrice_first_visit_283%	But we're not on Earth anymore.
%patrice_first_visit_285%	I haven't met a single Witch that isn't fucking overpowered and exploiting her abilities to satisfy her ambitions.
%patrice_first_visit_286%	You're like a superwitch, so what. Use your powers to do good or whatever.
%patrice_first_visit_287%	I don't know, Patrice.
%patrice_first_visit_288%	Moreover, I believe you should act on it. Like that spider guy that Eva liked.
%patrice_first_visit_289%	"Having great power and not using it is irresponsible."
%patrice_first_visit_290%	Hahahaha, it doesn't go like that.
%patrice_first_visit_292%	No?
%patrice_first_visit_293%	Well, you get me.
%patrice_first_visit_294%	But where do I draw the line?
%patrice_first_visit_295%	Case by case.
%patrice_first_visit_296%	I know you're a good person. I'm not afraid of letting you tamper with fate.
%patrice_first_visit_298%	Read the cards for me, come on.
%patrice_first_visit_299%	Really? What about?
%patrice_first_visit_300%	Read into my end.
%patrice_first_visit_301%	What!? No!!
%patrice_first_visit_302%	Come on, we all have an expiry date. Even Witches.
%patrice_first_visit_303%	Write me a beautiful death.
%patrice_first_visit_304%	Patrice...
%patrice_first_visit_305%	You know, being aware of how I was meant to die gave me superpowers back when I was a mortal.
%patrice_first_visit_306%	It is weird, but I miss that powerful dread.
%patrice_first_visit_307%	Please, Fortuna. Grant me illumination once again.
%patrice_first_visit_308%	...
%patrice_first_visit_309%	Alright.
%patrice_first_visit_310%	I love you, Patrice.
%patrice_first_visit_312%	I love you too.
%patrice_first_visit_317%	Fine. Show yourself, Ábramar.
%patrice_first_visit_320%	OK, YOU ASKED FOR IT.
%patrice_first_visit_321%	Show yourself, Ábramar.
%patrice_first_visit_326%	Holy fuck, Fortuna.
%patrice_first_visit_327%	A motherfucking BEHEMOTH!?
%patrice_first_visit_328%	Pleased to meet you, Patrice.
%patrice_first_visit_329%	AND IT TALKS!?
%patrice_first_visit_330%	What do you mean "it talks"? We Behemoths fucking invented language.
%patrice_first_visit_331%	And I'm not an "it", please refer to me as "he."
%patrice_first_visit_333%	What have you done, Fortuna...
%patrice_first_visit_336%	I did what I had to do to survive.
%patrice_first_visit_337%	I'm sorry, I was desperate...
%patrice_first_visit_341%	I did what I had to do to survive.
%patrice_first_visit_343%	Survive!? This will get you executed! Erased from the cosmos!
%patrice_first_visit_344%	I was living death anyway.
%patrice_first_visit_345%	200 years alone on this rock is worse than oblivion, Patrice...
%patrice_first_visit_347%	Ah... Who could blame you, really...
%patrice_first_visit_349%	Fucking Aedana.
%patrice_first_visit_353%	I'm sorry, I was desperate...
%patrice_first_visit_354%	Shit...
%patrice_first_visit_356%	I swear, I'm going to find Aedana's corpse and give her a postmortem kick in the ass.
%patrice_first_visit_357%	This is on her.
%patrice_first_visit_358%	I'm sorry.
%patrice_first_visit_359%	What's done is done.
%patrice_first_visit_360%	Now we have to figure out how to keep you alive.
%patrice_first_visit_361%	Because something this big is destined to leak.
%patrice_first_visit_362%	And I'm not about to let my little sister get wiped from existence.
%patrice_first_visit_365%	We have to use the elections as an opportunity to save your ass.
%patrice_first_visit_366%	I can start by calling in some favors, see if we can get you in the running...
%patrice_first_visit_367%	Patrice.
%patrice_first_visit_368%	What.
%patrice_first_visit_369%	You're doing it again. Stop.
%patrice_first_visit_370%	This is my mess, I can handle it.
%patrice_first_visit_371%	You can't handle shit. Look at the situation you've gotten yourself into.
%patrice_first_visit_372%	I've been a Witch for decades longer than you. I don't need your lessons.
%patrice_first_visit_373%	You may have been my big sister back on Earth, but not anymore.
%patrice_first_visit_374%	In fact, you're the little sister now. Know your place.
%patrice_first_visit_376%	What did you just say, you ungrateful piece of shit!?
%patrice_first_visit_377%	You heard me. It's my turn to protect you.
%patrice_first_visit_378%	Just by colluding with me on this Behemoth issue, you could be punished too.
%patrice_first_visit_379%	I didn't even tell my best friends. That's why I didn't want to get you involved.
%patrice_first_visit_381%	The fucking nerve.
%patrice_first_visit_382%	I don't need your help. The sooner you get that into your head, the better.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_2%	Fortuna.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_4%	LET'S RULE THIS UNIVERSE TOGETHER!
%politics_analysis_dahlia_5%	Hahahaha.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_7%	That's the spirit.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_9%	Is this a winning team or what!? Hahaha.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_10%	Your energy has won us half the race already.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_12%	Let's get right to it.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_14%	How are you feeling, Fortuna?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_17%	Fine. Relaxed.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_18%	Ready. Focused.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_19%	Excited. Eager to start.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_20%	Awful. Anxious.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_21%	Terrified.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_25%	Fine. Relaxed.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_28%	Ready. Focused.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_31%	Excited. Eager to start.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_34%	Awful. Anxious.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_37%	Terrified.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_39%	Good.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_40%	Hold on to that fuel.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_41%	Did you meet with Jasmine?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_43%	Yeah, we did.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_44%	Yeah? And how did she take it?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_47%	It was intense, but I believe we're fine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_48%	Jasmine wasn't really happy about it...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_52%	It was intense, but I believe we're fine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_53%	Really?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_55%	Yeah, I don't know. We've been through worse.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_56%	This is but another rough patch.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_57%	We're bound to clash from time to time, it's the price of friendship when immortal.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_58%	Eventually this will become just another memory to rehash while getting high in her garden.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_60%	Good to hear.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_65%	Jasmine wasn't really happy about it...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_66%	It's only natural.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_67%	I'm sure she's terrified now she knows we've all teamed up against her.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_69%	Hey, go against the best, lose like the rest. Am I right?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_71%	Heh, I see you don't feel even a bit of guilt.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_76%	I met her on my own, to avoid any tense situations between the three of us.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_77%	Yeah? And how did she take it?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_80%	It was intense, but I believe we're fine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_81%	She left so dejected, I feel bad.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_85%	It was intense, but I believe we're fine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_86%	Really?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_87%	Well, she said that she loves me and wishes us luck.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_88%	By all Daemons, she's ready for battle I tell you.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_89%	You think so?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_91%	"I love you and good luck" is Jasmine's signature veiled threat, hahaha.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_93%	The game's on!
%politics_analysis_dahlia_95%	Well, in any case it's good that you're not gonna take pity on her.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_97%	Ah, no. I respect Jasmine too much for that.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_98%	She's going to be a worthy adversary.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_102%	She left so dejected, I feel bad.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_103%	Well, that's only natural.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_104%	Hah! Don't feel bad.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_106%	Jasmine's stronger than you and me combined, Fortuna.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_107%	You think so?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_108%	Trust me. She is the oldest Witch among us, she's seen a lot.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_112%	Ok. Do you want to take the lead, Dahlia?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_114%	I've got you! Let's do this!
%politics_analysis_dahlia_115%	What's the plan?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_116%	Let's go out there and start spreading the wonders of our program!
%politics_analysis_dahlia_117%	Uh... Don't you think it'll be better if we strategize a bit first?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_119%	What is there left to plan?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_120%	Everything?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_122%	Mmm... I'm more the kind of Witch that works with her gut.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_123%	That's alright. It's a great asset to have a leader with sharp instincts.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_124%	But do you mind if I take care of the most boring analytical parts?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_125%	Ok, ok. I understand. The floor is yours.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_126%	I say we analyze our opponents first. Then I'll interview you two to see where we stand on the main issues.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_127%	After that, we can review our program. Once we get to something solid we should schedule some campaign actions to get the ball rolling.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_128%	The date for the election congress hasn't been decided yet, but we're against the clock as of now.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_129%	How does that sound?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_130%	Smart, you're right.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_131%	I'm ready.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_132%	Good.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_133%	First of all, to check we're all up to speed.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_134%	Fortuna, did someone tell you about the five pillars of the coven?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_135%	You know: Judgment, Law Enforcement, Forbidden Arts, Mortal Affairs, and Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_140%	Do you need me to explain them to you?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_143%	I know about them. You can skip the explanation.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_144%	I heard about them. But explain it to me again, please.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_148%	I know about them. You can skip the explanation.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_152%	I don't know what you're talking about.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_154%	Really?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_155%	Yes, I'm sorry...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_156%	Dahlia, you didn't explain your program to my sister when you asked her to join you?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_157%	No. But that's what we're gonna do now, right?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_158%	The fundamental question was if she wanted to support my campaign.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_159%	That's on me. It's my fault for getting into all this without asking.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_161%	Ah... ok. Allow me to explain, in any case.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_164%	I heard about them. But explain it to me again, please.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_165%	Thorough, that's good.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_166%	Here's the deal:
%politics_analysis_dahlia_168%	There are five key directives that keep our coven's cogs churning.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_170%	As I said: Judgment, Law Enforcement, Forbidden Arts, Mortal Affairs, and Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_171%	Make good note of them.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_172%	Judgment is about how we deal with conflicts within the coven, how we determine who's at fault and such.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_173%	It's also the executive branch: Where the coven is going and how we deal with major events.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_175%	Until now we've had Runic Judgment. Which basically consisted of Aedana consulting with the gods, and us blindly swallowing whatever she fed us.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_176%	Then we have Law Enforcement.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_178%	That is how the coven punishes anyone who did something wrong or forbidden, as determined by Judgment.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_179%	Right now, as you are well aware, we send infractors to exile for a variable amount of time depending on the severity of their actions.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_180%	Can our slogan be "Fuck you, exile"?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_183%	Very punk, it may work, haha.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_184%	Hahahaha.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_186%	Just kidding.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_188%	Next is Forbidden Arts.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_189%	That's how we deal with perilous magic and knowledge, such as summoning Behemoths, necromancy, etc.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_191%	The current directive is that when the coven determines that something could put our community at risk, we ban it.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_192%	Let me tell you, the age of fear is about to end.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_193%	Then there's Mortal Affairs.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_194%	That's how we deal with humans and... as traditionally put: other "lesser beings."
%politics_analysis_dahlia_195%	Lesser beings as in animals, or any lifeform that doesn't have access to magic, actually. Fuck that term, by the way.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_197%	Aedana determined that mortals should be exploited and manipulated at Witches convenience.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_198%	Did you know that Aedana wanted to cause World War III on Earth?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_200%	What!? Why?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_201%	To harvest energy from mortals.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_203%	Hahaha, piece of shit. I'm so happy that she's dead.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_205%	Fucking bastard. We still have a celebration pending to send her off to hell.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_206%	Hahaha, you bet.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_209%	Ahem... Last item: Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_210%	That defines what obligations members have to the coven.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_212%	Right now we have those obnoxious quarterly controls Aedana imposed on us to check on our progress.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_213%	You skipped them thanks to exile, but damn if they haven't been a pain in the ass...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_214%	Also, should a Witch fail to deliver, they'll eventually lose their membership. Imagine the strain that's put on many of our sisters.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_215%	I would have gladly done my homework in exchange for freedom, though.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_216%	I know, but still...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_217%	Luckily the controls are suspended until after the elections, and many of us are hoping they will be canceled forever.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_218%	You bet they will be.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_219%	Nice.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_220%	That's all five of them, right?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_221%	Yes.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_222%	But for these elections there's an additional, critical point to the race:
%politics_analysis_dahlia_223%	What to do with Aedana's corpse.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_224%	Oh, right.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_225%	The coven is divided between devouring her, making the hundred members that we are right now become more powerful.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_226%	Or scattering her remains throughout the cosmos so more Witches can ascend, making the coven more diverse.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_227%	There's no actual dilemma here, though.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_229%	I wouldn't eat that bitch's corpse even if you baked her into a chocolate cake.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_231%	We need to open our doors to more Witches! Let's turn Aedana into something good!
%politics_analysis_dahlia_232%	Alright, understood.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_233%	I don't have strong opinions about it. Whatever you think is best.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_234%	Anyway, internalize these issues, take your time.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_235%	Let me know when you are ready to continue.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_236%	Done?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_238%	Done.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_240%	Good. Let's start dissecting our rivals then.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_241%	Here's the intel I gathered on Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_243%	Jasmine was born in a small English town during the Industrial Revolution, circa 1800.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_244%	That put her in a cultural sweet spot for amassing the sympathies of the coven.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_245%	She's a young Witch in the eyes of the eldest, medieval and ancient Witches, but not so alien as us contemporanean Witches with our world wars, TV, internet, and other global "lunacies."
%politics_analysis_dahlia_246%	I don't really know what those are either.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_247%	Ah, yeah, sorry. You're not even from Earth to begin with.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_248%	The thing is, Jasmine gets along with us, but is also part of the "last decent generation," according to the most conservative Witches.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_249%	Her politics are a liberal revision of Aedana's, removing the most tyrannical mechanisms by reducing punishment and responsibilities.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_250%	That will maintain the status quo, but give more room for individualism and personal enterprise, free from many duties and the fear of failure.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_254%	Whoa, how did you manage to get all that info in so little time?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_260%	I'm an archivist and all this is public domain. No sweat.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_263%	Please, I'm a detective, sis. This was barely scratching the surface.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_266%	Enjoying the perks of having a journalist sister now, huh?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_268%	Now focus.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_272%	Her program to achieve this is:
%politics_analysis_dahlia_274%	Judgment will be performed by a quorum of the four eldest witches, in agreement with the leader.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_275%	That is the sweetest candy of her program for the old lot.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_277%	Enforcement will work with a system of strikes. She hasn't specified how many yet, but should a Witch accumulate enough warnings she will be expelled from the coven.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_278%	Way less radical than exile and the worst case scenario is the freedom to start anew elsewhere.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_280%	Regarding Forbidden Arts, she won't change a thing. Anything deemed dangerous by the eldest Witches will be banned.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_282%	Then, for Mortal Affairs, Jasmine proposes a model of protection and guidance.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_283%	What is good for humanity? What should we protect them from? I guess that'll be determined by the quorum of the eldest.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_285%	Lastly, as for Witch Duties, she proposes a policy of no vigilance.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_286%	Jasmine argues that we should trust every sister will have the coven's interests in mind and that there's no need to evaluate or impose any duties on any member.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_288%	And, of course, regarding the trending topic, Jasmine wants the coven to devour Aedana's corpse so we all become more powerful.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_289%	Take a minute to interiorize Jasmine's program.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_290%	Sure.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_291%	I'm impressed, Patrice. That's some amazing work.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_292%	Thank you.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_294%	Now tell me...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_295%	What can we do against this program?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_296%	I trust that everyone will see how our approach is far superior.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_298%	And if not, we'll make up for it by showing spirit!
%politics_analysis_dahlia_299%	Ah... I mean, spirit is important, yes.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_300%	But we need some strategies to have the upper hand dialectically.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_302%	Mmm...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_303%	Fortuna, any ideas?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_306%	What do you think is the best strategy to undermine Jasmine's program?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_309%	I don't want to undermine it, poor Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_310%	These lax policies will incentivize foul play.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_311%	These plans benefit the powerful and forsake novices.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_312%	Individualism will fracture the community.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_313%	Tradition and coven culture will vanish in this setup.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_318%	I don't want to undermine it, poor Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_319%	That won't float. It's imperative we challenge our opponent's ideals to get ahead.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_320%	Try again.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_324%	These lax policies will incentivize foul play.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_325%	Good point. Lack of consequences and no vigilance at all may lead to terrible events.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_326%	We can scare both conservatives and young voters away from Jasmine with this line of thought.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_330%	These plans benefit the powerful and forsake novices.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_331%	Mmm... interesting. If we adopt this strategy we may polarize the coven's opinion...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_332%	But in the long run we could gather the support of the young and weak plus the support of the most compassionate elders.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_333%	It may do the trick.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_337%	Individualism will fracture the community.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_338%	Absolutely. And a fractured sisterhood is a weak sisterhood, or no sisterhood at all, we could say.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_339%	That should weaken Jasmine's support and snatch many voters from her side, if we propose a sensible alternative.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_343%	Tradition and coven culture will vanish in this setup.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_344%	Oh, I wasn't expecting that kind of conservative approach.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_345%	Yeah, not a fan of it myself.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_346%	It could be an interesting weapon, depending on the context.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_347%	It would make a nice curve ball to gather support from traditionalists, if we need to attack the heart of Jasmine's target demographics.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_351%	Good. Good. Now to assess the candidate herself. Let's use our privileged info on Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_352%	What would you say is Jasmine's strongest point?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_353%	Mmm... She can be extremely cunning. That's what I'm most afraid of.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_354%	You're right to be on guard, yeah.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_355%	Fortuna?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_356%	What would you say is Jasmine's strongest point?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_359%	She's extremely intelligent and manipulative.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_360%	She is a pillar of the community.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_361%	Her apparent innocence and frailty.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_362%	Her resourcefulness.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_363%	Her charming mother-like aura.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_367%	She's extremely intelligent and manipulative.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_368%	She knows how to read people and how to work them for her interests.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_369%	Right? How does she do it?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_370%	Whoa, strong declarations coming from her friends.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_371%	I mean, she's really kind and thoughtful. I don't even think she does it on purpose most of the time, it's just her nature.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_372%	She has this way of talking you into things, though.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_373%	I understand.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_374%	This is the hardest quality to battle against. If we can't overpower her dialectically, we'll need to fight her with strong action.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_378%	She is a pillar of the community.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_379%	She helps and provides for many people with her garden, and has many contacts and friends.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_380%	Mmm... that sure puts her ahead in the race from the very start.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_381%	It'll be hard to win people's trust in Jasmine over to our side.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_382%	We‘ll need to undermine her capabilities as a leader and reinforce her status as a community provider so she stays like that, rather than as a ruler.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_386%	Her apparent innocence and frailty.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_387%	"Apparent," huh? I see where you're going with this.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_388%	She has this quality that makes anyone want to protect and support her.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_389%	Yeah, even though she's tough as nails.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_390%	Yeah, I can see how she could become a saint-like figure. An innocent martyr that is devoted to her coven.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_391%	Nothing but good will for her sisters. Let's follow Saint Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_392%	Haha, something like that, yeah.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_396%	Her resourcefulness.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_397%	She always manages to find a way out of any problem.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_398%	Plus her garden provides her with a great variety of tools to deal with just about any situation.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_399%	She has many contacts and smart ideas.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_400%	She's going to be hard to corner, I see.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_401%	But when it comes to resourcefulness I believe we have the upper hand.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_402%	I mean, with your divination on our side...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_403%	You bet. No surprise we both went directly to Fortuna to ask for her support in this race.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_404%	That's why I'm always on Fortuna's side.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_405%	I thought it was because I'm your sister.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_407%	Heh, yeah, that too.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_412%	Her charming mother-like aura.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_413%	Mmm... right. A mother figure could well become the prom queen of this race.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_414%	Many voters decide based on instinct rather than analysis. And Jasmine's persona promises to be an excellent caretaker for the lot of us.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_415%	We'll need to expose her ugly sides to distort those motherly attributes.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_416%	Do we really need to stoop that low?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_417%	I'd rather lose honorably.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_418%	Ok, ok. Your call.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_422%	Now to her flaws. What would you say is Jasmine's weakest point?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_423%	Combat. She's just not made for action.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_424%	Ah... well, I don't know if there will be a lot of opportunities during this campaign to show one's might, but yeah, duly noted.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_425%	What do you say, Fortuna?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_426%	What would you say is Jasmine's weakest point?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_429%	Her anxiety. She gets stressed easily.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_430%	Envy.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_431%	Her compassion.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_432%	She's easy to intimidate.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_433%	Vanity. She worries too much about appearances.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_437%	Her anxiety. She gets stressed easily.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_438%	Oooh, that's really easy to exploit. Good, good.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_439%	That's a flaw that will trigger almost automatically just by competing for leadership.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_440%	But we can push her buttons so she loses focus and messes up.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_444%	Envy.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_445%	Oooh, good one. Straight for the kill.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_446%	Really?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_447%	Yes, and she does a poor job hiding it.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_448%	Mmm... We should come up with creative ways of triggering her envy, then. This will come in very handy to cloud her judgment.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_452%	Her compassion.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_453%	Ah... Sweet Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_454%	That sounds more like a virtue, but you're right, compassion is something exploitable in its own way.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_455%	Taking pity on your rivals can be the ruin of a leader. We could also point out how some of her policies will cause suffering for some people.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_456%	We can throw her off her game by toying with her pity.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_460%	She is easy to intimidate.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_461%	Oof... that's one ugly road you're suggesting.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_462%	But should the situation get desperate for us we could try and scare her into place.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_463%	Eh... I wouldn't like to do anything bad to her.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_464%	Nothing aggressive, of course. But there are many ways to produce threats and fears to throw her off her game.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_465%	Still, let's try to avoid that course of action.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_466%	Ok.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_470%	Vanity. She worries too much about appearances.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_471%	Mmm... so if we manage to dig up some dirt on her we're sure to break her composure.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_472%	It'll be good to do some investigating and see if we can find something to throw her off her game.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_473%	Good to know.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_474%	Nothing untrue, though. That's my line in the sand, ok?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_475%	Gotcha.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_479%	Ah... I feel so bad doing this.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_480%	Toughen up, Fortuna. Her advisors will be doing the same about Dahlia, no doubt.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_481%	Plus, these are emergency resources. If we play our cards right we can hope for a clean victory.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_482%	Dahlia, focus on bringing your best game and I won't have to push any ugly buttons.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_483%	You're overthinking it. I've got this, team.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_484%	Damn, you're cool.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_486%	Hahahaha.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_488%	Shall we move onto Cupressa?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_489%	What? Who the hell is Cupressa?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_490%	Oh right, that old log is running for leader too.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_491%	No one truly thinks she poses any threat to Dahlia or Jasmine, but she is a candidate nonetheless.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_492%	We should study her. I believe this dark horse has a chance of surprising us all.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_493%	Tell me who she is already, come on.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_495%	Cupressa, The Historian Witch.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_496%	The eldest Witch in our coven. She precedes even Aedana. Cupressa is originally from Earth, but ascended way before humanity started even writing.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_497%	She has an infallible memory. All events are registered inside her tree rings.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_502%	She's been a really valuable source for the Cosmic Gazette. Cupressa has helped us many times with our articles.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_505%	We've worked together many times at the coven's archives. It's a neverending enterprise to register all her knowledge on paper.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_507%	The thing is that she's always played a secondary role in the coven, just supporting us with her wisdom.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_508%	But, apparently, Cupressa isn't a fan of change and isn't happy with the direction Jasmine or Dahlia want to take the coven, so for the first time she's running for leader.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_515%	Her program is easy to sum up: She wants to keep things exactly as Aedana left them.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_517%	Moreover, she advocates for preserving Aedana's corpse as some sort of oracle, to keep using her as a channel to consult with the gods and to set the direction for the coven.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_518%	Wow. Fuck Cupressa.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_519%	Fuck her, indeed.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_520%	Fuck her program, in any case. I know Cupressa personally and she is very kind and helpful. But yes, no one wants the ghost of Aedana to keep ruling over us.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_521%	She has very few supporters, all among the eldest. But I wouldn't underestimate her.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_522%	Cupressa has this special, mystical aura around her. Combined with her vast knowledge she's sure to impress many voters during the campaign.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_523%	But what I'm more afraid of is that, depending on how gruesome the race gets, we could scare some of the most conservative witches into switching sides from Jasmine to Cupressa.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_525%	I see...
%politics_analysis_dahlia_526%	As long as we don't underestimate Cupressa and keep her in check it all should be alright, I think.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_527%	Actually, I believe it's good that she's running.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_528%	From the warfare point of view, that's the best case scenario for us.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_529%	Divide and conquer.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_530%	If the conservative side is split between Cupressa and Jasmine, we can easily emerge as the dominant force.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_532%	Wow, your experience as a warrior Witch is going to come in handy.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_533%	We warrior Witches aren't all about smashing things, you know.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_534%	You need brains to take on the most challenging forces of the cosmos.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_535%	You have my respect.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_536%	Haha, don't underestimate Dahlia, Patrice.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_537%	I won't, I won't.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_539%	Anyway, I think we are ready to get into Dahlia's program now.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_540%	Do you want to take five?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_541%	I'm good.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_542%	Fortuna? How are you?
%politics_analysis_dahlia_545%	Let's take a break.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_546%	Nah, let's get this over with already.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_550%	Let's take a break.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_551%	Alright, we'll stay here reviewing our options.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_552%	Let me know when you're ready to move on.
%politics_analysis_dahlia_557%	Nah, let's get this over with already.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_2%	Hello, Fortuna!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_4%	I'm so happy we're doing this together!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_5%	We're going to be unstoppable!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_6%	Haha, I'll help in any way I can.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_8%	There's a lot of work to do.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_9%	Let's get right to it.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_10%	How are you feeling, Fortuna?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_13%	Fine. Relaxed.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_14%	Ready. Focused.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_15%	Excited. Eager to start.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_16%	Awful. Anxious.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_17%	Terrified.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_21%	Fine. Relaxed.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_24%	Ready. Focused.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_27%	Excited. Eager to start.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_30%	Awful. Anxious.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_33%	Terrified.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_35%	Good.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_36%	Hold on to that fuel.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_37%	I believe in you, Fortuna.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_38%	Did you meet with Dahlia?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_40%	Yes, we did.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_41%	Yeah? And how did she take it?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_44%	It was intense, but I believe we're fine.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_45%	Dahlia wasn't really happy about it...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_49%	It was intense, but I believe we're fine.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_50%	Really?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_52%	Well, she said some ugly things...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_53%	But that's how it always is with Dahlia, I guess.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_54%	I'm sure she didn't really mean it.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_55%	You need to be ready to keep facing mean comments, Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_56%	Things will only get more and more intense from this point onwards.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_58%	...I understand.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_62%	Dahlia wasn't really happy about it...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_63%	It's only natural.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_64%	I'm sure she's terrified now she knows we've all teamed up against her.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_66%	Oh, no... I feel so bad for her...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_67%	Shouldn't we maybe... invite her to surrender and join our party?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_69%	Haha, I love how cute-mean you can be.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_70%	But I wasn't really trying...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_71%	Oh, so it comes to you naturally, that's even better. It's gonna look great during debates.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_72%	Come on, Patrice, cut her some slack.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_74%	Sorry, not cutting any slack for anyone. I need you sharper and wittier than ever.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_75%	Understood?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_77%	...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_79%	Understood.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_83%	I met her on my own, to avoid any tense situations between the three of us.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_84%	Yeah? And how did she take it?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_87%	It was intense, but I believe we're fine.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_88%	She said that this is war now.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_92%	It was intense, but I believe we're fine.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_93%	Really?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_94%	Yeah... I think?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_95%	Surprisingly she didn't start a ruckus or anything.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_96%	I was expecting her to at least destroy the coffee table.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_97%	But she simply took in the harsh news and left.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_99%	Oh, no... that's not like her at all...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_100%	Do you think we've gone too far this time?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_102%	Hey. Snap out of it. She's not gonna take any pity on you during the race.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_103%	Until this is over, you are rivals before friends.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_104%	Understood?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_106%	...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_108%	Understood.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_112%	She said that this is war now.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_114%	WAR!?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_115%	Oh, no!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_116%	It's always love or war with Dahlia, you know her.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_117%	Although this time she wasn't her usual explosive self...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_119%	That's even scarier...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_123%	Ok. Do you want to take the lead, Jasmine?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_125%	Oh! Me!?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_126%	Yes. Aren't you the one who's running? What's the plan?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_128%	Mmm... I mean, I know what I want to do with the coven and what I want to say to our sisters so they vote for me but...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_130%	I didn't think I was going to be directing my own cabinet!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_131%	Don't get anxious. I can make this easy. If you tell me what you want I can handle strategy and the team.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_133%	That sounds nice, yeah!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_134%	Alright, I'll take the reins from here. Just stop me if you want me to do something differently.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_136%	Very well. Thank you.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_137%	Ok. We have to define a program and a plan.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_138%	First, we'll analyze our opponents and I'll interview you two to see where we stand on the main issues.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_139%	Then we'll sketch and review a program. Once we get to something solid we can schedule some campaign actions to get the ball rolling.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_140%	The date for the election congress hasn't been decided yet, but we're against the clock as of now.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_141%	All clear?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_142%	Yes, m'am.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_143%	Yes.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_144%	Good.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_145%	First of all, to check if we're all up to speed.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_146%	Fortuna, did someone tell you about the five pillars of the coven?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_147%	You know: Judgment, Law Enforcement, Forbidden Arts, Mortal Affairs, and Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_152%	Do you need me to explain them to you?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_155%	I know about them. You can skip the explanation.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_156%	I heard about them. But explain it to me again, please.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_160%	I know about them. You can skip the explanation.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_164%	I don't know what you're talking about.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_166%	Really?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_167%	Yes, I'm sorry...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_168%	Jasmine, you didn't explain your program to my sister when you asked her to join you?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_170%	Ah! I'm so sorry!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_171%	I should have explained better...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_172%	It's alright, it's my fault for getting into all this without asking.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_174%	You'll see! Everything is gonna go great! I have great plans!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_176%	Ah... ok. Allow me to explain, in any case.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_179%	I heard about them. But explain it to me again, please.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_180%	Thorough, that's good.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_181%	Here's the deal:
%politics_analysis_jasmine_183%	There are five key directives that keep our coven's cogs churning.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_185%	As I said: Judgment, Law Enforcement, Forbidden Arts, Mortal Affairs, and Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_186%	Make good note of them.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_187%	Judgment is about how we deal with conflicts within the coven, how we determine who's at fault and such.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_188%	It's also the executive branch: Where the coven is going and how we deal with major events.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_190%	Until now we've had Runic Judgment. Which basically consisted of Aedana consulting with the gods, and us blindly swallowing whatever she fed us.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_191%	Then we have Law Enforcement.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_193%	That's how the coven punishes anyone who did something wrong or forbidden, as determined by Judgment.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_194%	Right now, as you are well aware, we send infractors to exile for a variable amount of time depending on the severity of their actions.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_195%	Can our slogan be "Fuck you, exile"?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_198%	Very punk, it may work, haha.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_199%	How rude!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_201%	Just kidding.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_203%	Next is Forbidden Arts.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_204%	That's how we deal with perilous magic and knowledge, such as summoning Behemoths, necromancy, etc.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_206%	The current directive is that when the coven determines that something could put our community at risk, we ban it.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_207%	That's right. We don't want any trouble with the Arbitrage Office!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_208%	Then there's Mortal Affairs.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_209%	That's how we deal with humans and... as traditionally put: other "lesser beings."
%politics_analysis_jasmine_210%	Lesser beings as in animals, or any lifeform that doesn't have access to magic, actually. Fuck that term, by the way.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_212%	Aedana determined that mortals should be exploited and manipulated at Witches' convenience.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_213%	Did you know that Aedana wanted to cause World War III on Earth?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_215%	What!? Why?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_216%	To harvest energy from mortals.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_218%	Louise told me... I'm glad that's not an option anymore.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_220%	Fucking bastard. We still have a celebration pending to send her off to hell.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_221%	Hahaha, you bet.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_223%	Come on! I'm sure there's no need to go that far!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_225%	Also, we should get rid of that kind of talk if we want this campaign to succeed.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_226%	Ok, ok. Chill your tits, Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_227%	We're sorry, Jasmine. Please continue, Patrice.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_230%	Last item: Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_231%	That defines what obligations members have to the coven.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_233%	Right now we have those obnoxious quarterly controls Aedana imposed on us to check on our progress.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_234%	You skipped them thanks to exile, but damn if they haven't been a pain in the ass...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_235%	Also, should a Witch fail to deliver, they'll eventually lose their membership. Imagine the strain that's put on many of our sisters.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_236%	You bet, it's been a stressful few decades. I went mad obsessing over how to improve my garden.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_237%	I would have gladly done my homework in exchange for freedom, though.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_238%	I know, but still…
%politics_analysis_jasmine_239%	Luckily the controls are suspended until after the elections, and many of us are hoping they will be canceled forever.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_240%	We need to get rid of them, agreed.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_241%	Nice.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_242%	That's all five of them, right?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_243%	Yes.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_244%	But for these elections there's an additional, critical point to the race:
%politics_analysis_jasmine_245%	What to do with Aedana's corpse.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_246%	Oh, right.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_247%	The coven is divided between devouring her, making the hundred members that we are right now become more powerful.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_248%	Or scattering her remains throughout the cosmos so more Witches can ascend, making the coven more diverse.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_249%	We need to devour her. In these turbulent times what we need is power and unity.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_251%	And just to be extra clear, this is non-negotiable.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_253%	Alright, understood.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_254%	I don't have strong opinions about it. I'm fine with either becoming more powerful or welcoming more Witches.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_255%	Anyway, internalize these issues, take your time.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_256%	Let me know when you are ready to continue.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_257%	Done?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_259%	Done.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_261%	Good. Let's start dissecting our rivals then.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_262%	Here's the intel I gathered on Dahlia.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_264%	Dahlia's not from Earth. On our home planet, politics have evolved and twisted more than anywhere else in the explored universe.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_265%	She comes from the Daemonic Desertlands, where matriarchy-based warlordism and chieftainship are the primary form of organization, even nowadays.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_266%	I'm not saying to underestimate her, but we can expect her not to be well prepared to navigate the intricacies of a political campaign.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_267%	On the other hand, Dahlia's politics seem to be very different from her homeworld's.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_268%	From what I've gathered, her focus seems to be into collectivizing the coven's duties and responsibilities. Distributing the coven's power horizontally.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_269%	"Level the playing field" is practically her slogan.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_271%	Whoa, how did you manage to get all that info in so little time?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_277%	I'm an archivist and all this is public domain. No sweat.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_280%	Please, I'm a detective. This was barely scratching the surface.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_283%	Enjoying the perks of having a journalist sister now, huh?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_285%	Now focus.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_289%	Her program to achieve this is:
%politics_analysis_jasmine_291%	Judgment by referendum.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_292%	Dahlia argues that in a community this compact we should have to account for every member's input, regardless of their background or preparation.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_294%	Enforcement: None whatsoever. She believes in amicable resolution.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_295%	And should dialogue fail, she wants to leave the matter in the hands of the Arbitrage Office.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_296%	Her point being that we don't need to police ourselves when we already have the Magical Pact.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_298%	Forbidden Arts: Allow free access to any kind of magic, and control them through education, not banning.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_300%	Mortal Affairs: Cut all ties with mortals.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_301%	Dahlia believes we're too privileged to be messing with people's lives. She thinks we should just leave them be and focus on the cosmic and the magical.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_303%	Witch Duties: Magical tax.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_304%	Have every member of the coven share a percentage of their magic output to pool resources for the benefit of the clan.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_306%	And finally, she believes we should scatter Aedana's remains, so more Witches can ascend and our coven can become more diverse.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_307%	As you can see, Dahlia's betting on a kindhearted community that requires good will to work. Almost utopic, I must say.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_310%	And I always thought I was the naive one.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_312%	What would you say is the best strategy to counter Dahlia's stance?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_313%	Mmm... I don't know her as well as you do.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_314%	Fortuna?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_316%	What do you think is the best strategy to undermine Dahlia's program?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_319%	I don't want to undermine it, it's pretty cool.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_320%	Expose her naiveté. Faith in good intentions is ridiculous.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_321%	Horizontalism will make us slow and clumsy.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_322%	Point out the failure of communism on Earth.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_323%	Spotlight the primitive societies of her homeworld.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_328%	I don't want to undermine it, it's pretty cool.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_330%	That won't float. It's imperative we challenge our opponent's ideals to get ahead.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_331%	Try again.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_335%	Expose her naiveté. Faith in good intentions is ridiculous.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_336%	Good one. The ideal community she wants to paint a picture of isn't a reality.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_337%	We'll focus on conveying that to the rest of the coven.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_341%	Horizontalism will make us slow and clumsy.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_342%	A bit of an authoritarian stance, maybe, but if we offer a powerful alternative it'll work.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_343%	We'll need to come up with a power structure smart enough to overcome the illusion of horizontalism.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_347%	Point out the failure of communism on Earth.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_348%	Mmm... it may work. However, although the majority of Witches from our coven come from Earth, many of them predate the existence of communism.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_349%	Don't worry, we'll figure out a more universal approach.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_353%	Spotlight the primitive societies of her homeworld.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_354%	Ugh... Even if it's effective, that will paint us as elitist bitches. We need to be more agreeable to gather support.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_355%	Maybe there's a way to iron out that train of thought without compromising Jasmine's image. I'll think about it.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_359%	Ok, now. Let's capitalize on your intimate knowledge about your rival.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_361%	She's full of energy! She seems unstoppable!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_363%	And she's a bit scary too...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_365%	Powerful attributes for a leader figure, yeah.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_366%	What do you say, Fortuna?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_367%	What would you say is Dahlia's strongest point?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_370%	Her overwhelming charisma and the confidence she projects.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_371%	She embodies the winds of change.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_372%	Dahlia is pretty popular among young Witches.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_373%	Her determination. She is battle ready.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_374%	She is the most virtuous, the most incorruptible of us all.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_378%	Her overwhelming charisma and the confidence she projects.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_379%	Mmm... yeah, if this were a popularity contest she'd have the upper hand.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_380%	You think so?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_381%	Yup.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_382%	I'm sure her campaign will kick off with a lot of momentum.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_383%	We can't hope to defeat her on any revolutionary grounds.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_384%	We'll have to play up Jasmine's elegance and intelligence to get a bite of her cake.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_388%	She embodies the winds of change.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_389%	Anyone fed up with Aedana's abuse is likely to support Dahlia.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_390%	Mmm... good point.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_391%	And I don't think trying to be even more radical than her will pay off.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_392%	Our best bet is to offer change but mitigate the risk, a more conservative approach.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_393%	That sums up my stance pretty well, yes.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_397%	Dahlia is pretty popular among young Witches.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_398%	Mmm... I was thinking more about what her strongest attributes are as an individual.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_399%	But you're right, that may be Dahlia's strongest weapon for this campaign.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_400%	Young Witches account for at least a quarter of the coven's members.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_401%	We'll have to decide carefully whether to spend time trying to sweep votes from the novices or whether to directly focus our efforts on other demographics.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_402%	I don't know, there must be some sensible Witches among the novices, right?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_403%	We'll see. Depending on our program it might be a tough sell.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_407%	Her determination. She is battle ready.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_408%	Indeed. Dahlia is going to be hard to throw off her game.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_409%	Impossible to intimidate or overwhelm. She's likely to force us to be on defense rather than offense when dealing with her.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_410%	We can't expect to beat her on those grounds, but we need to at least aim to match her determination to get a bite of her cake.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_411%	It promises to be tough, but I believe in you two.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_415%	She is the most virtuous, the most incorruptible of us all.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_416%	Mmm... I'd say that feels more like Jasmine, don't you think?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_418%	Oh, my, thank you!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_419%	Well, Jasmine is a sucker for authority, but she's way more cunning, and knows how to navigate gray areas.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_421%	Hey!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_422%	It was a compliment.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_424%	...Ok?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_426%	Dahlia, on the other hand, is truly a paragon of purity. She may be raw, but she won't break or compromise her ideals.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_427%	I see your point. It's going to be tough to dig up dirt on her should we aim to undermine her persona.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_428%	But no one's perfect. I'm sure some of her ideals conflict with what the coven deems to be just or legal. We could exploit that, should we find it.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_432%	Mmm...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_433%	Alright, what about her weaknesses?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_435%	Do we really need to...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_436%	Yes.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_437%	Ah... ok. I don't really like to speak ill of my friends, but...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_439%	She's a bit of a... brute?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_440%	Definitely lacks finesse and some class. Things that I deem important for politics.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_441%	Mmm... we could use that, yeah.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_442%	What do you think, Fortuna?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_443%	What is Dahlia's most critical flaw?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_446%	She is very impulsive, impatient, and gets angry easily.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_447%	Dahlia's very green when it comes to debating politics or philosophy.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_448%	She's very radical. Lacks diplomacy.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_449%	She's the least... astute of the lot. Easy to trick.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_453%	She is very impulsive, impatient, and gets angry easily.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_454%	Good. If we can provoke her during a debate the coven is sure to question her ability to rule.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_455%	We should be on the lookout for opportunities to get her mad during the campaign.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_459%	Dahlia's very green when it comes to debating politics or philosophy.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_460%	Mmm... That's a very exploitable flaw.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_461%	We should aim to have as many exchanges with Dahlia as possible, and defeat her dialectically.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_462%	Send as many challenging questions as we can her way. Force her to make public statements on hairy topics.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_463%	She's likely to sabotage herself if we overwhelm her with complex dilemmas.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_467%	She's very radical. Lacks diplomacy.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_468%	That's perfect. That trait can be the ruin of a candidate.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_469%	We attack her pride, lead her on to appear even more radical in the eyes of the coven than she really is. Scare off her supporters.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_473%	She's the least... astute of the lot. Easy to trick.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_475%	Is that an invitation to play dirty?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_476%	Ah! Not really... I just... you asked for the weakest spot.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_478%	I don't feel comfortable with tricking Dahlia either...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_480%	We won't cross any lines you're not willing to cross, don't worry.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_481%	But should the situation get desperate, it's good to know we can trick her into some fine mess.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_482%	Maybe at the cost of your friendship but...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_483%	Oh, gods, I say we avoid that at all costs...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_485%	Ok, ok.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_489%	I kind of agree with Jasmine, here, though... Is this really necessary?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_490%	It's your call, but if we don't exploit our opponents' flaws it'll make it less likely for Jasmine to become the next leader.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_491%	Politics are ugly, I know.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_492%	But also, let me tell you, you should expect the same from your rival. Friends or not, I'm sure Dahlia won't be pulling any punches. Be ready.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_493%	Ah... I'm already regretting this.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_494%	But sure, whatever. I'll handle it.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_495%	Everything is gonna be alright, Fortuna.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_497%	After this is all over, I trust both the coven and our friendship will emerge stronger than ever.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_499%	There's a good attitude.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_502%	Shall we move onto Cupressa?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_503%	What? Who the hell is Cupressa?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_504%	Yeah, she's running for leader too.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_505%	I like her a lot. We've worked together on several occasions, but even though she's one of the founding members of our coven, she isn't very well known.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_506%	No one truly thinks she poses any threat to Dahlia or Jasmine, but she is a candidate nonetheless.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_507%	We should study her. I believe this dark horse has a chance of surprising us all.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_508%	Tell me who she is already, come on.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_510%	Cupressa, The Historian Witch.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_511%	The eldest Witch in our coven. She precedes even Aedana. Cupressa is originally from Earth, but ascended way before humanity started even writing.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_512%	She has an infallible memory. All events get registered inside her tree rings.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_517%	She's been a really valuable source for the Cosmic Gazette. Cupressa has helped us many times with our articles.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_520%	We've worked together many times at the coven's archives. It's a neverending enterprise to register all her knowledge on paper.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_522%	The thing is that she's always played a secondary role in the coven, just supporting us with her wisdom.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_523%	But, apparently, Cupressa isn't a fan of change and isn't happy with the direction Jasmine or Dahlia want to take the coven, so for the first time she's running for leader.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_530%	Her program is easy to sum up: She wants to keep things exactly as Aedana left them.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_532%	Moreover, she advocates for preserving Aedana's corpse as some sort of oracle, to keep using her as a channel to consult with the gods and to set the direction for the coven.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_533%	Wow. Fuck Cupressa.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_534%	Hey! Enough with the disrespect, please.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_535%	Fuck her program, in any case. I know Cupressa personally and she is very kind and helpful. But yes, no one wants the ghost of Aedana to keep ruling over us.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_536%	She has very few supporters, all among the eldest. But I wouldn't underestimate her.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_537%	Cupressa has this special, mystical aura around her. Combined with her vast knowledge she's sure to impress many voters during the campaign.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_538%	But what I'm more afraid of is that, depending on how gruesome the race gets, we could scare some of the most conservative witches into switching sides from Jasmine to Cupressa.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_540%	I see...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_541%	Yeah, I was counting on the support of the elders, and knowing that Dahlia will probably be pretty popular among the youngest Witches...
%politics_analysis_jasmine_542%	I'm not really worried about Cupressa winning this race per se.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_543%	But she may end up siphoning too many votes from us, making Dahlia end up with the higher count.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_544%	As long as we don't underestimate Cupressa and keep her in check it all should be alright, I think.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_545%	Understood.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_546%	Alright, I think we're ready to get into Jamine's program now.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_547%	Do you want to take five?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_548%	I'm fine!
%politics_analysis_jasmine_549%	And you? Do you want to take a break or do you want to jump into it?
%politics_analysis_jasmine_552%	Let's take a break.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_553%	Nah, let's get this over with already.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_557%	Let's take a break.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_558%	Alright, I'll stay here reviewing our options.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_559%	Let me know when you're ready to move on.
%politics_analysis_jasmine_564%	Nah, let's get this over with already.
%politics_analysis_solo_2%	How are you?
%politics_analysis_solo_5%	Fine. Relaxed.
%politics_analysis_solo_6%	Ready. Focused.
%politics_analysis_solo_7%	Excited. Eager to start.
%politics_analysis_solo_8%	Awful. Anxious.
%politics_analysis_solo_9%	Terrified.
%politics_analysis_solo_13%	Fine. Relaxed.
%politics_analysis_solo_16%	Ready. Focused.
%politics_analysis_solo_19%	Excited. Eager to start.
%politics_analysis_solo_22%	Awful. Anxious.
%politics_analysis_solo_25%	Terrified.
%politics_analysis_solo_27%	Good.
%politics_analysis_solo_28%	Hold on to that fuel.
%politics_analysis_solo_29%	Did you meet with Dahlia and Jasmine?
%politics_analysis_solo_31%	No.
%politics_analysis_solo_32%	How come?
%politics_analysis_solo_33%	I wanted to catch them off balance.
%politics_analysis_solo_34%	Whoa, I didn't think you had it in you.
%politics_analysis_solo_35%	But that's good news for the race, I guess.
%politics_analysis_solo_38%	Yes, I did.
%politics_analysis_solo_39%	How did they take it?
%politics_analysis_solo_42%	I believe we're fine. All's good.
%politics_analysis_solo_43%	They didn't show it, but I know they weren't happy.
%politics_analysis_solo_47%	I believe we're fine. All's good.
%politics_analysis_solo_48%	Really?
%politics_analysis_solo_49%	We promised we'll always be friends, no matter what.
%politics_analysis_solo_50%	Ugh, so corny. This is going to be the weirdest political race in the universe.
%politics_analysis_solo_51%	Hahaha. Maybe all political conflicts should be handled with as much love as this one.
%politics_analysis_solo_52%	Well, jury's still out on how well this is going to go.
%politics_analysis_solo_53%	They're good friends.
%politics_analysis_solo_54%	I'm sure this will all be handled honorably.
%politics_analysis_solo_55%	There's no honor in politics. Only victory.
%politics_analysis_solo_56%	Whatever. What now?
%politics_analysis_solo_60%	They didn't show it, but I know they weren't happy.
%politics_analysis_solo_61%	It's only natural.
%politics_analysis_solo_62%	They both wanted you on their side because they know how fundamental your talents are for this campaign.
%politics_analysis_solo_63%	I'm sure they're terrified now they know you're running against them.
%politics_analysis_solo_64%	Ah, I don't know. They're way more prepared than me.
%politics_analysis_solo_65%	They're just bothered about the nuisance.
%politics_analysis_solo_66%	You can't really be that naive.
%politics_analysis_solo_67%	If we play our cards right, we're gonna sweep the polls.
%politics_analysis_solo_68%	Ah... maybe.
%politics_analysis_solo_72%	Ok. Allow me to give you a rundown of what's ahead.
%politics_analysis_solo_73%	We have to define a program and a plan.
%politics_analysis_solo_74%	First, we'll analyze our opponents and I'll interview you to see where we stand on the main issues.
%politics_analysis_solo_75%	Then we'll sketch and review a program.
%politics_analysis_solo_76%	Once we get to something solid, we'll form a team and schedule some campaign actions to get the ball rolling.
%politics_analysis_solo_77%	The date for the election congress hasn't been decided yet, but we're against the clock as of now.
%politics_analysis_solo_78%	All clear?
%politics_analysis_solo_79%	Yes.
%politics_analysis_solo_80%	Good.
%politics_analysis_solo_81%	First of all, did someone tell you about the five pillars of the coven?
%politics_analysis_solo_82%	You know: Judgment, Law Enforcement, Forbidden Arts, Mortal Affairs, and Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_solo_87%	Do you need me to explain them to you?
%politics_analysis_solo_90%	I know about them. You can skip the explanation.
%politics_analysis_solo_91%	I heard about them. But explain it to me again, please.
%politics_analysis_solo_95%	I know about them. You can skip the explanation.
%politics_analysis_solo_99%	I don't know what you're talking about.
%politics_analysis_solo_100%	Really?
%politics_analysis_solo_101%	Yes, I'm sorry...
%politics_analysis_solo_102%	Ah... ok. Here we go.
%politics_analysis_solo_105%	I heard about them. But explain it to me again, please.
%politics_analysis_solo_106%	Thorough, that's good.
%politics_analysis_solo_107%	Here's the deal:
%politics_analysis_solo_109%	There are five key directives that keep our coven's cogs churning.
%politics_analysis_solo_111%	As I said: Judgment, Law Enforcement, Forbidden Arts, Mortal Affairs, and Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_solo_112%	Make good note of them.
%politics_analysis_solo_113%	Judgment is about how we deal with conflicts within the coven, how we determine who's at fault and such.
%politics_analysis_solo_114%	It's also the executive branch: Where the coven is going and how we deal with major events.
%politics_analysis_solo_116%	Until now we've had Runic Judgment. Which basically consisted of Aedana consulting with the gods, and us blindly swallowing whatever she fed us.
%politics_analysis_solo_117%	Then we have Law Enforcement.
%politics_analysis_solo_119%	That's how the coven punishes anyone who did something wrong or forbidden, as determined by Judgment.
%politics_analysis_solo_120%	Right now, as you're well aware, we send infractors into exile for a variable amount of time depending on the severity of their actions.
%politics_analysis_solo_121%	Can our slogan be "Fuck you, exile"?
%politics_analysis_solo_123%	Very punk, it may work, haha.
%politics_analysis_solo_125%	Next is Forbidden Arts.
%politics_analysis_solo_126%	That's how we deal with perilous magic and knowledge, such as summoning Behemoths, necromancy, etc.
%politics_analysis_solo_128%	The current directive is that when the coven determines that something could put our community at risk, we ban it.
%politics_analysis_solo_129%	Then there's Mortal Affairs.
%politics_analysis_solo_130%	That's how we deal with humans and... as traditionally put, other "lesser beings."
%politics_analysis_solo_131%	Lesser beings as in animals, or any lifeform that doesn't have access to magic, actually. Fuck that term, by the way.
%politics_analysis_solo_133%	Aedana determined that mortals should be exploited and manipulated at Witches' convenience.
%politics_analysis_solo_134%	Did you know that Aedana wanted to cause World War III on Earth?
%politics_analysis_solo_135%	What!? Why?
%politics_analysis_solo_136%	To harvest energy from mortals.
%politics_analysis_solo_138%	Fucking bastard. We still have a celebration pending to send her off to hell.
%politics_analysis_solo_139%	Hahaha, you bet.
%politics_analysis_solo_141%	Last but not least, there are the Witch Duties.
%politics_analysis_solo_142%	That defines what obligations members have to the coven.
%politics_analysis_solo_144%	Right now we have those obnoxious quarterly controls Aedana imposed on us to check on our progress.
%politics_analysis_solo_145%	You skipped them thanks to exile, but damn if they haven't been a pain in the ass...
%politics_analysis_solo_146%	Also, should a Witch fail to deliver, they'll eventually lose their membership. Imagine the strain that's put on many of our sisters.
%politics_analysis_solo_147%	I would have gladly done my homework in exchange for freedom, though.
%politics_analysis_solo_148%	I know, but still...
%politics_analysis_solo_149%	Luckily the controls are suspended until after the elections, and many of us are hoping they will be canceled forever.
%politics_analysis_solo_150%	Nice.
%politics_analysis_solo_151%	That's all five of them, right?
%politics_analysis_solo_152%	Yes.
%politics_analysis_solo_153%	But for these elections there's an additional, critical point to the race:
%politics_analysis_solo_154%	What to do with Aedana's corpse.
%politics_analysis_solo_155%	Oh, right.
%politics_analysis_solo_156%	The coven is divided between devouring her, making the hundred members that we are right now more powerful.
%politics_analysis_solo_157%	Or scattering her remains throughout the cosmos so more Witches can ascend, making the coven more diverse.
%politics_analysis_solo_158%	What's your stance on that?
%politics_analysis_solo_159%	I don't have a strong opinion on it. I'm fine with either becoming more powerful or welcoming more Witches.
%politics_analysis_solo_160%	But make no mistake, it's one of the hottest topics in these elections, so whatever you choose, be ready for a storm.
%politics_analysis_solo_161%	Understood.
%politics_analysis_solo_162%	Internalize these issues, take your time. Let me know when you're ready to continue.
%politics_analysis_solo_163%	Done?
%politics_analysis_solo_165%	Done.
%politics_analysis_solo_167%	Good. Let's start dissecting our rivals then.
%politics_analysis_solo_168%	Who do you want to start with?
%politics_analysis_solo_171%	Dahlia.
%politics_analysis_solo_172%	Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_solo_173%	You choose.
%politics_analysis_solo_177%	You choose.
%politics_analysis_solo_178%	Alright. Dahlia, then.
%politics_analysis_solo_181%	Dahlia.
%politics_analysis_solo_182%	Understood.
%politics_analysis_solo_186%	Dahlia's not from Earth. On our home planet, politics have evolved and twisted more than anywhere else in the explored universe.
%politics_analysis_solo_187%	She comes from the Daemonic Desertlands, where matriarchy-based warlordism and chieftainship are the primary form of organization, even nowadays.
%politics_analysis_solo_188%	I'm not saying to underestimate her, but we can expect her to not be well prepared to navigate the intricacies of a political campaign.
%politics_analysis_solo_189%	On the other hand, Dahlia's politics seem to be very different from her homeworld's.
%politics_analysis_solo_190%	From what I've gathered, her focus seems to be collectivizing the coven's duties and responsibilities. Distributing the coven's power horizontally.
%politics_analysis_solo_191%	"Level the playing field" is practically her slogan.
%politics_analysis_solo_195%	Whoa, how did you manage to get all that info in so little time?
%politics_analysis_solo_201%	I'm an archivist and all this is public domain. No sweat.
%politics_analysis_solo_204%	Please, I'm a detective, sis. This was barely scratching the surface.
%politics_analysis_solo_207%	Enjoying the perks of having a journalist sister now, huh?
%politics_analysis_solo_209%	Now focus.
%politics_analysis_solo_213%	Her program to achieve this is:
%politics_analysis_solo_215%	Judgment by referendum.
%politics_analysis_solo_216%	Dahlia argues that in a community this compact we should have to account for every member's input, regardless of their background or preparation.
%politics_analysis_solo_218%	Enforcement: None whatsoever. She believes in amicable resolution.
%politics_analysis_solo_219%	And should dialogue fail, she wants to leave the matter in the hands of the Arbitrage Office.
%politics_analysis_solo_220%	Her point being that we don't need to police ourselves when we already have the Magical Pact.
%politics_analysis_solo_222%	Forbidden Arts: Allow free access to any kind of magic, and control them through education, not banning.
%politics_analysis_solo_224%	Mortal Affairs: Cut all ties with mortals.
%politics_analysis_solo_225%	Dahlia believes we're too privileged to be messing with people's lives. She thinks we should leave them be and focus on the cosmic and the magical.
%politics_analysis_solo_227%	Witch Duties: Magical tax.
%politics_analysis_solo_228%	Have every member of the coven share a percentage of their magic output to pool resources for the benefit of the clan.
%politics_analysis_solo_230%	And finally, she believes we should scatter Aedana's remains, so more Witches can ascend and our coven can become more diverse.
%politics_analysis_solo_231%	As you can see, Dahlia is betting on a kindhearted community that requires good will to work. Almost utopic, I must say.
%politics_analysis_solo_234%	What do you think is the best strategy to undermine her program?
%politics_analysis_solo_237%	I don't want to undermine it, it's pretty cool.
%politics_analysis_solo_238%	Expose her naiveté. Faith in good intentions is ridiculous.
%politics_analysis_solo_239%	Horizontalism will make us slow and clumsy.
%politics_analysis_solo_240%	Point out the failure of communism on Earth.
%politics_analysis_solo_241%	Spotlight the primitive societies of her homeworld.
%politics_analysis_solo_246%	I don't want to undermine it, it's pretty cool.
%politics_analysis_solo_248%	That won't float. It's imperative you challenge your opponent's ideals to get ahead.
%politics_analysis_solo_249%	Try again.
%politics_analysis_solo_253%	Again!?
%politics_analysis_solo_254%	You're just messing with me now, right?
%politics_analysis_solo_255%	Hahaha... yeah, sorry.
%politics_analysis_solo_259%	Expose her naiveté. Faith in good will is ridiculous.
%politics_analysis_solo_260%	Good one. The ideal community she wants to paint a picture of isn't a reality.
%politics_analysis_solo_261%	We'll focus on conveying that to the rest of the coven.
%politics_analysis_solo_265%	Horizontalism will make us slow and clumsy.
%politics_analysis_solo_266%	A bit of an authoritarian stance, maybe, but if we offer a powerful alternative it'll work.
%politics_analysis_solo_267%	We'll need to come up with a power structure smart enough to overcome the illusion of horizontalism.
%politics_analysis_solo_271%	Point out the failure of communism on Earth.
%politics_analysis_solo_272%	Mmm... it may work. However, although the majority of Witches from our coven come from Earth, many of them predate the existence of communism.
%politics_analysis_solo_273%	Don't worry, we'll figure out a more universal approach.
%politics_analysis_solo_277%	Spotlight the primitive societies of her homeworld.
%politics_analysis_solo_278%	Ugh... Even if it's effective, that will paint you as an elitist bitch. We need you to be more agreeable to gather support.
%politics_analysis_solo_279%	Maybe there's a way to iron out that train of thought without compromising your image. I'll think about it.
%politics_analysis_solo_283%	Ok, now. Let's capitalize on your intimate knowledge about your rival.
%politics_analysis_solo_284%	What would you say is Dahlia's strongest point?
%politics_analysis_solo_287%	Her overwhelming charisma and the confidence she projects.
%politics_analysis_solo_288%	She embodies the winds of change.
%politics_analysis_solo_289%	Dahlia is pretty popular among young Witches.
%politics_analysis_solo_290%	Her determination. She is battle ready.
%politics_analysis_solo_291%	She is the most virtuous, the most incorruptible of us all.
%politics_analysis_solo_295%	Her overwhelming charisma and the confidence she projects.
%politics_analysis_solo_296%	Mmm... yeah, if this were a popularity contest she'd have the upper hand.
%politics_analysis_solo_297%	I'm sure her campaign will kick off with a lot of momentum.
%politics_analysis_solo_298%	We can't hope to defeat her on any revolutionary grounds.
%politics_analysis_solo_299%	We'll have to play on your intelligence and mysticism to get a bite of her cake.
%politics_analysis_solo_303%	She embodies the winds of change.
%politics_analysis_solo_304%	Anyone fed up with Aedana's abuse is likely to support Dahlia.
%politics_analysis_solo_305%	Mmm... good point.
%politics_analysis_solo_306%	And I don't think it'll pay to be even more radical than her.
%politics_analysis_solo_307%	Maybe our best bet will be to offer change but with less risk, some middle ground between Jasmine and Dahlia.
%politics_analysis_solo_308%	If we do it well it'll paint us as the smartest choice.
%politics_analysis_solo_312%	Dahlia is pretty popular among young Witches.
%politics_analysis_solo_313%	Mmm... I was thinking more about what her strongest attributes are as an individual.
%politics_analysis_solo_314%	But you're right, that may be Dahlia's strongest weapon in this campaign.
%politics_analysis_solo_315%	Young Witches account for at least a quarter of the coven's members.
%politics_analysis_solo_316%	We'll have to decide carefully whether to spend time trying to sweep votes from the novices or whether to directly focus our efforts on other demographics.
%politics_analysis_solo_317%	We'll see. Depending on our program it'll be a tough sell.
%politics_analysis_solo_321%	Her determination. She is battle ready.
%politics_analysis_solo_322%	Indeed. Dahlia is going to be the hardest to throw off her game.
%politics_analysis_solo_323%	Impossible to intimidate or overwhelm. She's likely to force us to be on defense rather than offense when dealing with her.
%politics_analysis_solo_324%	We can't expect to beat her on those grounds, but we need to at least aim to match her determination to get a bite of her cake.
%politics_analysis_solo_325%	It promises to be tough, but I believe in you.
%politics_analysis_solo_329%	She is the most virtuous, the most incorruptible of us all.
%politics_analysis_solo_330%	Mmm... I'd say that feels more like Jasmine, don't you think?
%politics_analysis_solo_331%	Well, Jasmine is a sucker for authority, but she's way more cunning, and knows how to navigate gray areas.
%politics_analysis_solo_332%	Dahlia, on the other hand, is truly a paragon of purity. She may be raw, but she won't break or compromise her ideals.
%politics_analysis_solo_333%	I see your point. It's going to be tough to dig up dirt on her should we aim to undermine her persona.
%politics_analysis_solo_334%	But no one's perfect. I'm sure some of her ideals conflict with what the coven deems to be right or legal. We could exploit that should we find it.
%politics_analysis_solo_338%	Alright, what about her weaknesses? What is Dahlia's most critical flaw?
%politics_analysis_solo_341%	She is very impulsive, impatient, and gets angry easily.
%politics_analysis_solo_342%	Dahlia's very green when it comes to debating politics or philosophy.
%politics_analysis_solo_343%	She's very radical. Lacks diplomacy.
%politics_analysis_solo_344%	She's the least... astute of the lot. Easy to trick.
%politics_analysis_solo_345%	Making daggers is the least valuable asset offered by a candidate.
%politics_analysis_solo_349%	She is very impulsive, impatient, and gets angry easily.
%politics_analysis_solo_350%	Good. If we can provoke her during a debate the coven is sure to question her ability to rule.
%politics_analysis_solo_351%	We should be on the lookout for opportunities to get her mad during the campaign.
%politics_analysis_solo_355%	Dahlia's very green when it comes to debating politics or philosophy.
%politics_analysis_solo_356%	Mmm... That's a very exploitable flaw.
%politics_analysis_solo_357%	We should aim to have as many exchanges with Dahlia as possible, and defeat her dialectically.
%politics_analysis_solo_358%	Send as many challenging questions as we can her way. Force her to make public statements on hairy topics.
%politics_analysis_solo_359%	She's likely to sabotage herself if we overwhelm her with complex dilemmas.
%politics_analysis_solo_363%	She's very radical. Lacks diplomacy.
%politics_analysis_solo_364%	That's perfect. That trait can be the ruin of a candidate.
%politics_analysis_solo_365%	We attack her pride, lead her on to appear even more radical than she is in front of the eyes of the coven. Scare off her supporters.
%politics_analysis_solo_369%	She's the least... astute of the lot. Easy to trick.
%politics_analysis_solo_371%	Is that an invitation to play dirty?
%politics_analysis_solo_372%	Ah! Not really... I just... you asked for the weakest spot.
%politics_analysis_solo_374%	We won't cross any lines you're not willing to cross, don't worry.
%politics_analysis_solo_375%	But should the situation get desperate, it's good to know we can trick her into some fine mess.
%politics_analysis_solo_376%	Maybe at the cost of your friendship but...
%politics_analysis_solo_380%	Making daggers is the least valuable asset offered by a candidate.
%politics_analysis_solo_381%	Mmm.. a bit out of the box as an answer, but we can work with that.
%politics_analysis_solo_382%	In the picture she's painting for the coven there's no need for an especially powerful leader.
%politics_analysis_solo_383%	But with a few scare tactics we can create the need in the voters for a leader that holds a critical talent...
%politics_analysis_solo_385%	And your divination is the winning horse for that kind of race.
%politics_analysis_solo_390%	Ah... Is this really necessary?
%politics_analysis_solo_391%	It's your call, but if we don't exploit your opponents' flaws it'll make it less likely for you to become the next leader.
%politics_analysis_solo_392%	Politics are ugly, I know.
%politics_analysis_solo_393%	But also, let me tell you, you should expect the same from your rivals. Friends or not, I'm sure they won't be pulling any punches. Be ready.
%politics_analysis_solo_394%	Ah... I'm already regretting this.
%politics_analysis_solo_395%	But sure, whatever. I'll handle it.
%politics_analysis_solo_397%	Shall we go over Jasmine now?
%politics_analysis_solo_398%	Yeah, sure.
%politics_analysis_solo_402%	Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_solo_403%	Understood.
%politics_analysis_solo_407%	Jasmine was born in a small English town during the Industrial Revolution, circa 1800.
%politics_analysis_solo_408%	That put her in a cultural sweet spot for amassing the sympathies of the coven.
%politics_analysis_solo_409%	She's a young Witch in the eyes of the eldest, medieval and ancient Witches, but not so alien as us contemporanean Witches with our world wars, TV, internet, and other global "lunacies."
%politics_analysis_solo_410%	Jasmine gets along with us, but is also part of the "last decent generation," according to the most conservative Witches.
%politics_analysis_solo_411%	Her politics are a liberal revision of Aedana's, removing the most tyrannical mechanisms by reducing punishment and responsibilities.
%politics_analysis_solo_412%	That will maintain the status quo, but give more room for individualism and personal enterprise, free from so many duties and the fear of failure.
%politics_analysis_solo_416%	Whoa, how did you manage to get all that info in so little time?
%politics_analysis_solo_422%	I'm an archivist and all this is public domain. No sweat.
%politics_analysis_solo_425%	Please, I'm a detective, sis. This was barely scratching the surface.
%politics_analysis_solo_428%	Enjoying the perks of having a journalist sister now, huh?
%politics_analysis_solo_430%	Now focus.
%politics_analysis_solo_434%	Her program to achieve this is:
%politics_analysis_solo_436%	Judgment will be performed by a quorum of the four eldest witches, in agreement with the leader.
%politics_analysis_solo_437%	That is the sweetest candy of her program for the old lot.
%politics_analysis_solo_439%	Enforcement will work with a system of strikes. She hasn't specified how many yet, but should a Witch accumulate enough warnings she will be expelled from the coven.
%politics_analysis_solo_440%	Way less radical than exile and the worst case scenario is the freedom to start anew elsewhere.
%politics_analysis_solo_442%	Regarding Forbidden Arts, she won't change a thing. Anything deemed dangerous by the eldest Witches will be banned.
%politics_analysis_solo_444%	Then, for Mortal Affairs, Jasmine proposes a model of protection and guidance.
%politics_analysis_solo_445%	What is good for humanity? What should we protect them from? I guess that'll be determined by the quorum of the eldest.
%politics_analysis_solo_447%	Lastly, as for Witch Duties, she proposes a policy of no vigilance.
%politics_analysis_solo_448%	Jasmine argues that we should trust every sister will have the coven's interests in mind and that there's no need to evaluate or impose any duties on any member.
%politics_analysis_solo_450%	And, of course, regarding the trending topic, Jasmine wants the coven to devour Aedana's corpse so we all become more powerful.
%politics_analysis_solo_451%	Take a minute to interiorize Jasmine's program.
%politics_analysis_solo_452%	Sure.
%politics_analysis_solo_453%	Done?
%politics_analysis_solo_455%	Done.
%politics_analysis_solo_456%	Perfect. So tell me now...
%politics_analysis_solo_459%	What do you think is the best strategy to undermine her program?
%politics_analysis_solo_462%	I don't want to undermine it, it's pretty cool.
%politics_analysis_solo_463%	These lax policies will incentivize foul play.
%politics_analysis_solo_464%	These plans benefit the powerful and forsake novices.
%politics_analysis_solo_465%	Individualism will fracture the community.
%politics_analysis_solo_466%	Tradition and coven culture will vanish in this setup.
%politics_analysis_solo_471%	I don't want to undermine it, it's pretty cool.
%politics_analysis_solo_473%	That won't float. It's imperative you challenge your opponent's ideals to get ahead.
%politics_analysis_solo_474%	Try again.
%politics_analysis_solo_478%	Again!?
%politics_analysis_solo_479%	You're just messing with me now, right?
%politics_analysis_solo_480%	Hahaha... yeah, sorry.
%politics_analysis_solo_484%	These lax policies will incentivize foul play.
%politics_analysis_solo_485%	Good point. Lack of consequences and no vigilance at all may lead to terrible events.
%politics_analysis_solo_486%	We can scare both conservatives and young voters away from Jasmine with this line of thought.
%politics_analysis_solo_490%	These plans benefit the powerful and forsake novices.
%politics_analysis_solo_491%	Mmm... interesting. If we adopt this strategy we may polarize the coven's opinion...
%politics_analysis_solo_492%	But in the long run we could gather the support of the young and weak, plus the support of the most compassionate elders.
%politics_analysis_solo_493%	It may do the trick.
%politics_analysis_solo_497%	Individualism will fracture the community.
%politics_analysis_solo_498%	Absolutely. And a fractured sisterhood is a weak sisterhood, or no sisterhood at all, we could say.
%politics_analysis_solo_499%	That should weaken Jasmine's support and snatch many voters from her side, if we propose a sensible alternative.
%politics_analysis_solo_503%	Tradition and coven culture will vanish in this setup.
%politics_analysis_solo_504%	Oh, I wasn't expecting that kind of conservative approach.
%politics_analysis_solo_505%	But we can work with this. It will make a nice curve ball to gather support from traditionalists, attacking to the heart of Jasmine's target demographics.
%politics_analysis_solo_509%	Good. Good. Now to assess the candidate herself. Let's use your privileged info on Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_solo_510%	What would you say is Jasmine's strongest point?
%politics_analysis_solo_513%	She's extremely intelligent and manipulative.
%politics_analysis_solo_514%	She is a pillar of the community.
%politics_analysis_solo_515%	Her apparent innocence and frailty.
%politics_analysis_solo_516%	Her resourcefulness.
%politics_analysis_solo_517%	Her charming mother-like aura.
%politics_analysis_solo_521%	She's extremely intelligent and manipulative.
%politics_analysis_solo_522%	She knows how to read people and how to work them for her interests.
%politics_analysis_solo_523%	Whoa, strong declarations from a friend.
%politics_analysis_solo_524%	I mean, she's really kind and thoughtful. I don't even think she does it on purpose most of the time, it's just her nature.
%politics_analysis_solo_525%	But she has this way of talking you into things, you know.
%politics_analysis_solo_526%	I understand.
%politics_analysis_solo_527%	This is the hardest quality to battle against. If we can't overpower her dialectically, we'll need to fight her with strong action.
%politics_analysis_solo_531%	She is a pillar of the community.
%politics_analysis_solo_532%	She helps and provides for many people with her garden, and has many contacts and friends.
%politics_analysis_solo_533%	Mmm... that sure puts her ahead in the race from the very start.
%politics_analysis_solo_534%	It'll be hard to win people's trust in Jasmine over to our side.
%politics_analysis_solo_535%	We'll need to undermine her capabilities as a leader and reinforce her status as a community provider so she stays like that, rather than as a ruler.
%politics_analysis_solo_539%	Her apparent innocence and frailty.
%politics_analysis_solo_540%	"Apparent," huh? I see where you're going with this.
%politics_analysis_solo_541%	She has this quality that makes anyone want to protect and support her.
%politics_analysis_solo_542%	Yeah, I can see how she could become a saint-like figure. An innocent martyr that is devoted to her coven.
%politics_analysis_solo_543%	Nothing but good will for her sisters. Let's follow Saint Jasmine.
%politics_analysis_solo_544%	Haha, something like that, yeah.
%politics_analysis_solo_548%	Her resourcefulness.
%politics_analysis_solo_549%	She always manages to find a way out of any problem.
%politics_analysis_solo_550%	Plus her garden provides her with a great variety of tools to deal with just about any situation.
%politics_analysis_solo_551%	She has many contacts and smart ideas.
%politics_analysis_solo_552%	She's going to be hard to corner, I see.
%politics_analysis_solo_553%	But when it comes to resourcefulness, I believe you have the upper hand.
%politics_analysis_solo_554%	I mean, you got yourself a new deck while exiled. And what a deck.
%politics_analysis_solo_555%	Yeah, maybe... Took me a couple of centuries, though.
%politics_analysis_solo_556%	Whatever, let's focus on the present.
%politics_analysis_solo_560%	Her charming mother-like aura.
%politics_analysis_solo_561%	Mmm... right. A mother figure could well become the prom queen of this race.
%politics_analysis_solo_562%	Many voters decide based on instinct rather than analysis. And Jasmine's persona promises to be an excellent caretaker for the lot of us.
%politics_analysis_solo_563%	We'll need to expose her ugly sides to distort those motherly attributes.
%politics_analysis_solo_567%	Now to her flaws. What would you say is Jasmine's weakest point?
%politics_analysis_solo_570%	Her anxiety. She gets stressed easily.
%politics_analysis_solo_571%	Envy.
%politics_analysis_solo_572%	Her compassion.
%politics_analysis_solo_573%	She's easy to intimidate.
%politics_analysis_solo_574%	Vanity. She worries too much about appearances.
%politics_analysis_solo_578%	Her anxiety. She gets stressed easily.
%politics_analysis_solo_579%	Oooh, that's really easy to exploit. Good, good.
%politics_analysis_solo_580%	That's a flaw that will trigger almost automatically just by competing for leadership.
%politics_analysis_solo_581%	But we can push her buttons so she loses focus and messes up.
%politics_analysis_solo_585%	Envy.
%politics_analysis_solo_586%	Really?
%politics_analysis_solo_587%	Yes, and she does a poor job hiding it.
%politics_analysis_solo_588%	Mmm... We should come up with creative ways of triggering her envy, then. This will come very handy to cloud her judgment.
%politics_analysis_solo_592%	Her compassion.
%politics_analysis_solo_593%	That sounds more like a virtue, but you're right, compassion is something exploitable in its own way.
%politics_analysis_solo_594%	Taking pity on your rivals can be the ruin of a leader. We could also point out how some of her policies will cause suffering for some people.
%politics_analysis_solo_595%	We can throw her off her game by toying with her pity.
%politics_analysis_solo_599%	She's easy to intimidate.
%politics_analysis_solo_600%	Oof... that's one ugly road you're suggesting.
%politics_analysis_solo_601%	But should the situation get desperate for us we could try and scare her into place.
%politics_analysis_solo_602%	Nothing aggressive, of course. But there are many ways to produce threats and fears to throw her off her game.
%politics_analysis_solo_606%	Vanity. She worries too much about appearances.
%politics_analysis_solo_607%	Mmm... so if we manage to dig up some dirt on her we're sure to break her composure.
%politics_analysis_solo_608%	It'll be good to do some investigating and see if we can find something to throw her off her game.
%politics_analysis_solo_609%	Good to know.
%politics_analysis_solo_613%	Ah... I feel so bad doing this.
%politics_analysis_solo_614%	Toughen up, Fortuna. Her advisors will be doing the same about you, no doubt.
%politics_analysis_solo_615%	Plus, these are emergency resources. If we play our cards right we can hope for a clean victory.
%politics_analysis_solo_616%	Focus on bringing your best game and I won't have to push any ugly buttons.
%politics_analysis_solo_617%	Talk about pressure...
%politics_analysis_solo_619%	Shall we go over Dahlia now?
%politics_analysis_solo_620%	Yeah, sure.
%politics_analysis_solo_624%	Alright, now for the third candidate.
%politics_analysis_solo_625%	What!? There's more?
%politics_analysis_solo_626%	Of course, no one told you?
%politics_analysis_solo_627%	No? Who is it?
%politics_analysis_solo_628%	No one truly thinks she poses any threat to Dahlia or Jasmine, but she is a candidate nonetheless.
%politics_analysis_solo_629%	We should study her. I believe this dark horse has a chance of surprising us all.
%politics_analysis_solo_630%	Tell me who it is already, come on.
%politics_analysis_solo_632%	Cupressa, The Historian Witch.
%politics_analysis_solo_633%	The eldest Witch in our coven. She precedes even Aedana. Cupressa is originally from Earth, but ascended way before humanity started even writing.
%politics_analysis_solo_634%	She has an infallible memory. All events get registered inside her tree rings.
%politics_analysis_solo_639%	She's been a really valuable source for the Cosmic Gazette. Cupressa has helped us many times with our articles.
%politics_analysis_solo_642%	We've worked together many times at the coven's archives. It's a neverending enterprise to register all her knowledge on paper.
%politics_analysis_solo_644%	The thing is that she's always played a secondary role in the coven, just supporting us with her wisdom.
%politics_analysis_solo_645%	But, apparently, Cupressa isn't a fan of change and isn't happy with the direction Jasmine or Dahlia want to take the coven, so for the first time she's running for leader.
%politics_analysis_solo_652%	Her program is easy to sum up: She wants to keep things exactly as Aedana left them.
%politics_analysis_solo_654%	Moreover, she advocates for preserving Aedana's corpse as some sort of oracle, to keep using her as a channel to consult with the gods and to set the direction for the coven.
%politics_analysis_solo_655%	Wow. Fuck Cupressa.
%politics_analysis_solo_656%	Fuck her program, in any case. I know Cupressa personally and she is very kind and helpful.
%politics_analysis_solo_657%	But yes, no one wants the ghost of Aedana to keep ruling over us.
%politics_analysis_solo_658%	She has very few supporters, all among the eldest. But I wouldn't underestimate her.
%politics_analysis_solo_659%	Cupressa has this special, mystical aura around her. Combined with her vast knowledge, she's sure to impress many voters during the campaign.
%politics_analysis_solo_660%	Depending on how gruesome the race gets, we could scare some of the most conservative witches into switching sides from Jasmine to Cupressa.
%politics_analysis_solo_662%	I see...
%politics_analysis_solo_663%	As long as we don't underestimate Cupressa and keep her in check it all should be fine, though.
%politics_analysis_solo_664%	Understood.
%politics_analysis_solo_665%	Alright, are you ready to start defining our program? Do you want to take a break?
%politics_analysis_solo_668%	Let's take a break.
%politics_analysis_solo_669%	Nah, let's get this over with already.
%politics_analysis_solo_673%	Let's take a break.
%politics_analysis_solo_674%	Alright, I'll stay here reviewing our options.
%politics_analysis_solo_675%	Let me know when you're ready to move on.
%politics_analysis_solo_680%	Nah, let's get this over with already.
%politics_analysis_solo_681%	Alright.
%politics_poster_dahlia_2%	Here. What do you think?
%politics_poster_dahlia_7%	Mmm... very... neutral?
%politics_poster_dahlia_8%	Oh, you don't like it?
%politics_poster_dahlia_10%	No, no! It's pretty cool! I like it.
%politics_poster_dahlia_12%	I like it a lot, Fortuna! Thank you so much!
%politics_poster_dahlia_18%	It's pretty cool.
%politics_poster_dahlia_20%	Look at all those skulls!!!
%politics_poster_dahlia_21%	I love skulls!
%politics_poster_dahlia_27%	I like it!
%politics_poster_dahlia_28%	It's very... dynamic, with so much lightning, haha.
%politics_poster_dahlia_30%	Makes me look a bit like a superhero, doesn't it? Hahaha.
%politics_poster_dahlia_36%	A bit corny for my taste, with all those hearts.
%politics_poster_dahlia_37%	Yeaaah... I'm not a heart woman myself.
%politics_poster_dahlia_39%	But I can tell you put a lot of passion into it! Hahahaha.
%politics_poster_dahlia_45%	So many stars!! It's like the universe!!
%politics_poster_dahlia_47%	Pretty cool.
%politics_poster_dahlia_48%	You can never have too many stars on a political poster.
%politics_poster_dahlia_56%	Why is Dahlia's figure so tiny, though?
%politics_poster_dahlia_57%	Fortuna wanted to convey humility. I'm sure.
%politics_poster_dahlia_58%	Haha, maybe...
%politics_poster_dahlia_61%	It's bold that you decided to make Dahlia's figure that... big.
%politics_poster_dahlia_62%	Has a lot of presence.
%politics_poster_dahlia_64%	There's not enough poster for a Witch with as much presence as me! Hahaha.
%politics_poster_dahlia_65%	You like it?
%politics_poster_dahlia_67%	I love it! I wouldn't mind going even BIGGER!
%politics_poster_dahlia_68%	Haha, cool, cool.
%politics_poster_dahlia_75%	But... Why is she sideways?
%politics_poster_dahlia_76%	Am I missing some kind of underlying message here?
%politics_poster_dahlia_77%	Shhh. Don't question the talent. It's beautiful, as mysterious as it is.
%politics_poster_dahlia_81%	Why did you decide to have her figure upside down?
%politics_poster_dahlia_83%	Oh, I thought the whole poster was upside down, haha.
%politics_poster_dahlia_85%	It's fun! It conveys that I'm not your usual candidate.
%politics_poster_dahlia_86%	Well, as long as you like it.
%politics_poster_dahlia_90%	I don't know, I wanted to go for something original, haha.
%politics_poster_dahlia_92%	Should I give it another try?
%politics_poster_dahlia_94%	Are you kidding!? IT'S PERFECT!
%politics_poster_dahlia_96%	I wouldn't want it any other way. I'm going to keep one in my workshop forever.
%politics_poster_dahlia_97%	Haha, shut up.
%politics_poster_dahlia_99%	I'm so ready to win this.
%politics_poster_dahlia_100%	Finally. Honestly, I'm really not cut out for politics. It's too much work.
%politics_poster_dahlia_101%	I feel you. Anything for our sisters, though.
%politics_poster_dahlia_102%	Thank you so much for your help, Fortuna.
%politics_poster_dahlia_103%	You too, Patrice.
%politics_poster_dahlia_104%	I'll do my best to not disappoint you.
%politics_poster_dahlia_105%	Likewise.
%politics_poster_jasmine_2%	Here. What do you think?
%politics_poster_jasmine_7%	Mmm... very... neutral?
%politics_poster_jasmine_8%	Oh, you don't like it?
%politics_poster_jasmine_10%	No, no! It's pretty cool! I like it.
%politics_poster_jasmine_11%	I think it's an elegant, simple design.
%politics_poster_jasmine_16%	It's pretty cool.
%politics_poster_jasmine_17%	Maybe you went a bit overboard with the skulls?
%politics_poster_jasmine_18%	I know we're Witches and all but that may be a bit baleful, haha.
%politics_poster_jasmine_23%	I like it!
%politics_poster_jasmine_24%	It's very... dynamic, with so much lightning, haha.
%politics_poster_jasmine_26%	Makes me look a bit like a superhero, doesn't it? Hahaha.
%politics_poster_jasmine_32%	A bit corny for my taste, with all those hearts.
%politics_poster_jasmine_34%	No, no, I love the hearts!! It's adorable!
%politics_poster_jasmine_40%	Pretty cool.
%politics_poster_jasmine_41%	You can never have too many stars on a political poster.
%politics_poster_jasmine_48%	Why is Jasmine's figure so tiny, though?
%politics_poster_jasmine_49%	I don't mind, it makes room for the original composition.
%politics_poster_jasmine_52%	It's bold that you decided to make Jasmine's figure that... big.
%politics_poster_jasmine_53%	Has a lot of presence.
%politics_poster_jasmine_55%	Yeah, haha, it's so embarrassing.
%politics_poster_jasmine_56%	I'm sorry...
%politics_poster_jasmine_58%	No, no! I mean in a good way. Like... it's so dramatic.
%politics_poster_jasmine_64%	But... Why is she sideways?
%politics_poster_jasmine_65%	Am I missing some kind of underlying message here?
%politics_poster_jasmine_66%	I like it, it makes you look at it longer.
%politics_poster_jasmine_70%	Why did you decide to have her figure upside down?
%politics_poster_jasmine_71%	It has some antichrist vibes.
%politics_poster_jasmine_73%	We're lucky this is for a coven, haha.
%politics_poster_jasmine_77%	I don't know, I wanted to go for something original, haha.
%politics_poster_jasmine_79%	Should I give it another try?
%politics_poster_jasmine_81%	No, no. It's good. I like it. It's powerful in a very unique way.
%politics_poster_jasmine_82%	We should send this to a museum once the race is over!
%politics_poster_jasmine_83%	Haha, shut up.
%politics_poster_jasmine_85%	We're ready to win this race now.
%politics_poster_jasmine_86%	Finally. Honestly, I'm really not cut out for politics. It's too much work.
%politics_poster_jasmine_87%	We'll make it fun, you'll see!
%politics_poster_jasmine_88%	Thank you so much for your help, Fortuna.
%politics_poster_jasmine_89%	You too, Patrice.
%politics_poster_jasmine_91%	I feel unstoppable now!
%politics_poster_jasmine_92%	I'll do my best to not disappoint you.
%politics_poster_jasmine_94%	You won't. I'm sure of that.
%politics_poster_solo_2%	What do you think?
%politics_poster_solo_7%	Mmm... very... neutral?
%politics_poster_solo_8%	Oh, you don't like it?
%politics_poster_solo_10%	No, no! It's pretty cool! I like it.
%politics_poster_solo_15%	It's pretty cool.
%politics_poster_solo_16%	You went a bit overboard with the skulls.
%politics_poster_solo_17%	I know we are Witches and all but that may be a bit baleful.
%politics_poster_solo_22%	I like it!
%politics_poster_solo_23%	It's very... dynamic, with so much lightning, haha.
%politics_poster_solo_27%	A bit corny for my taste, with all those hearts.
%politics_poster_solo_29%	But if that is how you feel, I'm all in.
%politics_poster_solo_34%	Pretty cool.
%politics_poster_solo_35%	You can never have too many stars on a political poster.
%politics_poster_solo_42%	Why is your figure so tiny, though?
%politics_poster_solo_43%	You ought to be more confident!
%politics_poster_solo_46%	It's bold that you decided to make your figure that... big.
%politics_poster_solo_47%	Has a lot of presence.
%politics_poster_solo_53%	But... Why are you sideways?
%politics_poster_solo_54%	Am I missing some kind of underlying message here?
%politics_poster_solo_57%	Why did you decide to have your figure upside down?
%politics_poster_solo_59%	It has some antichrist vibes. We're lucky this is for a coven, haha.
%politics_poster_solo_62%	I don't know, I wanted to go for something original, haha.
%politics_poster_solo_64%	Should I give it another try?
%politics_poster_solo_66%	No, no. It's good. I like it. It's powerful in a very unique way.
%politics_poster_solo_67%	If anything, it does a great job of capturing your essence.
%politics_poster_solo_68%	We should send this to a museum once the race is over.
%politics_poster_solo_69%	Haha, shut up.
%politics_poster_solo_71%	Great. We are ready to win this race.
%politics_poster_solo_72%	Finally. Honestly, I'm really not cut out for this.
%politics_poster_solo_73%	Yes you are. Fate provided you with a mean sister to make sure of it.
%politics_poster_solo_74%	Just my luck.
%politics_poster_solo_75%	Now... to the unavoidable question.
%politics_poster_solo_76%	Mmm?
%politics_poster_solo_77%	Why don't you draw a card to make sure we win this thing?
%politics_poster_solo_80%	What!? That would be cheating!
%politics_poster_solo_81%	Why did we put in this much work then?
%politics_poster_solo_82%	Yeah, it's been on my mind this whole time.
%politics_poster_solo_86%	What!? That would be cheating!
%politics_poster_solo_87%	Is it, really? I'm sure the others are going to be using all of their skills to get ahead.
%politics_poster_solo_88%	You just happen to be overpowered, but that's life.
%politics_poster_solo_89%	Hmm... I don't know...
%politics_poster_solo_93%	Why did we put in this much work then?
%politics_poster_solo_94%	For consistency.
%politics_poster_solo_95%	What does it matter if you become the next leader if you don't have a plan?
%politics_poster_solo_96%	You will have to actually run the coven, even if we get there through magical means.
%politics_poster_solo_97%	Right...
%politics_poster_solo_101%	Yeah, it's been on my mind this whole time.
%politics_poster_solo_102%	I believe you should do it.
%politics_poster_solo_103%	I'm sure the others will be using their own arts to get ahead of the race.
%politics_poster_solo_105%	It doesn't come without its risks, though.
%politics_poster_solo_106%	There's always a chance I draw a card that doesn't offer any favorable results to us.
%politics_poster_solo_107%	And once drawn there's not going back. We could assure our victory... But we could also doom us and make all of our efforts futile.
%politics_poster_solo_108%	Mmm... right.
%politics_poster_solo_109%	Well, you know your deck better than anyone.
%politics_poster_solo_110%	Our chances of winning through sheer effort are pretty decent, I'd say.
%politics_poster_solo_111%	But if you want to remove the anxiety from the competition by determining the outcome... I'm in.
%politics_poster_solo_114%	All right, game on. Let's draw a card.
%politics_poster_solo_115%	It's too risky. Let's just do our best.
%politics_poster_solo_119%	All right, game on. Let's draw a card.
%politics_poster_solo_121%	Yes!
%politics_poster_solo_122%	I can't get enough of your divination.
%politics_poster_solo_123%	It's always so thrilling.
%politics_poster_solo_124%	Let's hope this thrill pays off.
%politics_poster_solo_130%	It's too risky. Let's just do our best.
%politics_poster_solo_131%	Alright, alright.
%politics_poster_solo_132%	We should at least look for opportunities during the race to use the deck on our rivals.
%politics_poster_solo_133%	They'll have to agree to ask something of the deck, though.
%politics_poster_solo_134%	I don't do divination without consent. That's where I draw the line.
%politics_poster_solo_135%	Mmmph... ok, I'll try to come up with ways to... seduce them into getting readings.
%politics_poster_solo_136%	Suit yourself.
%politics_program_dahlia_3%	Ready to review the program?
%politics_program_dahlia_6%	Ah... give me some more time.
%politics_program_dahlia_7%	Yes, let's do this.
%politics_program_dahlia_11%	Ah... give me some more time.
%politics_program_dahlia_12%	Sure, take your time.
%politics_program_dahlia_16%	Yes, let's do this.
%politics_program_dahlia_19%	Alright. Go ahead, Dahlia.
%politics_program_dahlia_21%	Ok! Hear this!
%politics_program_dahlia_23%	Judgment by referendum.
%politics_program_dahlia_25%	Enforcement: None. Fuck that, I say we go for amicable resolution.
%politics_program_dahlia_27%	Forbidden Arts: None. Fuck prohibitions. Let's invest in educating our sisters so we're all aware of the risks and rewards.
%politics_program_dahlia_29%	Mortal Affairs: Fuck mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_30%	What?
%politics_program_dahlia_32%	Hahahahaha, sorry, I got carried away with the fuck thing.
%politics_program_dahlia_34%	I say we cut all ties with mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_35%	We are way too privileged to be messing with people's lives. Just leave them be and focus on the cosmic and the magical.
%politics_program_dahlia_36%	Gotcha.
%politics_program_dahlia_38%	Witch Duties: Magical tax. This is the true game changer.
%politics_program_dahlia_39%	Have every member of the coven share a percentage of their magic output to pool resources for the benefit of the clan.
%politics_program_dahlia_40%	That could be a pretty powerful asset for the coven, yeah.
%politics_program_dahlia_42%	And that's it! What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?
%politics_program_dahlia_43%	You forgot about the hottest topic: what to do with Aedana's corpse.
%politics_program_dahlia_46%	We scatter the shit out of that abomination of a leader, of course!
%politics_program_dahlia_47%	Witchhood is so precious! We should open the doors for more women to become Witches!
%politics_program_dahlia_48%	Gotcha.
%politics_program_dahlia_49%	So, honest feedback?
%politics_program_dahlia_51%	Of course, shoot.
%politics_program_dahlia_52%	You are betting on a kindhearted community that requires good will to work. Almost utopic, I must say.
%politics_program_dahlia_53%	Why aim for less?
%politics_program_dahlia_54%	I feel you, but our opponents are going to pick us apart.
%politics_program_dahlia_55%	Better to stay ahead and do our own self-analysis.
%politics_program_dahlia_56%	Gotcha.
%politics_program_dahlia_57%	Fortuna.
%politics_program_dahlia_59%	What would you say is the best strategy to counter Dahlia's stance?
%politics_program_dahlia_62%	Expose her naiveté. Faith in good intentions is ridiculous.
%politics_program_dahlia_63%	Horizontalism will make us slow and clumsy.
%politics_program_dahlia_64%	Point out the failure of communism on Earth.
%politics_program_dahlia_65%	Spotlight the primitive societies of her homeworld.
%politics_program_dahlia_69%	Expose her naiveté. Faith in good intentions is ridiculous.
%politics_program_dahlia_70%	Yeah, that's probably what our rivals will go for.
%politics_program_dahlia_71%	They'll most likely say that the ideal community Dahlia wants to paint a picture of isn't a reality.
%politics_program_dahlia_72%	Let them try. I know we can inspire everyone to wish for an ideal community.
%politics_program_dahlia_73%	I hope you're right.
%politics_program_dahlia_77%	Horizontalism will make us slow and clumsy.
%politics_program_dahlia_78%	A bit of an authoritarian stance, maybe, but it fits with the alternatives Cupressa and Jasmine may offer in their programs.
%politics_program_dahlia_79%	We should focus on conveying that a sisterhood needs to be horizontal to be fair.
%politics_program_dahlia_80%	Yeah, plus everyone likes the idea of not being bossed around. I think we can sell the appeal of our formula pretty well.
%politics_program_dahlia_84%	Point out the failure of communism on Earth.
%politics_program_dahlia_85%	What's that?
%politics_program_dahlia_86%	Oh, shit, mmm, where do I begin...
%politics_program_dahlia_87%	Don't bother. Even if the majority of Witches from our coven come from Earth, many of them predate the existence of communism.
%politics_program_dahlia_88%	Oh, right...
%politics_program_dahlia_89%	I don't think this is something we should worry about.
%politics_program_dahlia_93%	Spotlight the primitive societies of Dahlia's homeworld.
%politics_program_dahlia_95%	What!?
%politics_program_dahlia_96%	I mean, I'm just saying our opponents may go for it.
%politics_program_dahlia_97%	Are they seriously gonna stoop that low?
%politics_program_dahlia_98%	Ugh... Even if it's effective, it will paint them as elitist bitches.
%politics_program_dahlia_99%	Should they go there, it's really easy to counter. It could actually work in our favor, so don't worry, Dahlia.
%politics_program_dahlia_100%	...But still.
%politics_program_dahlia_101%	The most important part is that you don't let them get to you and throw you off your game.
%politics_program_dahlia_102%	...
%politics_program_dahlia_104%	I know. It won't happen.
%politics_program_dahlia_108%	Let's change gears. What about our strengths?
%politics_program_dahlia_110%	I'm definitely the strongest candidate!
%politics_program_dahlia_111%	Oh, yeah? In what sense?
%politics_program_dahlia_112%	In the literal one!
%politics_program_dahlia_114%	Hahahahaha.
%politics_program_dahlia_116%	...Ok? Good to know, should it all end in a battle royale.
%politics_program_dahlia_118%	In all seriousness, it's hard to think about one's own virtues...
%politics_program_dahlia_119%	I know. I know.
%politics_program_dahlia_121%	Fortuna, you know her well.
%politics_program_dahlia_122%	What would you say is Dahlia's strongest point?
%politics_program_dahlia_125%	Her overwhelming charisma and the confidence she projects.
%politics_program_dahlia_126%	She embodies the winds of change.
%politics_program_dahlia_127%	Dahlia is pretty popular among young Witches.
%politics_program_dahlia_128%	Her determination. She is battle ready.
%politics_program_dahlia_129%	She is the most virtuous, the most incorruptible of us all.
%politics_program_dahlia_133%	Her overwhelming charisma and the confidence she projects.
%politics_program_dahlia_134%	Mmm... yeah, if this were a popularity contest she'd have the upper hand.
%politics_program_dahlia_135%	I'm sure our campaign will kick off with a lot of momentum.
%politics_program_dahlia_136%	Our rivals can't hope to defeat us on any revolutionary grounds.
%politics_program_dahlia_137%	They'll have to overplay their intelligence and mysticism to get a bite of Dahlia's cake.
%politics_program_dahlia_141%	She embodies the winds of change.
%politics_program_dahlia_142%	Anyone fed up with Aedana's abuse is likely to support Dahlia.
%politics_program_dahlia_143%	Mmm... good point.
%politics_program_dahlia_144%	And I don't think anyone will try to be even more radical than her.
%politics_program_dahlia_145%	Our side is definitely the one of change and progress.
%politics_program_dahlia_146%	So our opponents are likely going to play with the coven's fears to scare some voters away from us.
%politics_program_dahlia_150%	Dahlia is pretty popular among young Witches.
%politics_program_dahlia_151%	Mmm... I was thinking more about what her strongest attributes are as an individual.
%politics_program_dahlia_152%	But you're right, that may be Dahlia's strongest weapon for this campaign.
%politics_program_dahlia_153%	Young Witches account for at least a quarter of the coven's members.
%politics_program_dahlia_154%	We'll have to carefully balance the time we spend catering to the novices and how much effort we put into other demographics.
%politics_program_dahlia_155%	A quarter of the coven won't be enough for a win, so... We'll see.
%politics_program_dahlia_159%	Her determination. She is battle ready.
%politics_program_dahlia_160%	Indeed. Dahlia is going to be the hardest to throw off her game.
%politics_program_dahlia_161%	Impossible to intimidate or overwhelm. She's likely to force our opponents to be on defense rather than offense when dealing with her.
%politics_program_dahlia_162%	We should try and schedule as many public debates as possible to make the most of this characteristic.
%politics_program_dahlia_166%	She is the most virtuous, the most incorruptible of us all.
%politics_program_dahlia_167%	Mmm... I'd say that feels more like Jasmine, don't you think?
%politics_program_dahlia_168%	Well, Jasmine is a sucker for authority, but she's way more cunning, and knows how to navigate gray areas.
%politics_program_dahlia_169%	Dahlia, on the other hand, is truly a paragon of purity. She won't break or compromise her ideals.
%politics_program_dahlia_171%	You can count on me.
%politics_program_dahlia_172%	I see... It's going to be tough for our opponents to dig up dirt on her should they aim to undermine her persona.
%politics_program_dahlia_173%	But nobody's perfect.
%politics_program_dahlia_175%	I'm sure some of her ideals conflict with what the coven deems to be right or legal. They will exploit that if they find an angle.
%politics_program_dahlia_179%	Anyway, what about her weaknesses? What is Dahlia's most critical flaw?
%politics_program_dahlia_182%	She is very impulsive, impatient, and gets angry easily.
%politics_program_dahlia_183%	Dahlia's very green when it comes to debating politics or philosophy.
%politics_program_dahlia_184%	She's very radical. Lacks diplomacy.
%politics_program_dahlia_185%	Making daggers is the least valuable asset offered by a candidate.
%politics_program_dahlia_189%	She is very impulsive, impatient, and gets angry easily.
%politics_program_dahlia_191%	WHAT!?
%politics_program_dahlia_193%	I'm kidding, I'm kidding, hahahaha.
%politics_program_dahlia_195%	They will likely try to provoke you during the debates. If you lose your cool, the coven is sure to question your ability to lead.
%politics_program_dahlia_196%	I know. I'll be strong.
%politics_program_dahlia_200%	Dahlia's very green debating when it comes to debating politics or philosophy.
%politics_program_dahlia_201%	Uh... that's true.
%politics_program_dahlia_202%	Mmm... That's a very exploitable flaw.
%politics_program_dahlia_203%	Let's hope their strategy doesn't involve trying to defeat you dialectically.
%politics_program_dahlia_204%	Although they will likely force you to make public statements on hairy topics.
%politics_program_dahlia_205%	I hope you don't sabotage yourself if they bring up complex dilemmas.
%politics_program_dahlia_206%	Mmm... Isn't "I don't know" a valid answer? I'm not embarrassed to acknowledge my shortcomings.
%politics_program_dahlia_207%	It's not ideal, but it'll be better than saying something outrageous.
%politics_program_dahlia_211%	She's very radical. Lacks diplomacy.
%politics_program_dahlia_212%	Ouch. That trait can be the ruin of a candidate.
%politics_program_dahlia_213%	They may attack her pride, provoke some outbursts to make her appear too extreme in the eyes of the coven, and scare off her supporters.
%politics_program_dahlia_214%	I'm very aware that they are going to try to play me.
%politics_program_dahlia_215%	What do you plan to do about it?
%politics_program_dahlia_216%	Not let them.
%politics_program_dahlia_217%	Uh... ok.
%politics_program_dahlia_221%	Making daggers is the least valuable asset offered by a candidate.
%politics_program_dahlia_222%	Wow. Really?
%politics_program_dahlia_223%	I'll keep that in mind the next time you need something forged.
%politics_program_dahlia_224%	Ah... I mean, I'm speaking from the perspective of the coven.
%politics_program_dahlia_225%	With Cupressa being a historian Witch, and how Jasmine's garden provides for half of the community's needs...
%politics_program_dahlia_226%	The thing is, in the picture Dahlia's painting for the coven there's no need for an especially powerful leader.
%politics_program_dahlia_227%	Not to say that you're not powerful.
%politics_program_dahlia_228%	It's alright, I understand what Fortuna's saying.
%politics_program_dahlia_230%	But that's the thing, we don't need an almighty ruler. I'm aiming to build an almighty community.
%politics_program_dahlia_232%	That's a good line, remember it for the race.
%politics_program_dahlia_238%	Alright! We're all up to speed with the plan and situation now.
%politics_program_dahlia_240%	Should we go out there and start kicking some political ass?
%politics_program_dahlia_241%	Well...
%politics_program_dahlia_242%	I say now we take a moment to reevaluate our program.
%politics_program_dahlia_244%	After this self-analysis, we might find some aspects we could adjust to increase our chances.
%politics_program_dahlia_252%	Mmm... Ok? What would you change?
%politics_program_dahlia_253%	And before you even start, I won't budge regarding the judgment system. Referendum is the way to go.
%politics_program_dahlia_254%	Also, I'm extremely proud of the magical tax.
%politics_program_dahlia_256%	Yeah, that's a very interesting one, asking for a percentage of the magical output of every member of the coven.
%politics_program_dahlia_257%	It'll open the door to attempt some ambitious projects. That much energy from so many Witches will be a tremendous asset to work with.
%politics_program_dahlia_259%	I'm super excited about forging a massive sword to slay cosmic horrors!
%politics_program_dahlia_260%	Provided the referendum approves of that, heh.
%politics_program_dahlia_262%	Hahahaha, of course.
%politics_program_dahlia_265%	Fortuna, based on what we've studied so far...
%politics_program_dahlia_267%	What do you think could improve from Dahlia's program?
%politics_program_dahlia_270%	Law Enforcement.
%politics_program_dahlia_271%	Forbidden Arts.
%politics_program_dahlia_272%	Mortal Affairs.
%politics_program_dahlia_273%	It's perfect like this.
%politics_program_dahlia_277%	It's perfect like this.
%politics_program_dahlia_282%	Ok. That's a substantial change.
%politics_program_dahlia_283%	You made a great point, yeah!
%politics_program_dahlia_284%	Do you want to change anything else?
%politics_program_dahlia_285%	Mmm...
%politics_program_dahlia_286%	Hey, hey, hold your horses.
%politics_program_dahlia_287%	That one change is fine, but don't go changing my whole plan, friends.
%politics_program_dahlia_290%	You heard the boss.
%politics_program_dahlia_293%	Are you happy with this change or do you want to focus on another point of the program?
%politics_program_dahlia_296%	I'm happy with this program.
%politics_program_dahlia_297%	Mmm... I'd like to reconsider.
%politics_program_dahlia_301%	I'm happy with this program.
%politics_program_dahlia_303%	That settles it, then!
%politics_program_dahlia_307%	Mmm... I'd like to reconsider.
%politics_program_dahlia_309%	Oh? What do you propose, then?
%politics_program_dahlia_313%	Law Enforcement.
%politics_program_dahlia_314%	OK. These are the current stances:
%politics_program_dahlia_315%	Jasmine wants to set up a system of warnings leading to expulsion.
%politics_program_dahlia_316%	Cupressa wants to keep exile as punishment.
%politics_program_dahlia_317%	And Dahlia advocates for amicable agreement.
%politics_program_dahlia_323%	What do you think would be the best system for Law Enforcement?
%politics_program_dahlia_326%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_dahlia_327%	(Ponder warnings leading to expulsion.)
%politics_program_dahlia_328%	Let's adopt the warnings and expulsion system.
%politics_program_dahlia_329%	(Ponder amicable resolution.)
%politics_program_dahlia_330%	Let's stick to amicable resolution.
%politics_program_dahlia_331%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_dahlia_332%	Let's go with community service.
%politics_program_dahlia_337%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_dahlia_338%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_dahlia_340%	FUCK EXILE!
%politics_program_dahlia_347%	Jasmine's solution of letting Witches accumulate strikes and, in the event they fail to behave, expelling them from the coven seems quite humane.
%politics_program_dahlia_348%	It's not a bad idea. It doesn't rob anyone of their freedom and the ultimate punishment is like... ultimate freedom, actually.
%politics_program_dahlia_349%	If you don't fit in here, just find a coven to match your philosophy or stay independent.
%politics_program_dahlia_350%	On the other hand, it's exploitable.
%politics_program_dahlia_351%	Witches will be able to cross the line several times without any consequences before they gather too many strikes.
%politics_program_dahlia_352%	And then they'll be trapped into behaving ideally or losing membership... Mmm...
%politics_program_dahlia_353%	In any case, it's not like they can just go and kill another Witch. The Magical Pact stands above our warning system.
%politics_program_dahlia_354%	The warnings allow for mischief, but I guess it's tolerable? Not all Witches are going to be ill-willed.
%politics_program_dahlia_355%	I believe in all of our sisters. But I wouldn't mind giving them warnings if they lose sight of what's good for us.
%politics_program_dahlia_356%	Mmm... I see...
%politics_program_dahlia_362%	Dahlia's idea about believing in amicable resolution may seem naive but... what is there to police, really, if we already have the Arbitrage Office?
%politics_program_dahlia_363%	Mmm... it's ideal, and quite beautiful to trust in our sisters' ability to coexist.
%politics_program_dahlia_364%	But the Arbitrage Office only really covers the Magical Pact.
%politics_program_dahlia_365%	Shouldn't we have a way to mediate more mundane conflicts within the coven?
%politics_program_dahlia_366%	The Arbitrage Office won't interfere in issues like who has rights over a newly discovered domain or who should be responsible for a common project gone wrong.
%politics_program_dahlia_367%	What do we do in those cases?
%politics_program_dahlia_368%	We leave that in the hands of a referendum.
%politics_program_dahlia_369%	If a situation becomes unresolvable we'll just consult with every sister. Some hundred witches should amount to good judgment, no?
%politics_program_dahlia_370%	Hah, yes, maybe.
%politics_program_dahlia_371%	Mmm...
%politics_program_dahlia_377%	Mmm... I have troubled feelings towards punishment as a method of enforcing the law.
%politics_program_dahlia_378%	I don't like the idea of keeping law and order through fear.
%politics_program_dahlia_379%	On the other hand, we can't expect everyone to behave... Isn't there a way to make punishment constructive?
%politics_program_dahlia_380%	Constructive how? Send bad witches to detention to do some magical studies?
%politics_program_dahlia_381%	Hahaha, not that, but hey... That may be an idea.
%politics_program_dahlia_382%	What about community service?
%politics_program_dahlia_383%	Elaborate.
%politics_program_dahlia_384%	Instead of expelling members or, gods forbid, send them to exile...
%politics_program_dahlia_385%	We could set up a system of assigning hours of community service depending on the severity of the infraction.
%politics_program_dahlia_386%	Tending other Witches' gardens, harvesting magic for the coven, helping the explorers... whatever is needed, really.
%politics_program_dahlia_387%	Mmm... That may not be a bad idea.
%politics_program_dahlia_388%	I don't know if it'll look childish or weak in the eyes of some Witches, but it'll benefit the community in the long run, that's for sure.
%politics_program_dahlia_389%	I'm not against it if you trust it'll improve our program!
%politics_program_dahlia_390%	Alright.
%politics_program_dahlia_394%	Let's adopt the warnings and expulsion system.
%politics_program_dahlia_400%	Let's stick to amicable resolution.
%politics_program_dahlia_401%	Ok, in that case...
%politics_program_dahlia_405%	Let's go with community service.
%politics_program_dahlia_411%	Forbidden Arts.
%politics_program_dahlia_412%	Very well.
%politics_program_dahlia_413%	These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_dahlia_414%	Cupressa wants to continue banning whatever she deems dangerous. Same as Jasmine.
%politics_program_dahlia_415%	Dahlia wants to give free access to any kind of magic, but to enforce education so we all know what we're dealing with.
%politics_program_dahlia_420%	How do you want to go about dealing with Forbidden Arts?
%politics_program_dahlia_423%	(Ponder banning.)
%politics_program_dahlia_424%	(Ponder free access and education.)
%politics_program_dahlia_425%	Let's stick to free access and education.
%politics_program_dahlia_426%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_dahlia_427%	Let's go with the permit system.
%politics_program_dahlia_432%	Mmm... So far the policy on banning dangerous arts has kept us safe.
%politics_program_dahlia_436%	Ahem... you sure?
%politics_program_dahlia_437%	What's that?
%politics_program_dahlia_438%	Ah, nothing. Go on.
%politics_program_dahlia_440%	It's not so much a matter of the dangers of these arts but of them falling into the wrong hands.
%politics_program_dahlia_441%	Powerful or dangerous arts could be a great asset for the coven... but opening the doors to use them may lead to some catastrophic consequences.
%politics_program_dahlia_442%	Yes, that's why we should properly educate our sisters on their risks.
%politics_program_dahlia_443%	Banning them will only entice curiosity and temptation.
%politics_program_dahlia_444%	Under no circumstances am I going to treat our sisters as if they were children that can't know better.
%politics_program_dahlia_445%	Ok. You're right. I understand.
%politics_program_dahlia_451%	It's a waste that our coven can't benefit from some of the most powerful arts, even if they're dangerous.
%politics_program_dahlia_452%	I'm not super sure about granting access instantly but we could open them up gradually as we educate our members on the implications and responsibilities of each spell.
%politics_program_dahlia_453%	That's my plan, yeah.
%politics_program_dahlia_454%	Ok, it's a bit scary but I guess it's cool.
%politics_program_dahlia_460%	There must be some middle ground between banning and free access.
%politics_program_dahlia_461%	Some summonings or spells can save lives. They could even protect us from major evils.
%politics_program_dahlia_462%	There's so much to achieve with the careful application of some of the Forbidden Arts, so...
%politics_program_dahlia_463%	What about extending permits?
%politics_program_dahlia_464%	Make it so a Witch can apply to have access to certain spells or rituals, and if the coven deems the applicant's purpose and aptitude appropriate, allow them to make use of them.
%politics_program_dahlia_465%	That is an interesting compromise. You know more about forbidden arts than I do, so I'll go with whatever you trust is better.
%politics_program_dahlia_466%	Mmm... It's not as free as I envisioned, but it definitely sounds like a sensible approach.
%politics_program_dahlia_467%	At the very least, it's going to be an easier sell during the race.
%politics_program_dahlia_468%	I'm not scared about being true to our intentions.
%politics_program_dahlia_469%	But you know more about this level of magic than me, Fortuna. I'll trust you if you think this is a better option.
%politics_program_dahlia_470%	Mmm...
%politics_program_dahlia_474%	Let's stick to free access and education.
%politics_program_dahlia_475%	Ok, in that case...
%politics_program_dahlia_479%	Let's go with the permit system.
%politics_program_dahlia_485%	Mortal Affairs.
%politics_program_dahlia_486%	Ok. These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_dahlia_487%	Cupressa wants to continue exploiting them for our benefit.
%politics_program_dahlia_488%	On the other hand, Jasmine says we should guide them, take care of them.
%politics_program_dahlia_489%	Dahlia proposes cutting all ties. She believes that we should not abuse our privilege over them and just leave them be.
%politics_program_dahlia_495%	How do you suggest we deal with Mortal Affairs?
%politics_program_dahlia_498%	(Ponder guidance.)
%politics_program_dahlia_499%	Let's switch to guiding mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_500%	(Ponder cutting all ties.)
%politics_program_dahlia_501%	Let's stick to cutting ties with mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_502%	(Ponder exploitation.)
%politics_program_dahlia_503%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_dahlia_504%	Let's go with revealing our existence to mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_510%	So far the coven has been exploiting mortals under Aedana's command.
%politics_program_dahlia_511%	Maybe it's time we repay the service mortal societies have been inadvertently offering us.
%politics_program_dahlia_512%	That's a good angle. Although taking care of them entails many responsibilities, as well as needing time and resources.
%politics_program_dahlia_513%	We'll be giving up some of our coven's momentum to charity.
%politics_program_dahlia_514%	Not that that's necessarily bad, but it's something to bear in mind if we choose this option.
%politics_program_dahlia_515%	I don't mind sharing resources to help people outside our coven. The magical tax could be a great resource for that purpose, in fact.
%politics_program_dahlia_516%	My point is that we shouldn't meddle with their lives.
%politics_program_dahlia_517%	Provided we don't manipulate mortals into becoming something we like instead of something they aspire to, I'm not against supporting them.
%politics_program_dahlia_518%	Mmm... I see...
%politics_program_dahlia_524%	To be honest, I don't care much about mortals or Earth or whatever other society in this universe.
%politics_program_dahlia_525%	And if you think about it, I believe most people would prefer to not have Witches meddling with their lives.
%politics_program_dahlia_526%	Right?
%politics_program_dahlia_527%	Yeah, maybe. On the other hand, we would forfeit many valuable resources. Mortals have been a great source of magic power and inspiration for our coven.
%politics_program_dahlia_528%	However, cutting ties will also cut all the shady practices and wrongdoings some Witches have been pushing on mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_529%	And, to some extent, it'll let us focus on our own affairs, instead of dealing with petty disputes over humans.
%politics_program_dahlia_530%	I say we cut all ties and leave them fucking be for once.
%politics_program_dahlia_531%	There's many things to enjoy and toy with in this cosmos besides mortal societies.
%politics_program_dahlia_532%	Mmm...
%politics_program_dahlia_538%	Should we continue exploiting mortals?
%politics_program_dahlia_539%	I mean, it's not like we were putting them through a grinder and exporting canned people.
%politics_program_dahlia_540%	They aren't aware of the exploitation to begin with. Some of them are even happier thanks to some spells our coven has cast on their communities.
%politics_program_dahlia_542%	What!? You're joking right now, right?
%politics_program_dahlia_543%	It's the most powerful position, to be honest.
%politics_program_dahlia_544%	Ideals are beautiful, but truth be told, our coven benefits a great deal from our current relationship with mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_545%	To keep exploiting them is objectively good for the coven, but morally dubious for many Witches. It could be a tough sell among some voters.
%politics_program_dahlia_546%	It doesn't matter, I don't care. This is not something up for debate.
%politics_program_dahlia_547%	We've gotta stop messing with them. Period.
%politics_program_dahlia_548%	I feel you. We were just entertaining every option.
%politics_program_dahlia_550%	Very well. I'd rather change subject, though.
%politics_program_dahlia_551%	Alright.
%politics_program_dahlia_557%	What else could we do about our relationship with mortals?
%politics_program_dahlia_558%	I don't know... if you want to propose an alternative for Dahlia's program it should be something drastically different.
%politics_program_dahlia_559%	The current stances cover every base so far.
%politics_program_dahlia_560%	What about this: We reveal the existence of Witches to mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_562%	Whoa! That's so radical!
%politics_program_dahlia_564%	Coming out strong. What's your angle?
%politics_program_dahlia_565%	Whatever decision we make regarding mortals will be morally gray, since they don't know about us.
%politics_program_dahlia_566%	What I propose here is a simple concept: Truth.
%politics_program_dahlia_568%	I'm loving this!
%politics_program_dahlia_569%	It'll definitely stir some chaos at the beginning, but in the end, wouldn't it be better if we develop a working relationship and make them aware of our capabilities?
%politics_program_dahlia_570%	Let them ask directly for what they need?
%politics_program_dahlia_572%	That is beautiful. But didn't you pay attention in school? Humanity has a troubling relationship with Witches. They burned us for sport.
%politics_program_dahlia_574%	Bah, that was only on Earth, right? Hahaha.
%politics_program_dahlia_576%	The cosmos is vast and full of mortal societies. Let earthlings deconstruct their misconceptions about Witchcraft.
%politics_program_dahlia_577%	Yup. And anyway, on Earth they burned poor innocent women. What can they really do about the real deal?
%politics_program_dahlia_578%	It'll be like revealing the existence of lions to a rabbit.
%politics_program_dahlia_579%	They can hide or reject us, but in no way will they be able to hurt us.
%politics_program_dahlia_581%	Heh, you're underestimating mortals' drive to destroy things. But sure, that could make our program look strong. We can spin a good angle from it.
%politics_program_dahlia_583%	Prepare to be attacked in any debates, though.
%politics_program_dahlia_584%	I have the utmost respect for mortals, I would never underestimate them. I don't care what the conservative lot have to say about this.
%politics_program_dahlia_585%	Revealing our existence is an honest approach. One I could be proud of.
%politics_program_dahlia_586%	I'm game if you think this can work.
%politics_program_dahlia_590%	Let's switch to guiding mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_596%	Let's stick to cutting all ties with mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_597%	Ok, in that case...
%politics_program_dahlia_601%	Let's go with revealing our existence to mortals.
%politics_program_dahlia_607%	Now... Take a minute to look at our program.
%politics_program_dahlia_608%	Internalize it, believe it, make it yours.
%politics_program_dahlia_609%	Dahlia, you're going to have to defend all these decisions in front of your rivals and the whole coven.
%politics_program_dahlia_610%	I'm ready for anything.
%politics_program_dahlia_611%	We're gonna need to sell the concept of it.
%politics_program_dahlia_612%	And for that...
%politics_program_dahlia_616%	We're going to need a slogan.
%politics_program_dahlia_619%	Ugh... I don't know, a slogan sounds cheap.
%politics_program_dahlia_620%	A slogan! Finally, something fun!
%politics_program_dahlia_624%	Ugh... I don't know, a slogan sounds cheap.
%politics_program_dahlia_625%	Come on, don't try to play it cool.
%politics_program_dahlia_626%	We need a slogan. It's not like other politicians use them for fun.
%politics_program_dahlia_627%	They really do work.
%politics_program_dahlia_628%	Ok, whatever...
%politics_program_dahlia_632%	A slogan! Finally, something fun!
%politics_program_dahlia_633%	It's been fun all the way for me so far, hehe.
%politics_program_dahlia_634%	You're really enjoying yourself behind that commander pose, huh?
%politics_program_dahlia_635%	You bet.
%politics_program_dahlia_636%	Hahaha.
%politics_program_dahlia_639%	I got one!
%politics_program_dahlia_640%	"Power in numbers!"
%politics_program_dahlia_641%	Mmm... It's good. I'd say it suits you.
%politics_program_dahlia_642%	What do you say, Fortuna?
%politics_program_dahlia_644%	Any ideas for a slogan?
%politics_program_dahlia_647%	"Make our coven great again."
%politics_program_dahlia_648%	I really like "Power in numbers."
%politics_program_dahlia_649%	"Stronger together."
%politics_program_dahlia_650%	"A real sisterhood."
%politics_program_dahlia_651%	"A very happy coven."
%politics_program_dahlia_656%	"Make our coven great again."
%politics_program_dahlia_658%	No fucking way.
%politics_program_dahlia_659%	Why?
%politics_program_dahlia_660%	Did you come up with that yourself?
%politics_program_dahlia_661%	Yeah, what's the problem?
%politics_program_dahlia_662%	That was used by an abominable human being on Earth.
%politics_program_dahlia_664%	No way I'm letting Dahlia run under that slogan.
%politics_program_dahlia_665%	Think of something else. Anything else.
%politics_program_dahlia_666%	Uh... Ok, sorry.
%politics_program_dahlia_671%	I really like "Power in numbers."
%politics_program_dahlia_673%	I know right!?
%politics_program_dahlia_674%	To think we'd discover after so many centuries that I'm some kind of political genius!
%politics_program_dahlia_675%	Hahaha, it really embodies your intentions.
%politics_program_dahlia_676%	The referendum system, scattering Aedana's remains so we can become more diverse...
%politics_program_dahlia_677%	Yes!!
%politics_program_dahlia_678%	It is good, yes.
%politics_program_dahlia_681%	Let's roll with it, then.
%politics_program_dahlia_686%	"Stronger together."
%politics_program_dahlia_687%	Mmm... very simple, but it does the job.
%politics_program_dahlia_688%	I don't know, isn't it what any coven should aspire to? That's why we are in a coven to begin with.
%politics_program_dahlia_689%	Yes, yes. Simple is good.
%politics_program_dahlia_691%	I like the word "strong" and I like being together.
%politics_program_dahlia_692%	A slogan is all about marketing, and needs to sell the idea of a better future.
%politics_program_dahlia_693%	You're right, Dahlia. Stronger and together are both quite desirable terms.
%politics_program_dahlia_695%	I'd be proud to run under this motto! Let's do it!
%politics_program_dahlia_700%	"A real sisterhood."
%politics_program_dahlia_701%	Mmm... very loaded, I like it.
%politics_program_dahlia_702%	Loaded how?
%politics_program_dahlia_703%	It implies that what Aedana built wasn't a real sisterhood, but it doesn't insult her directly.
%politics_program_dahlia_704%	Oooh! I like that.
%politics_program_dahlia_705%	I'd be happy to insult her directly too, but this is super elegant, works for me.
%politics_program_dahlia_707%	Plus sisterhood is a beautiful word!
%politics_program_dahlia_708%	Yeah?
%politics_program_dahlia_710%	Yes! Let's make sisterhood our flag!
%politics_program_dahlia_715%	"A very happy coven."
%politics_program_dahlia_717%	Pffft... haha, really?
%politics_program_dahlia_718%	Hey, what's the matter?
%politics_program_dahlia_719%	Ah, sorry... haha... it's not really... sophisticated.
%politics_program_dahlia_720%	Childish, to put it bluntly.
%politics_program_dahlia_721%	But that's what I want! A very happy coven!
%politics_program_dahlia_722%	Ah... sweet child.
%politics_program_dahlia_724%	I don't know, it feels super wholesome to me. Hahaha.
%politics_program_dahlia_726%	I mean, I'd be happy to run under that motto.
%politics_program_dahlia_727%	I suggest you change it, but it's your slogan.
%politics_program_dahlia_728%	If you're fond of it, I'll make it work.
%politics_program_dahlia_729%	Are you sure you want to go with "a very happy coven?"
%politics_program_dahlia_732%	Yes. Fuck you. I want "a very happy coven."
%politics_program_dahlia_733%	Ah... ok, let's choose a different one.
%politics_program_dahlia_738%	Yes. Fuck you. I want "a very happy coven."
%politics_program_dahlia_739%	Haha, ok, ok, relax.
%politics_program_dahlia_740%	You ok with it, Dahlia?
%politics_program_dahlia_742%	Yeah, why not!?
%politics_program_dahlia_743%	Let's own it!
%politics_program_dahlia_746%	"A very happy coven" it is.
%politics_program_dahlia_747%	Right.
%politics_program_dahlia_752%	Ah... ok, let's choose a different one.
%politics_program_dahlia_753%	Don't get mad.
%politics_program_dahlia_754%	I just don't want us to run under what looks like the title of a comedy film.
%politics_program_dahlia_756%	Hahahaha.
%politics_program_dahlia_757%	Shut up.
%politics_program_dahlia_760%	Fine, fine.
%politics_program_dahlia_764%	Perfect. We're almost done.
%politics_program_dahlia_765%	What else?
%politics_program_dahlia_766%	We just need to start campaigning, right?
%politics_program_dahlia_767%	Yes, and for that we need the ultimate, most classical form of propaganda.
%politics_program_dahlia_768%	A poster.
%politics_program_dahlia_769%	What for? It's not like there are any streets in space to plaster with Dahlia's face.
%politics_program_dahlia_770%	We'll send posters to everyone we know from inside and outside the coven.
%politics_program_dahlia_771%	Try to have them set up in common spaces, like temples or cosmic markets.
%politics_program_dahlia_773%	That's a great idea, I'm in!
%politics_program_dahlia_775%	Do we know any cool artists?
%politics_program_dahlia_777%	Fortuna, I was thinking that your new cards have a lot of style.
%politics_program_dahlia_778%	What do you say? Want to compose a nice poster for our friend?
%politics_program_dahlia_779%	Are you sure? I don't...
%politics_program_dahlia_781%	YES! YES! YES! Make a poster for me, Fortuna!!
%politics_program_dahlia_782%	Mmm...
%politics_program_dahlia_784%	Pleeeeease!!!
%politics_program_dahlia_785%	Come on. You're really talented, let's just squeeze your artist juices.
%politics_program_dahlia_786%	Ah, what the hell... Here we go.
%politics_program_jasmine_3%	Ready to review the program?
%politics_program_jasmine_6%	Ah... give me some more time.
%politics_program_jasmine_7%	Yes, let's do this.
%politics_program_jasmine_11%	Ah... give me some more time.
%politics_program_jasmine_12%	Sure, take your time.
%politics_program_jasmine_16%	Yes, let's do this.
%politics_program_jasmine_19%	Alright. The floor is yours, Jasmine.
%politics_program_jasmine_21%	Yay! This is so exciting!
%politics_program_jasmine_23%	Ok, here's my plan:
%politics_program_jasmine_25%	Judgment will be performed by a quorum of the four eldest witches, in agreement with the leader.
%politics_program_jasmine_27%	That is the sweetest candy of her program for the old lot.
%politics_program_jasmine_30%	Enforcement will work with a system of strikes. I still haven't decided how many yet, but should a Witch accumulate enough warnings she will be expelled from the coven.
%politics_program_jasmine_31%	Way less radical than exile and worst case scenario is the freedom to start anew elsewhere.
%politics_program_jasmine_32%	I'd sign up for that right now.
%politics_program_jasmine_34%	Regarding Forbidden Arts, I don't plan to change a thing. Anything deemed dangerous by the eldest Witches will be banned.
%politics_program_jasmine_36%	Then, for Mortal Affairs, I propose a model of protection and guidance.
%politics_program_jasmine_37%	That's nice and all, but... What is good for humanity? What should we protect them from?
%politics_program_jasmine_38%	That'll be determined by the quorum of the eldest.
%politics_program_jasmine_39%	I see. Good.
%politics_program_jasmine_41%	Lastly, as for Witch Duties, I say we go with a policy of no vigilance.
%politics_program_jasmine_43%	We should trust that every sister will have the coven's interests in mind.
%politics_program_jasmine_44%	There's no need to evaluate or impose any duties on any member.
%politics_program_jasmine_47%	As for the trending topic, we need to devour Aedana's corpse so we all become more powerful.
%politics_program_jasmine_48%	Gotcha.
%politics_program_jasmine_49%	Fortuna, take a minute to interiorize Jasmine's program.
%politics_program_jasmine_50%	Sure.
%politics_program_jasmine_51%	Done?
%politics_program_jasmine_53%	Done.
%politics_program_jasmine_54%	Perfect. So tell me...
%politics_program_jasmine_55%	What do you think is the best strategy to undermine her program?
%politics_program_jasmine_57%	Hey!
%politics_program_jasmine_58%	What's the meaning of this?
%politics_program_jasmine_59%	Assessing our opponent's weaknesses is important, but it's imperative we're even more strict in detecting ours.
%politics_program_jasmine_61%	Ah, ok...
%politics_program_jasmine_62%	So, Fortuna.
%politics_program_jasmine_63%	What would you say is the best strategy to undermine Jasmine's plan?
%politics_program_jasmine_66%	These lax policies will incentivize foul play.
%politics_program_jasmine_67%	These plans benefit the powerful and forsake novices.
%politics_program_jasmine_68%	Individualism will fracture the community.
%politics_program_jasmine_72%	These lax policies will incentivize foul play.
%politics_program_jasmine_73%	Good point. Lack of consequences and no vigilance at all may lead to terrible events.
%politics_program_jasmine_74%	Our rivals could scare both conservatives and young voters away from Jasmine should they choose to focus on this point.
%politics_program_jasmine_78%	These plans benefit the powerful and forsake novices.
%politics_program_jasmine_79%	Mmm... interesting. If our opponents adopt this stance they may polarize the coven's opinion...
%politics_program_jasmine_80%	But in the long run, Dahlia could gather the support of the young and the weak, plus the support of the most compassionate elders.
%politics_program_jasmine_81%	We should be careful with this one.
%politics_program_jasmine_85%	Individualism will fracture the community.
%politics_program_jasmine_86%	Very good point. And a fractured sisterhood is a weak sisterhood, or no sisterhood at all, we could say.
%politics_program_jasmine_87%	If our opponents focus on this issue, it'll weaken Jasmine's support and could snatch many voters from her side.
%politics_program_jasmine_88%	We should be ready to propose a sensible alternative without compromising Jasmine's plans too much.
%politics_program_jasmine_92%	This is already harder than I expected...
%politics_program_jasmine_93%	Be strong, Jasmine.
%politics_program_jasmine_94%	We're only just getting started.
%politics_program_jasmine_95%	...What?
%politics_program_jasmine_96%	I did my research on you, too.
%politics_program_jasmine_98%	Born in a small English town during the Industrial Revolution, circa 1800.
%politics_program_jasmine_99%	That puts you in a cultural sweet spot for amassing the sympathies of the coven.
%politics_program_jasmine_100%	You're a young Witch in the eyes of the eldest, medieval and ancient Witches, but not so alien as us contemporanean Witches, with our world wars, TV, internet, and other global "lunacies."
%politics_program_jasmine_101%	You are young enough to get along with us, but you are also considered to be part of the "last decent generation," according to the most conservative Witches.
%politics_program_jasmine_102%	Well...
%politics_program_jasmine_104%	That's good! Isn't it?
%politics_program_jasmine_105%	My reading so far into your politics is that you are pushing for a liberal revision of Aedana's system, removing the most tyrannical mechanisms by reducing punishment and responsibilities.
%politics_program_jasmine_106%	That will maintain the status quo, but give more room for individualism and personal enterprise, free from many duties and the fear of failure.
%politics_program_jasmine_108%	You don't mince your words, huh...
%politics_program_jasmine_109%	But that analysis was as fair as it was sharp.
%politics_program_jasmine_111%	I'm truly happy that you're on our side.
%politics_program_jasmine_113%	Thank you.
%politics_program_jasmine_114%	Let's keep pushing forward.
%politics_program_jasmine_117%	Fortuna.
%politics_program_jasmine_118%	What would you say is Jasmine's strongest point?
%politics_program_jasmine_121%	She's extremely intelligent and manipulative.
%politics_program_jasmine_122%	She is a pillar of the community.
%politics_program_jasmine_123%	Her apparent innocence and frailty.
%politics_program_jasmine_124%	Her resourcefulness.
%politics_program_jasmine_125%	Her charming mother-like aura.
%politics_program_jasmine_129%	She's extremely intelligent and manipulative.
%politics_program_jasmine_131%	She knows how to read people and how to work them for her interests.
%politics_program_jasmine_132%	Whoa, strong declarations from a friend.
%politics_program_jasmine_134%	Fortuna...
%politics_program_jasmine_135%	I mean, you're really kind and thoughtful. I don't even think you do it on purpose most of the time, it's just your nature.
%politics_program_jasmine_136%	But... you have this way of talking people into things, you know.
%politics_program_jasmine_138%	Ah... I appreciate the sincerity.
%politics_program_jasmine_139%	I understand. It's good news, in any case.
%politics_program_jasmine_140%	This is the hardest quality to battle against. They won't be able to overpower Jasmine dialectically.
%politics_program_jasmine_144%	She's a pillar of the community.
%politics_program_jasmine_145%	She helps and provides for many people with her garden, and has many contacts and friends.
%politics_program_jasmine_147%	Thank you!
%politics_program_jasmine_148%	Mmm... that sure puts her ahead in the race from the very start.
%politics_program_jasmine_149%	It'll be hard for our opponents to compete with people's trust in Jasmine.
%politics_program_jasmine_153%	Her apparent innocence and frailty.
%politics_program_jasmine_156%	"Apparent," huh? I see where you're going with this.
%politics_program_jasmine_158%	Hahaha, you know me well.
%politics_program_jasmine_160%	Jasmine has this quality that makes anyone want to protect and support her.
%politics_program_jasmine_161%	Yeah, I can see how she could become a saint-like figure. An innocent martyr that is devoted to her coven.
%politics_program_jasmine_162%	Nothing but good will for her sisters. Let's follow Saint Jasmine.
%politics_program_jasmine_163%	That's a bit over the top, maybe.
%politics_program_jasmine_165%	But I see what you mean. I can try to play with those qualities.
%politics_program_jasmine_169%	Her resourcefulness.
%politics_program_jasmine_170%	She always manages to find a way out of any problem.
%politics_program_jasmine_171%	Plus her garden provides her with a great variety of tools to deal with just about any situation.
%politics_program_jasmine_172%	She has many contacts and smart ideas.
%politics_program_jasmine_174%	Ah, I don't know how to react to so many compliments.
%politics_program_jasmine_176%	She's going to be hard to corner, that's for sure.
%politics_program_jasmine_177%	Mix that with your fortune telling and we have a winning combination.
%politics_program_jasmine_179%	Yay! We're unstoppable! Hahaha.
%politics_program_jasmine_180%	Hahahaha.
%politics_program_jasmine_186%	Her charming mother-like aura.
%politics_program_jasmine_187%	Mmm... right. A mother figure could well become the prom queen of this race.
%politics_program_jasmine_188%	Many voters decide based on instinct rather than analysis. And Jasmine's persona promises to be an excellent caretaker for the lot of us.
%politics_program_jasmine_189%	And that's what I plan to become!
%politics_program_jasmine_193%	Now to her flaws.
%politics_program_jasmine_195%	Uh, oh...
%politics_program_jasmine_196%	What would you say is Jasmine's weakest point?
%politics_program_jasmine_199%	Her anxiety. She gets stressed easily.
%politics_program_jasmine_200%	Envy.
%politics_program_jasmine_201%	Her compassion.
%politics_program_jasmine_202%	She's easy to intimidate.
%politics_program_jasmine_203%	Vanity. She worries too much about appearances.
%politics_program_jasmine_207%	Her anxiety. She gets stressed easily.
%politics_program_jasmine_208%	Oh, my... that's true.
%politics_program_jasmine_209%	Mmm, that's really easy to exploit.
%politics_program_jasmine_210%	That's a flaw that will trigger almost automatically just by competing for leadership.
%politics_program_jasmine_211%	I'm sure our rivals will try to push your buttons so you lose focus and mess up.
%politics_program_jasmine_212%	You need to prepare for that.
%politics_program_jasmine_213%	...
%politics_program_jasmine_215%	I understand.
%politics_program_jasmine_216%	I will be strong.
%politics_program_jasmine_221%	Envy.
%politics_program_jasmine_222%	Really?
%politics_program_jasmine_223%	Really!?
%politics_program_jasmine_224%	Yes, and sorry, but you do a poor job of hiding it.
%politics_program_jasmine_225%	Ah... I wasn't expecting this...
%politics_program_jasmine_226%	You may be right, though...
%politics_program_jasmine_227%	Well, in any case, don't worry.
%politics_program_jasmine_228%	Unless our rivals come up with creative ways of triggering your envy, this is something that's easy to keep in check.
%politics_program_jasmine_230%	...I think.
%politics_program_jasmine_233%	This is new to me. But sure, I'll keep it in check.
%politics_program_jasmine_237%	Her compassion.
%politics_program_jasmine_239%	Aw...
%politics_program_jasmine_240%	That sounds more like a virtue, but you're right, compassion is something exploitable in its own way.
%politics_program_jasmine_241%	Taking pity on your rivals can be the ruin of a leader.
%politics_program_jasmine_243%	Nah, don't worry...
%politics_program_jasmine_244%	I'm not as soft as Fortuna thinks, hehe.
%politics_program_jasmine_248%	She's easy to intimidate.
%politics_program_jasmine_249%	Oof... that's going to be an important pitfall should our opponents decide to play rough.
%politics_program_jasmine_250%	Not necessarily meaning that they'll act aggressively, of course. But there are many ways to produce threats and fears to throw Jasmine off her game.
%politics_program_jasmine_251%	Oh, no...
%politics_program_jasmine_253%	The meanest Witches in this race are on your side, though.
%politics_program_jasmine_254%	We got you.
%politics_program_jasmine_256%	Haha, that's good to hear.
%politics_program_jasmine_260%	Vanity. She worries too much about appearances.
%politics_program_jasmine_262%	Whoa, you went in for the kill, huh?
%politics_program_jasmine_263%	I mean, it doesn't make you a bad person or anything, but it's true.
%politics_program_jasmine_264%	I know, it stings precisely because you're right.
%politics_program_jasmine_265%	Mmm... If they manage to dig up some dirt on you and use it in a public forum it could break your composure.
%politics_program_jasmine_266%	In that case I'm not really worried. There's not much dirt to find on this Witch.
%politics_program_jasmine_267%	Let's hope they don't produce any lies, then.
%politics_program_jasmine_269%	Oh my gods! They won't stoop that low, right? It's Dahlia and Cupressa we're talking about!
%politics_program_jasmine_270%	It depends on how desperate they get.
%politics_program_jasmine_272%	No. I don't want to believe that.
%politics_program_jasmine_273%	And we won't resort to lies under any circumstances.
%politics_program_jasmine_274%	Alright, alright. Understood.
%politics_program_jasmine_279%	Phew...
%politics_program_jasmine_281%	Now do I get to do the same with Fortuna? Hahaha.
%politics_program_jasmine_282%	Ah... If you think it's necessary...
%politics_program_jasmine_284%	I'm kidding. It wasn't really that bad. I'm sure it wasn't easy for you either.
%politics_program_jasmine_286%	Thank you so much. You're a good friend.
%politics_program_jasmine_288%	You're doing great, Jasmine.
%politics_program_jasmine_290%	Now what? Are we set for the campaign?
%politics_program_jasmine_292%	I say now we take a moment to reevaluate our program.
%politics_program_jasmine_293%	After this self-analysis, we might find some aspects we could adjust to increase our chances.
%politics_program_jasmine_301%	Mmm... Ok? What would you change?
%politics_program_jasmine_302%	Just to be extra clear, I won't budge regarding Judgment. That's like the main pillar of my program.
%politics_program_jasmine_303%	And of course, it's imperative we devour Aedana so we can become stronger.
%politics_program_jasmine_304%	Very well.
%politics_program_jasmine_305%	Fortuna, based on what we've studied so far...
%politics_program_jasmine_307%	What do you think could improve from Jasmine's program?
%politics_program_jasmine_310%	Law Enforcement.
%politics_program_jasmine_311%	Forbidden Arts.
%politics_program_jasmine_312%	Mortal Affairs.
%politics_program_jasmine_313%	Witch Duties.
%politics_program_jasmine_314%	It's perfect like this.
%politics_program_jasmine_318%	It's perfect like this.
%politics_program_jasmine_323%	Ok. That's a substantial change, yeah.
%politics_program_jasmine_324%	Very well, I'm fine with it!
%politics_program_jasmine_325%	Do you want to change anything else?
%politics_program_jasmine_326%	Mmm...
%politics_program_jasmine_327%	Eh... One change is alright, but I still want it to be my program.
%politics_program_jasmine_328%	I'm ok with some compromise, but that's enough.
%politics_program_jasmine_331%	You heard the boss.
%politics_program_jasmine_334%	Are you happy with this change or do you want to focus on another point of the program?
%politics_program_jasmine_337%	I'm happy with this program.
%politics_program_jasmine_338%	Mmm... I'd like to reconsider.
%politics_program_jasmine_342%	I'm happy with this program.
%politics_program_jasmine_344%	That settles it, then!
%politics_program_jasmine_348%	Mmm... I'd like to reconsider.
%politics_program_jasmine_350%	Oh! What do you propose, then?
%politics_program_jasmine_354%	Law Enforcement.
%politics_program_jasmine_355%	Ok. These are the current stances:
%politics_program_jasmine_356%	Jasmine wants to set up a system of warnings leading to expulsion.
%politics_program_jasmine_357%	Dahlia advocates for amicable agreement supported by the Arbitrage Office.
%politics_program_jasmine_358%	Cupressa wants to keep exile as punishment.
%politics_program_jasmine_364%	What do you think would be the best system for Law Enforcement?
%politics_program_jasmine_367%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_jasmine_368%	(Ponder warnings leading to expulsion.)
%politics_program_jasmine_369%	Let's stay with the warnings and expulsion system.
%politics_program_jasmine_370%	(Ponder amicable resolution.)
%politics_program_jasmine_371%	Let's switch to amicable resolution.
%politics_program_jasmine_372%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_jasmine_373%	Let's go with community service.
%politics_program_jasmine_378%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_jasmine_379%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_jasmine_385%	Jasmine's solution of letting Witches accumulate strikes and, in the event they fail to behave, expelling them from the coven seems quite humane.
%politics_program_jasmine_386%	It's not a bad idea. It doesn't rob anyone of their freedom and the ultimate punishment is like... ultimate freedom, actually.
%politics_program_jasmine_387%	If you don't fit in here, just find a coven to match your philosophy or stay independent.
%politics_program_jasmine_388%	On the other hand, it's exploitable. Witches will be able to cross the line several times without any consequences before they gather too many strikes.
%politics_program_jasmine_389%	And then they'll be trapped into behaving ideally or losing membership... Mmm...
%politics_program_jasmine_390%	In any case, it's not like they can just go and kill another Witch. The Magical Pact stands above our warning system.
%politics_program_jasmine_391%	The warnings allow for mischief, but I guess it's tolerable? Not all Witches are going to be ill-willed.
%politics_program_jasmine_392%	That's the whole point to me. I expect my sisters to always have the coven in mind. The strikes are there to remind you in case you lose sight of that.
%politics_program_jasmine_393%	If a Witch is ill-willed, she should be expelled with or without the warning system.
%politics_program_jasmine_394%	Mmm... I see...
%politics_program_jasmine_400%	Dahlia's idea about believing in amicable resolution may seem naive but... what is there to police, really, if we already have the Arbitrage Office?
%politics_program_jasmine_401%	Mmm... it's ideal, and quite beautiful to trust in our sisters' ability to coexist.
%politics_program_jasmine_402%	But the Arbitrage Office only really covers the Magical Pact.
%politics_program_jasmine_403%	Shouldn't we have a way to mediate more mundane conflicts within the coven?
%politics_program_jasmine_404%	The Arbitrage Office won't interfere in issues like who has rights over a newly discovered domain or who should be responsible for a common project gone wrong.
%politics_program_jasmine_405%	What do we do in those cases?
%politics_program_jasmine_406%	I guess that Dahlia would leave that in the hands of a referendum.
%politics_program_jasmine_407%	We could do the same but leave unresolvable matters at the discretion of the quorum of the elders, on a case by case basis.
%politics_program_jasmine_408%	A bit feudal for my taste, but I guess it works for a community this small.
%politics_program_jasmine_409%	That being said:
%politics_program_jasmine_415%	Mmm... I have troubled feelings towards punishment as a method of enforcing the law.
%politics_program_jasmine_416%	It keeps law and order through fear. But we can't expect everyone to behave... Isn't there a way to make punishment constructive?
%politics_program_jasmine_417%	Constructive how? Send bad witches to detention to do some magical studies?
%politics_program_jasmine_418%	Hahaha, not that, but hey... That may be an idea.
%politics_program_jasmine_419%	What about community service?
%politics_program_jasmine_420%	Elaborate.
%politics_program_jasmine_421%	Instead of expelling members or, gods forbid, sending them to exile...
%politics_program_jasmine_422%	We could set up a system of assigning hours of community service depending on the severity of the infraction.
%politics_program_jasmine_423%	Tending other Witches' gardens, harvesting magic for the coven, helping the explorers... whatever's needed, really.
%politics_program_jasmine_424%	Oh! That's a cool idea!
%politics_program_jasmine_425%	I don't know if it'll look childish or weak in the eyes of some Witches, but it'll benefit the community in the long run, yeah.
%politics_program_jasmine_426%	I'm not against it if you trust it'll improve our program!
%politics_program_jasmine_427%	Alright.
%politics_program_jasmine_431%	Let's stay with the warnings and expulsion system.
%politics_program_jasmine_432%	Ok, in that case...
%politics_program_jasmine_436%	Let's switch to amicable resolution.
%politics_program_jasmine_442%	Let's go with community service.
%politics_program_jasmine_448%	Forbidden Arts.
%politics_program_jasmine_449%	Very well.
%politics_program_jasmine_450%	These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_jasmine_451%	Cupressa wants to continue banning whatever she deems dangerous. Same as Jasmine.
%politics_program_jasmine_452%	I believe it's better to not toy with what we don't understand, yeah.
%politics_program_jasmine_453%	Dahlia wants to give free access to any kind of magic, but to enforce education so we all know what we're dealing with.
%politics_program_jasmine_458%	How do you want to go about dealing with Forbidden Arts?
%politics_program_jasmine_461%	(Ponder banning.)
%politics_program_jasmine_462%	Let's stick to banning.
%politics_program_jasmine_463%	(Ponder free access and education.)
%politics_program_jasmine_464%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_jasmine_465%	Let's go with the permit system.
%politics_program_jasmine_471%	Mmm... So far the policy on banning dangerous arts has kept us safe.
%politics_program_jasmine_475%	Ahem... you sure?
%politics_program_jasmine_476%	What's that?
%politics_program_jasmine_477%	Ah, nothing. Go on.
%politics_program_jasmine_479%	It's not so much a matter of the dangers of these arts but of them falling into the wrong hands.
%politics_program_jasmine_480%	Powerful or dangerous arts could be a great asset for the coven... but opening the doors to use them may lead to some catastrophic consequences.
%politics_program_jasmine_481%	I agree, we shouldn't mess with this point.
%politics_program_jasmine_486%	It's a waste that our coven can't benefit from some of the most powerful arts, even if they're dangerous.
%politics_program_jasmine_487%	Maybe we shouldn't grant access instantly, but we could open them up gradually as we educate our members on the implications and responsibilities of each spell.
%politics_program_jasmine_488%	It's a bit risky, but it'll make us way stronger in the long run.
%politics_program_jasmine_490%	Absolutely not! We can't leave the forbidden arts unchecked!
%politics_program_jasmine_491%	Studying them and teaching our sisters about them would only increase the temptation to turn to them.
%politics_program_jasmine_492%	These arts are forbidden for a reason.
%politics_program_jasmine_494%	This is one of the points that scares me most from Dahlia's program. We need to put a stop to her plans.
%politics_program_jasmine_495%	Wow. Ok. I understand.
%politics_program_jasmine_497%	Thank you.
%politics_program_jasmine_503%	There must be some middle ground between banning and free access.
%politics_program_jasmine_504%	Some summonings or spells can save lives. They could even protect us from major evils.
%politics_program_jasmine_505%	There's so much to achieve with the careful application of some of the Forbidden Arts, so...
%politics_program_jasmine_507%	Uh, oh... I don't like where this is going...
%politics_program_jasmine_508%	What about extending permits?
%politics_program_jasmine_509%	Make it so a Witch can apply to have access to certain spells or rituals, and if the coven deems the applicant's purpose and aptitude appropriate, allow them to make use of them.
%politics_program_jasmine_511%	Oh! That's not such a bad idea, actually!
%politics_program_jasmine_512%	If permits are extended by the quorum of the elders we could keep any deviant uses of the dangerous arts in check.
%politics_program_jasmine_513%	That's an interesting compromise. You two know more about forbidden arts than I do, so I'll go with whatever you trust is better.
%politics_program_jasmine_517%	Let's stick with banning.
%politics_program_jasmine_518%	Ok, in that case...
%politics_program_jasmine_522%	Let's go with the permit system.
%politics_program_jasmine_528%	Mortal Affairs.
%politics_program_jasmine_529%	Ok. These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_jasmine_530%	Dahlia proposes cutting all ties. She believes that we shouldn't abuse our privilege over them and just leave them be.
%politics_program_jasmine_531%	Cupressa wants to continue exploiting them for our benefit.
%politics_program_jasmine_532%	On the other hand, Jasmine says we should guide them, take care of them.
%politics_program_jasmine_538%	How do you suggest we deal with Mortal Affairs?
%politics_program_jasmine_541%	(Ponder guidance.)
%politics_program_jasmine_542%	I'm fine with guiding mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_543%	(Ponder cutting all ties.)
%politics_program_jasmine_544%	Let's go for cutting ties with mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_545%	(Ponder exploitation.)
%politics_program_jasmine_546%	Let's go with exploiting mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_547%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_jasmine_548%	Let's go with revealing our existence to mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_554%	So far the coven has been exploiting mortals under Aedana's command.
%politics_program_jasmine_555%	Maybe it's time we repay the service mortal societies have been inadvertently offering us.
%politics_program_jasmine_556%	That's a good angle. Although taking care of them entails many responsibilities, as well as needing time and resources.
%politics_program_jasmine_557%	We'll be giving up some of our coven's momentum to charity.
%politics_program_jasmine_558%	Not that that's necessarily bad, but it's something to bear in mind if we choose this option.
%politics_program_jasmine_559%	I'm fine with it.
%politics_program_jasmine_560%	My objective is not to become the most powerful coven, but the best.
%politics_program_jasmine_561%	Mmm... I see...
%politics_program_jasmine_567%	To be honest, I don't care much about mortals or Earth or whatever other society in this universe.
%politics_program_jasmine_568%	And if you think about it, I believe most people would prefer to not have Witches meddling with their lives.
%politics_program_jasmine_569%	Mmm... You may be right.
%politics_program_jasmine_570%	It's arrogant to think that they need our guidance or protection.
%politics_program_jasmine_571%	Yeah, maybe. On the other hand, we would forfeit many valuable resources. Mortals have been a great source of magic power and inspiration for our coven.
%politics_program_jasmine_572%	However, cutting ties will also cut all the shady practices and wrongdoings some Witches have been pushing on mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_573%	And, to some extent, it'll let us focus on our own affairs, instead of dealing with petty disputes over humans.
%politics_program_jasmine_574%	Ah... this one hasn't got an easy answer.
%politics_program_jasmine_575%	What do you think, Fortuna?
%politics_program_jasmine_581%	Should we continue exploiting mortals?
%politics_program_jasmine_582%	I mean, it's not like we were putting them through a grinder and exporting canned people.
%politics_program_jasmine_583%	They aren't aware of the exploitation to begin with. Some of them are even happier thanks to some spells our coven has cast on their communities.
%politics_program_jasmine_585%	Uh... are you sure?
%politics_program_jasmine_587%	It's the most powerful position, to be honest.
%politics_program_jasmine_588%	Ideals are beautiful, but truth be told, our coven benefits a great deal from our current relationship with mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_589%	To keep exploiting them is objectively good for the coven, but morally dubious for many Witches. It could be a tough sell among some voters.
%politics_program_jasmine_590%	Mmm... That's a good point.
%politics_program_jasmine_591%	But I know for a fact that the eldest Witches will be in favor of anything that brings more power to the coven.
%politics_program_jasmine_592%	I can work with either option, depending on what you want to bet on. So...
%politics_program_jasmine_598%	What else could we do about our relationship with mortals?
%politics_program_jasmine_599%	I don't know... if you want to propose an alternative for Jasmine's program it should be something drastically different.
%politics_program_jasmine_600%	The current stances cover every base so far.
%politics_program_jasmine_601%	What about this: We reveal the existence of Witches to mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_603%	What!?
%politics_program_jasmine_605%	Whoa, coming out strong. What's your angle?
%politics_program_jasmine_606%	Whatever decision we make regarding mortals will be morally gray, since they don't know about us.
%politics_program_jasmine_607%	What I propose here is a simple concept: Truth.
%politics_program_jasmine_609%	Truth! What a powerful word!
%politics_program_jasmine_610%	It'll definitely stir some chaos at the beginning, but in the end, wouldn't it be better if we develop a working relationship and make them aware of our capabilities?
%politics_program_jasmine_611%	Let them ask directly for what they need?
%politics_program_jasmine_613%	That is beautiful. But didn't you pay attention in school? Humanity has a troubling relationship with Witches. They burned us for sport.
%politics_program_jasmine_615%	Oh my god... that's true.
%politics_program_jasmine_616%	They burned poor innocent women. What can they really do about the real deal? It's like revealing the existence of lions to a rabbit.
%politics_program_jasmine_617%	They can hide or reject us, but in no way will they be able to hurt us.
%politics_program_jasmine_619%	Heh, you're underestimating mortals' drive to destroy things. But sure, that could make our program look strong. We can spin a good angle from it.
%politics_program_jasmine_621%	Prepare to be attacked in any debates, though.
%politics_program_jasmine_623%	Truth be told, mortals don't scare me. If anything, I pity them. Fortuna is right.
%politics_program_jasmine_624%	Revealing our existence is an honest approach. One I could be proud of.
%politics_program_jasmine_625%	I'm game if you think this can work.
%politics_program_jasmine_629%	I'm fine with guiding mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_630%	Ok, in that case...
%politics_program_jasmine_634%	Let's go with cutting all ties with mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_640%	Let's go with exploiting mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_646%	Let's go with revealing our existence to mortals.
%politics_program_jasmine_652%	Witch Duties.
%politics_program_jasmine_653%	Ok. These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_jasmine_654%	Dahlia wants to institute some sort of Magical Tax, have every Witch share some of their magic output for common projects.
%politics_program_jasmine_655%	Cupressa wants to keep Aedana's quarterly controls.
%politics_program_jasmine_656%	Then, on our side, Jasmine advocates for freedom and trust, to believe that every Witch will always have the coven's best interests in mind.
%politics_program_jasmine_662%	What do you suggest we do about Witch Duties?
%politics_program_jasmine_665%	(Ponder freedom and trust.)
%politics_program_jasmine_666%	Let's stick to freedom and trust.
%politics_program_jasmine_667%	(Ponder the magical tax.)
%politics_program_jasmine_668%	(Ponder quarterly controls.)
%politics_program_jasmine_669%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_jasmine_670%	Let's go with the mentorship program.
%politics_program_jasmine_676%	The coven's been pretty burdened for centuries now with Aedana's abusive control.
%politics_program_jasmine_677%	I don't know if complete freedom is a wise option, but it is an option that our sisters will welcome with open arms.
%politics_program_jasmine_678%	You bet. We're in need of some rest and communal self-care.
%politics_program_jasmine_679%	Should it fail to work for whatever reason we could always review it in the future.
%politics_program_jasmine_680%	Yeah, but... Unless we discover our community is extremely proactive and they pitch in voluntarily, it's certain we will fall behind other covens in just a few decades.
%politics_program_jasmine_681%	Maybe it's not all about power and competition. We could turn this into a more independent, healthier and happier association.
%politics_program_jasmine_682%	Mmm... I see your point. Happiness before power.
%politics_program_jasmine_688%	It may be interesting to adopt Dahlia's idea of a Magical Tax.
%politics_program_jasmine_689%	It doesn't require any specific actions to serve the coven, and it's pretty fair since we'll be asking for a percentage of every Witch's magical output, whatever form that takes.
%politics_program_jasmine_690%	No one should be worried about failing controls. You can go about your existence however you want provided you contribute to the coven's magical reserve.
%politics_program_jasmine_691%	It'll also open the door for us to attempt some ambitious projects, since that much energy from so many Witches will be a tremendous asset to work with.
%politics_program_jasmine_692%	It'll drag down personal development, though. Our sisters are used to having their full magical reserves to invest in their personal enterprises.
%politics_program_jasmine_693%	So in the end it's a matter of putting collectivism over individualism. Having said that...
%politics_program_jasmine_694%	You're too quiet, Jasmine. What do you think?
%politics_program_jasmine_695%	Oh! I think it's a wonderful idea.
%politics_program_jasmine_697%	But it's Dahlia's! We shouldn't steal it for our program!
%politics_program_jasmine_699%	I have my pride, you know! Hahaha!
%politics_program_jasmine_700%	Oh, shit. You're so jealous right now, right?
%politics_program_jasmine_702%	Yes.
%politics_program_jasmine_703%	Hah... in that case:
%politics_program_jasmine_709%	I know it'll be controversial to keep Aedana's quarterly controls, but...
%politics_program_jasmine_710%	From what I've heard, it puts our coven well ahead of our friends and foes, right?
%politics_program_jasmine_711%	Yes, that is true.
%politics_program_jasmine_712%	Right now it's the strongest option to keep our coven at the top of its game.
%politics_program_jasmine_713%	It comes at the cost of sacrificing personal happiness, but if you want to lead a powerful coven this is your best bet.
%politics_program_jasmine_714%	Being the strongest is overrated though, especially if the price is our members' wellbeing.
%politics_program_jasmine_715%	It all depends on what your objectives are.
%politics_program_jasmine_716%	Yeah, no. I'm sorry but I'm vetoing this one.
%politics_program_jasmine_717%	It works directly against the kind of coven I want to create.
%politics_program_jasmine_718%	Understood.
%politics_program_jasmine_724%	There must be another way to make our coven stronger without abusing our members and without degrading the spirit of being a community...
%politics_program_jasmine_725%	Mmm... in all the years you've spent in this coven, what would you say has helped bring out your A game the most?
%politics_program_jasmine_726%	Demand? Inspiration? Sharing resources?
%politics_program_jasmine_727%	Mmm... Oh! I know:
%politics_program_jasmine_728%	Mentorship.
%politics_program_jasmine_729%	My mentor Yu-ënia has been a cornerstone in my development as a Witch.
%politics_program_jasmine_730%	What do you say we institute a mentorship program?
%politics_program_jasmine_732%	That's a great idea!
%politics_program_jasmine_734%	Right now, one of the most pressing issues within our coven is the power gap between novices and elders.
%politics_program_jasmine_735%	It'll help to tighten the relationship between different generations of Witches, too.
%politics_program_jasmine_736%	I like it.
%politics_program_jasmine_737%	But this idea will be way better received among novices than among elders.
%politics_program_jasmine_738%	Old Witches won't be really getting anything out of this deal, so it'll be a tough sell for the less charitable conservatives.
%politics_program_jasmine_739%	Mmm... that's right.
%politics_program_jasmine_740%	A mentorship is something that requires a lot of time and work, so it'll get in the way of many of the elders' plans.
%politics_program_jasmine_741%	You yourself will be forced to take on some apprentices. Think about what that'll mean for your lifestyle.
%politics_program_jasmine_742%	Mmm... I see...
%politics_program_jasmine_746%	Let's stick to freedom and trust.
%politics_program_jasmine_747%	Ok, in that case...
%politics_program_jasmine_751%	Let's go with the mentorship program.
%politics_program_jasmine_757%	Now... Take a minute to look at our program.
%politics_program_jasmine_758%	Internalize it, believe it, make it yours.
%politics_program_jasmine_759%	Jasmine, you're going to have to defend all these decisions in front of your rivals and the whole coven.
%politics_program_jasmine_760%	I'm determined to do so, yes.
%politics_program_jasmine_761%	We're gonna need to sell the concept of it.
%politics_program_jasmine_762%	And for that...
%politics_program_jasmine_766%	We're going to need a slogan.
%politics_program_jasmine_769%	Ugh... I don't know, a slogan sounds cheap.
%politics_program_jasmine_770%	A slogan! Finally, something fun!
%politics_program_jasmine_774%	Ugh... I don't know, a slogan sounds cheap.
%politics_program_jasmine_775%	Come on, don't try to play it cool.
%politics_program_jasmine_776%	We need a slogan. It's not like other politicians use them to have fun.
%politics_program_jasmine_777%	They really do work.
%politics_program_jasmine_778%	Ok, whatever...
%politics_program_jasmine_782%	A slogan! Finally, something fun!
%politics_program_jasmine_783%	It's been fun all the way for me so far, hehe.
%politics_program_jasmine_784%	You're really enjoying yourself behind that commander pose, huh?
%politics_program_jasmine_785%	You bet.
%politics_program_jasmine_786%	Hahaha.
%politics_program_jasmine_788%	You're really good at this, Patrice!
%politics_program_jasmine_791%	Any ideas for a slogan?
%politics_program_jasmine_793%	Mmm... What about...
%politics_program_jasmine_794%	"Let our love grow."
%politics_program_jasmine_795%	Mmm... Yeah, I'd say it suits you.
%politics_program_jasmine_796%	What do you say, Fortuna?
%politics_program_jasmine_798%	Any ideas for a slogan?
%politics_program_jasmine_801%	"Make our coven great again."
%politics_program_jasmine_802%	I really like "Let our love grow."
%politics_program_jasmine_803%	"Stronger together."
%politics_program_jasmine_804%	"A real sisterhood."
%politics_program_jasmine_805%	"A very happy coven."
%politics_program_jasmine_810%	"Make our coven great again."
%politics_program_jasmine_812%	No fucking way.
%politics_program_jasmine_813%	Why?
%politics_program_jasmine_814%	Did you come up with that yourself?
%politics_program_jasmine_815%	Yeah, what's the problem?
%politics_program_jasmine_816%	That was used by an abominable human being on Earth.
%politics_program_jasmine_818%	No way I'm letting Jasmine run under that slogan.
%politics_program_jasmine_819%	Think of something else. Anything else.
%politics_program_jasmine_820%	Uh... Ok, sorry.
%politics_program_jasmine_825%	I really like "Let our love grow."
%politics_program_jasmine_827%	Really!?
%politics_program_jasmine_828%	Ah, that makes me so happy!
%politics_program_jasmine_829%	Yes, it really embodies your essence and intentions.
%politics_program_jasmine_830%	Plus you're a gardener witch. The "grow" concept is perfect.
%politics_program_jasmine_831%	Yay!!
%politics_program_jasmine_832%	It is good, yes.
%politics_program_jasmine_835%	Let's roll with it, then.
%politics_program_jasmine_840%	"Stronger together."
%politics_program_jasmine_841%	Mmm... very simple, but it does the job.
%politics_program_jasmine_842%	I don't know, isn't it what any coven should aspire to? That's why we're in a coven to begin with.
%politics_program_jasmine_843%	Yes, yes. Simple is good.
%politics_program_jasmine_844%	I think it works, too!
%politics_program_jasmine_845%	A slogan is all about marketing, and needs to sell the idea of a better future.
%politics_program_jasmine_846%	Stronger and together are both quite desirable terms.
%politics_program_jasmine_847%	Great point. I say we go with it!
%politics_program_jasmine_852%	"A real sisterhood."
%politics_program_jasmine_853%	Mmm... very loaded, I like it.
%politics_program_jasmine_854%	Loaded how?
%politics_program_jasmine_855%	It implies that what Aedana built wasn't a real sisterhood, but it doesn't insult her directly.
%politics_program_jasmine_856%	Mmm... I'm not keen on that bit about degrading Aedana's work, but...
%politics_program_jasmine_857%	It's a slogan that pleads for change and the word sisterhood is a lovable term.
%politics_program_jasmine_859%	I'd be happy to run under this slogan!
%politics_program_jasmine_860%	Yeah?
%politics_program_jasmine_862%	Yes! Let's make sisterhood our flag!
%politics_program_jasmine_866%	"A very happy coven."
%politics_program_jasmine_868%	Pffft... haha, really?
%politics_program_jasmine_869%	Hey, what's the matter?
%politics_program_jasmine_870%	Ah, sorry... haha... it's not really... sophisticated.
%politics_program_jasmine_871%	Childish, to put it bluntly.
%politics_program_jasmine_872%	But that's what I want! A very happy coven!
%politics_program_jasmine_873%	Ah... sweet child.
%politics_program_jasmine_874%	It's not... that bad?
%politics_program_jasmine_875%	I mean, it sounds super pure to me.
%politics_program_jasmine_876%	I suggest you change it, but it's your slogan.
%politics_program_jasmine_877%	If you're fond of it, I'll make it work.
%politics_program_jasmine_878%	Are you sure you want to go with "a very happy coven?"
%politics_program_jasmine_881%	Yes. Fuck you. I want "a very happy coven."
%politics_program_jasmine_882%	Ah... ok, let's choose a different one.
%politics_program_jasmine_887%	Yes. Fuck you. I want "a very happy coven."
%politics_program_jasmine_888%	Haha, ok, ok, relax.
%politics_program_jasmine_889%	You ok with it, Jasmine?
%politics_program_jasmine_890%	Yeah! It's a beautiful desire!
%politics_program_jasmine_891%	Let's own it!
%politics_program_jasmine_893%	"A very happy coven" it is.
%politics_program_jasmine_894%	Right.
%politics_program_jasmine_899%	Ah... ok, let's choose a different one.
%politics_program_jasmine_900%	Don't get mad.
%politics_program_jasmine_901%	I just don't want us to run under what looks like the title of a comedy film.
%politics_program_jasmine_903%	Hahahaha.
%politics_program_jasmine_904%	Shut up.
%politics_program_jasmine_907%	Fine, fine.
%politics_program_jasmine_911%	Perfect. We're almost done.
%politics_program_jasmine_912%	What else?
%politics_program_jasmine_913%	We just need to start campaigning, right?
%politics_program_jasmine_914%	Yes, and for that we need the ultimate, most classical form of propaganda.
%politics_program_jasmine_915%	A poster.
%politics_program_jasmine_916%	What for? It's not like there are any streets in space to plaster with Jasmine's face.
%politics_program_jasmine_917%	We‘ll send posters to everyone we know from inside and outside the coven.
%politics_program_jasmine_918%	Try to have them set up in common spaces, like temples or cosmic markets.
%politics_program_jasmine_919%	Oh, my, how embarrassing...
%politics_program_jasmine_920%	Isn't that going to be too much...?
%politics_program_jasmine_921%	That's why I'm here, to do all the nasty marketing you're too self-conscious to do.
%politics_program_jasmine_923%	Fortuna, I was thinking that your new cards have a lot of style.
%politics_program_jasmine_924%	What do you say? Want to compose a nice poster for our friend?
%politics_program_jasmine_925%	Are you sure? I don't...
%politics_program_jasmine_927%	Come on, Fortuna! Pleeeeease!
%politics_program_jasmine_928%	Mmm...
%politics_program_jasmine_930%	Come on. You're really talented, let's just squeeze your artist juices.
%politics_program_jasmine_931%	Ah, what the hell... Here we go.
%politics_program_solo_3%	Ready to define our program?
%politics_program_solo_6%	Ah... give me some more time.
%politics_program_solo_7%	Yes, let's do this.
%politics_program_solo_11%	Ah... give me some more time.
%politics_program_solo_12%	Sure, take your time.
%politics_program_solo_16%	Yes, let's do this.
%politics_program_solo_17%	Alright.
%politics_program_solo_20%	We'll go over every point, assess our options, make some choices, and when we have a first draft we can review any aspect to iron out the program.
%politics_program_solo_21%	It's ok to borrow some ideas you may fancy from your rivals, but try to make a program that's unique enough to be your own.
%politics_program_solo_22%	Ok.
%politics_program_solo_23%	First point: Judgment.
%politics_program_solo_24%	Right now this is where our rivals stand:
%politics_program_solo_25%	Jasmine wants to form a quorum of the eldest.
%politics_program_solo_26%	Dahlia wants to introduce judgment by referendum.
%politics_program_solo_27%	Cupressa wants to keep Aedana's Runic Judgment.
%politics_program_solo_33%	What type of Judgment do you prefer?
%politics_program_solo_36%	(Ponder Runic Judgment.)
%politics_program_solo_37%	(Ponder quorum of the eldest.)
%politics_program_solo_38%	Let's go with the quorum of the eldest.
%politics_program_solo_39%	(Ponder referendum.)
%politics_program_solo_40%	Let's go with the referendum.
%politics_program_solo_41%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_solo_42%	Let's go with the ministry system.
%politics_program_solo_47%	Mmm... Is there something interesting about Runic Judgment?
%politics_program_solo_48%	That is completely off the table.
%politics_program_solo_49%	It would imply conserving Aedana's corpse, and I doubt you want that.
%politics_program_solo_50%	Yeah, you're right. Aedana needs to be wiped out of our lives.
%politics_program_solo_51%	Ok, so...
%politics_program_solo_57%	Mmm... Jasmine's idea about forming a quorum of the oldest--wisest--Witches may be the most sensible approach.
%politics_program_solo_58%	It's not a bad idea, no.
%politics_program_solo_59%	Even if we don't get along too well with the eldest, they are indeed the most powerful and knowledgeable of the coven.
%politics_program_solo_60%	On the other hand, even if it removes the tyranny of Aedana from the system, it still leaves all power in the hands of a few, and not a very diverse lot at that.
%politics_program_solo_61%	But that's almost an innate quality about power. It creates inequality by definition.
%politics_program_solo_62%	Anyway.
%politics_program_solo_68%	Mmm... Isn't Dahlia's idea of dividing all the power among members via referendum a beautiful idea?
%politics_program_solo_69%	It is beautiful, indeed.
%politics_program_solo_70%	It would be something far-fetched for a bigger society, but provided the coven stays within the hundreds it's feasible.
%politics_program_solo_71%	It'd still be quite cumbersome, and we need to keep in mind that the most popular option isn't always what's truly best.
%politics_program_solo_72%	But it will always keep the majority satisfied.
%politics_program_solo_73%	Will this make us weaker but happier?
%politics_program_solo_74%	I can't tell. It's never been done before in a coven that I know of.
%politics_program_solo_75%	Ok, so...
%politics_program_solo_81%	Maybe there's another option to manage the coven?
%politics_program_solo_82%	Something fair but effective.
%politics_program_solo_83%	What do you have in mind?
%politics_program_solo_84%	To have a leadership that decides on everything without the community's input is problematic.
%politics_program_solo_85%	But leaving all executive control in the hands of everyone will produce erratic results.
%politics_program_solo_86%	I'm thinking of establishing some sort of... Ministries? To compartmentalize power.
%politics_program_solo_87%	Appoint experts in every matter to deal with law, exploration, magic development, resource management, culture...
%politics_program_solo_88%	Anything, really, set up as many ministries as necessary.
%politics_program_solo_89%	All ministers will work along with the leader, but they would have the last word on their respective competences, since they would be the ideal person to make informed decisions about each issue.
%politics_program_solo_90%	Mmm... And how will these ministers be appointed? Do these positions rotate? What happens if someone more competent shows up, is the minister replaced?
%politics_program_solo_91%	I mean, it's really interesting on paper, and it'll be quite effective to have dedicated Witches on every important matter.
%politics_program_solo_92%	But this will probably breed many power-struggles within the coven, fighting for these positions or trying to earn the favor of certain ministers.
%politics_program_solo_93%	I see...
%politics_program_solo_94%	Not that the other options don't have downsides. I'm just pointing out what could go wrong with this idea.
%politics_program_solo_95%	I think it is still worth giving it a shot if you like it. If you're at the helm I'm sure you'll run a tight ship and put together an excellent team. I'll help you.
%politics_program_solo_96%	Yeah, avoiding corruption in this scenario relies on having a capable leader.
%politics_program_solo_97%	You are a capable leader. I think you're ready to deal with any kind of Judgment system you decide to go with, so, having said that...
%politics_program_solo_101%	Let's go with the quorum of the eldest.
%politics_program_solo_107%	Let's go with the referendum.
%politics_program_solo_113%	Let's go with the ministry system.
%politics_program_solo_119%	Gotcha.
%politics_program_solo_120%	Now, to Law Enforcement.
%politics_program_solo_121%	These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_solo_122%	Jasmine wants to set up a system of warnings, leading to expulsion.
%politics_program_solo_123%	Dahlia advocates for amicable agreement supported by the Arbitrage Office.
%politics_program_solo_124%	Cupressa wants to keep exile as punishment.
%politics_program_solo_130%	What type of Law Enforcement do you prefer?
%politics_program_solo_133%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_solo_134%	(Ponder warnings leading to expulsion.)
%politics_program_solo_135%	Let's go with the warnings and expulsion system.
%politics_program_solo_136%	(Ponder amicable resolution.)
%politics_program_solo_137%	Let's go with amicable resolution.
%politics_program_solo_138%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_solo_139%	Let's go with community service.
%politics_program_solo_144%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_solo_145%	Fuck exile.
%politics_program_solo_151%	Jasmine's solution of letting Witches accumulate strikes and, in the event they fail to behave, expelling them from the coven seems quite humane.
%politics_program_solo_152%	It's not a bad idea. It doesn't rob anyone of their freedom and the ultimate punishment is like... ultimate freedom, actually.
%politics_program_solo_153%	If you don't fit in here, just find a coven to match your philosophy or stay independent.
%politics_program_solo_154%	On the other hand, it's exploitable. Witches will be able to cross the line several times without any consequences before they gather too many strikes.
%politics_program_solo_155%	And then they'll be trapped into behaving ideally or losing membership... Mmm...
%politics_program_solo_156%	In any case, it's not like they can just go and kill another Witch. The Magical Pact stands above our warnings system.
%politics_program_solo_157%	The warnings allow for mischief, but I guess it's tolerable? Not all Witches are going to be ill-willed.
%politics_program_solo_163%	Dahlia's idea about believing in amicable resolution may seem naive but... what is there to police, really, if we already have the Arbitrage Office?
%politics_program_solo_164%	Mmm... it's ideal, and quite beautiful to trust in our sisters' ability to coexist.
%politics_program_solo_165%	But the Arbitrage Office only really covers the Magical Pact.
%politics_program_solo_166%	Shouldn't we have a way to mediate more mundane conflicts within the coven?
%politics_program_solo_167%	The Arbitrage Office won't interfere in issues like who has rights over a newly discovered domain or who should be responsible for a common project gone wrong.
%politics_program_solo_168%	What do we do in those cases?
%politics_program_solo_169%	I guess that Dahlia would leave that in the hands of a referendum.
%politics_program_solo_172%	We could do the same but with a proper organism, a minister of justice that deals with unresolvable conflicts on a case by case basis.
%politics_program_solo_173%	This is getting closer and closer to mortal society, but sure, that was supposed to work for millennia on Earth.
%politics_program_solo_174%	Anyway.
%politics_program_solo_177%	We could do the same but leaving unresolvable matters to the discretion of the quorum of the elders, on a case by case basis.
%politics_program_solo_178%	A bit feudal for my taste, but I guess it works for a community this small.
%politics_program_solo_179%	Anyway.
%politics_program_solo_182%	We could do the same.
%politics_program_solo_183%	That could lead to a mob mentality.
%politics_program_solo_184%	Popular Witches will hold a lot of power.
%politics_program_solo_185%	Yeah, maybe...
%politics_program_solo_186%	Anyway.
%politics_program_solo_192%	Mmm... I have troubled feelings towards punishment as a method of enforcing the law.
%politics_program_solo_193%	It keeps law and order through fear. But we can't expect everyone to behave... Isn't there a way to make punishment constructive?
%politics_program_solo_194%	Constructive how? Send bad witches to detention to do some magical studies?
%politics_program_solo_195%	Hahaha, not that, but hey... That may be an idea.
%politics_program_solo_196%	What about community service?
%politics_program_solo_197%	Elaborate.
%politics_program_solo_198%	Instead of expelling members or, gods forbid, sending them to exile...
%politics_program_solo_199%	We could set up a system of assigning hours of community service depending on the severity of the infraction.
%politics_program_solo_200%	Tending other Witches' gardens, harvesting magic for the coven, helping the explorers... whatever is needed, really.
%politics_program_solo_201%	We could pull that off, yeah.
%politics_program_solo_202%	I don't know if it'll look childish or weak in the eyes of some Witches, but it'll benefit the community in the long run, definitely.
%politics_program_solo_203%	Alright.
%politics_program_solo_207%	Let's go with the warnings and expulsion system.
%politics_program_solo_213%	Let's go with amicable resolution.
%politics_program_solo_219%	Let's go with community service.
%politics_program_solo_225%	Understood.
%politics_program_solo_226%	Next is Forbidden Arts.
%politics_program_solo_227%	These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_solo_228%	Jasmine and Cupressa want to continue banning whatever they deem dangerous.
%politics_program_solo_229%	Dahlia wants to give free access to any kind of magic, but to enforce education so we all know what we're dealing with.
%politics_program_solo_234%	How do you want to go about dealing with Forbidden Arts?
%politics_program_solo_237%	(Ponder banning.)
%politics_program_solo_238%	Let's go with banning.
%politics_program_solo_239%	(Ponder free access and education.)
%politics_program_solo_240%	Let's go with free access and education.
%politics_program_solo_241%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_solo_242%	Let's go with the permit system.
%politics_program_solo_248%	Mmm... So far the policy on banning dangerous arts has kept us safe.
%politics_program_solo_252%	I know, it's quite hypocritical on my part to even consider banning since I summoned a Behemoth myself.
%politics_program_solo_253%	But it's precisely because I've experienced it that I'm aware of the implications of turning to forbidden magic.
%politics_program_solo_255%	It's not so much a matter of the dangers of these arts but of them falling into the wrong hands.
%politics_program_solo_256%	Powerful or dangerous arts could be a great asset for the coven... but opening the doors to use them may lead to some catastrophic consequences.
%politics_program_solo_257%	I don't have strong opinions on this point. Your call.
%politics_program_solo_263%	It's a waste that our coven can't benefit from some of the most powerful arts, even if they're dangerous.
%politics_program_solo_264%	Maybe we shouldn't grant access instantly, but we could open them up gradually as we educate our members on the implications and responsibilities of each spell.
%politics_program_solo_265%	It's a bit risky, but it'll make us way stronger in the long run.
%politics_program_solo_266%	Maybe? I'm not well versed on this topic, so I'll trust your judgment.
%politics_program_solo_272%	There must be some middle ground between banning and free access.
%politics_program_solo_273%	Some summonings or spells can save lives. They could even protect us from major evils.
%politics_program_solo_274%	There's much to achieve with the careful application of some of the Forbidden Arts, so...
%politics_program_solo_275%	What about extending permits?
%politics_program_solo_276%	Make it so a Witch can apply to have access to certain spells or rituals, and if the coven deems the applicant's purpose and aptitude appropriate, allow them to make use of them.
%politics_program_solo_277%	That is an interesting compromise. You know more about forbidden arts than I do, so I'll go with whatever you think is better.
%politics_program_solo_281%	Let's go with banning.
%politics_program_solo_287%	Let's go with free access and education.
%politics_program_solo_293%	Let's go with the permit system.
%politics_program_solo_299%	Wonderful.
%politics_program_solo_300%	Now onto Mortal Affairs.
%politics_program_solo_301%	These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_solo_302%	Jasmine says we should guide them, take care of them.
%politics_program_solo_303%	Dahlia proposes cutting all ties. She believes that we shouldn't abuse our privilege over them and just let them be.
%politics_program_solo_304%	Cupressa wants to continue exploiting them for our benefit.
%politics_program_solo_310%	What's your stance on Mortal Affairs?
%politics_program_solo_313%	(Ponder guidance.)
%politics_program_solo_314%	Let's go with guiding mortals.
%politics_program_solo_315%	(Ponder cutting all ties.)
%politics_program_solo_316%	Let's go for cutting ties with mortals.
%politics_program_solo_317%	(Ponder exploitation.)
%politics_program_solo_318%	Let's go with exploiting mortals.
%politics_program_solo_319%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_solo_320%	Let's go with revealing our existence to mortals.
%politics_program_solo_326%	So far the coven has been exploiting mortals under Aedana's command.
%politics_program_solo_327%	Maybe it's time we repay the service mortal societies have been inadvertently offering us.
%politics_program_solo_328%	That's a good angle. Although taking care of them entails many responsibilities, as well as needing time and resources.
%politics_program_solo_329%	We'll be giving up some of our coven's momentum to charity.
%politics_program_solo_330%	Not that that's necessarily bad, but it's something to bear in mind if we choose this option.
%politics_program_solo_331%	I see...
%politics_program_solo_337%	To be honest, I don't care much about mortals or Earth or whatever other society in this universe.
%politics_program_solo_338%	And if you think about it, I believe most people would prefer to not have Witches meddling with their lives.
%politics_program_solo_339%	Yeah, maybe. On the other hand, we would forfeit many valuable resources. Mortals have been a great source of magic power and inspiration for our coven.
%politics_program_solo_340%	However, cutting ties will also cut all the shady practices and wrongdoings some Witches have been pushing on mortals.
%politics_program_solo_341%	And, to some extent it'll let us focus on our own affairs, instead of dealing with petty disputes over humans.
%politics_program_solo_342%	What do you think?
%politics_program_solo_348%	Should we continue exploiting mortals?
%politics_program_solo_349%	I mean, it's not like we were putting them through a grinder and exporting canned people.
%politics_program_solo_350%	They aren't aware of this exploitation to begin with. Some of them are even happier thanks to some spells our coven has cast on their communities.
%politics_program_solo_351%	It's the most powerful position, to be honest.
%politics_program_solo_352%	Ideals are beautiful, but truth be told, our coven benefits a great deal from our current relationship with mortals.
%politics_program_solo_353%	To keep exploiting them is objectively good for the coven, but morally dubious for many Witches. It could be a tough sell among some voters.
%politics_program_solo_354%	I can work with either option, depending what you want to bet on. So...
%politics_program_solo_360%	What else could we do about our relationship with mortals?
%politics_program_solo_361%	I don't know... if you want to propose an alternative for our program it should be something drastically different.
%politics_program_solo_362%	Just some iteration on our rivals' ideas would feel uninspired or derivative.
%politics_program_solo_363%	What about this: We reveal the existence of Witches to mortals.
%politics_program_solo_364%	Whoa, coming out strong. What's your angle?
%politics_program_solo_365%	Whatever decision we make regarding mortals will be morally gray, since they don't know about us.
%politics_program_solo_366%	What I propose here is a simple concept: Truth.
%politics_program_solo_367%	It'll definitely stir some chaos at the beginning, but in the end, wouldn't it be better if we develop a working relationship and make them aware of our capabilities?
%politics_program_solo_368%	Let them ask directly for what they need?
%politics_program_solo_369%	That is beautiful. But didn't you pay attention in school? Humanity has a troubling relationship with Witches. They burned us for sport.
%politics_program_solo_370%	They burned poor innocent women. What can they really do about the real deal? It's like revealing the existence of lions to a rabbit.
%politics_program_solo_371%	They can hide or reject us, but in no way will they be able to hurt us.
%politics_program_solo_373%	Heh, you're underestimating mortals' drive to destroy things. But sure, that could make our program look strong. We can spin a good angle from it.
%politics_program_solo_375%	Prepare to be attacked in any debates, though.
%politics_program_solo_379%	Let's go with guiding mortals.
%politics_program_solo_385%	Let's go with cutting all ties with mortals.
%politics_program_solo_391%	Let's go with exploiting mortals.
%politics_program_solo_397%	Let's go with revealing our existence to mortals.
%politics_program_solo_403%	Roger that.
%politics_program_solo_404%	Let's talk about Witch Duties.
%politics_program_solo_405%	These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_solo_406%	Jasmine advocates for freedom and trust, for believing that every Witch will always have the coven's best interests in mind.
%politics_program_solo_407%	Dahlia wants to institute some sort of Magical Tax, have every Witch share some of their magic output for common projects.
%politics_program_solo_408%	Cupressa wants to keep Aedana's quarterly controls.
%politics_program_solo_414%	What are we going to do about Witch Duties?
%politics_program_solo_417%	(Ponder freedom and trust.)
%politics_program_solo_418%	Let's go with freedom and trust.
%politics_program_solo_419%	(Ponder the magical tax.)
%politics_program_solo_420%	Let's go with the magical tax.
%politics_program_solo_421%	(Ponder quarterly controls.)
%politics_program_solo_422%	Let's go with quarterly controls.
%politics_program_solo_423%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_solo_424%	Let's go with the mentorship program.
%politics_program_solo_430%	The coven's been pretty burdened for centuries now with Aedana's abusive control.
%politics_program_solo_431%	I don't know if complete freedom is a wise option, but it is an option that our sisters will welcome with open arms.
%politics_program_solo_432%	Should it fail to work for whatever reason we could always review it in the future.
%politics_program_solo_433%	Unless we discover our community is extremely proactive and they pitch in voluntarily, it's certain we'll fall behind other covens in just a few decades.
%politics_program_solo_434%	But maybe it's not all about power and competition, and we could turn this into a more independent, laid back association.
%politics_program_solo_435%	In any case, my analysis is that this will weaken us in the long run. So...
%politics_program_solo_441%	It may be interesting to adopt Dahlia's idea of a Magical Tax.
%politics_program_solo_442%	It doesn't require any specific actions to serve the coven, and it's pretty fair since we'll be asking for a percentage of every Witch's magical output, whatever form that takes.
%politics_program_solo_443%	No one should be worried about failing controls. You can go about your existence however you want provided you contribute to the coven's magical reserve.
%politics_program_solo_444%	It'll also open the door for us to attempt some ambitious projects, since that much energy from so many Witches will be a tremendous asset to work with.
%politics_program_solo_445%	It'll drag down personal development, though. Our sisters are used to having their full magical reserves to invest in their personal enterprises.
%politics_program_solo_446%	So in the end it's a matter of putting collectivism over individualism. Having said that...
%politics_program_solo_452%	I know it'll be controversial to keep Aedana's quarterly controls, but...
%politics_program_solo_453%	From what I‘ve heard, it puts our coven well ahead of our friends and foes, right?
%politics_program_solo_454%	Yes, that is true.
%politics_program_solo_455%	Right now it's the strongest option to keep our coven at the top of its game.
%politics_program_solo_456%	It comes at the cost of sacrificing personal happiness, but if you want to lead a powerful coven, this is your best bet.
%politics_program_solo_457%	Being the best may be overrated though, if the price is our members' wellbeing.
%politics_program_solo_458%	It all depends on what your objectives are. We can make either point work in our favor, whatever you prefer.
%politics_program_solo_464%	There must be another way to make our coven stronger without abusing our members and without degrading the spirit of being a community...
%politics_program_solo_465%	Mmm... in all the years you've spent in this coven, what would you say has helped bring your A game the most?
%politics_program_solo_466%	Demand? Inspiration? Sharing resources?
%politics_program_solo_467%	Mmm... Oh! I know:
%politics_program_solo_468%	Mentorship.
%politics_program_solo_469%	My mentor Yu-ënia has been a cornerstone in my development as a Witch.
%politics_program_solo_470%	What do you say we institute a mentorship program?
%politics_program_solo_471%	That's a great idea.
%politics_program_solo_472%	Right now, one of the most pressing issues within our coven is the power gap between novices and elders.
%politics_program_solo_473%	It'll help to tighten the relationship between different generations of Witches, too.
%politics_program_solo_474%	I like it.
%politics_program_solo_475%	But this idea will be way better received among novices than elders.
%politics_program_solo_476%	Old Witches won't be really getting anything out of this deal, so it'll be a tough sell for the less charitable conservatives.
%politics_program_solo_477%	A mentorship is something that requires a lot of time and work, so it'll get in the way of many of the elders' plans.
%politics_program_solo_478%	You yourself will be forced to take on some apprentices. Think about what that'll mean for your lifestyle.
%politics_program_solo_479%	Mmm... I see...
%politics_program_solo_483%	Let's go with freedom and trust.
%politics_program_solo_489%	Let's go with the magical tax.
%politics_program_solo_495%	Let's go with quarterly controls.
%politics_program_solo_501%	Let's go with the mentorship program.
%politics_program_solo_507%	Understood.
%politics_program_solo_508%	And finally, we have the issue of what to do with Aedana's corpse.
%politics_program_solo_509%	These are the stances of our competitors:
%politics_program_solo_510%	Jasmine wants the coven to devour her corpse, that way we will all absorb her magic and become considerably more powerful.
%politics_program_solo_511%	Dahlia wants to scatter her remains, give them back to the cosmos. That way more Witches will be able to ascend and we will become more numerous and diverse.
%politics_program_solo_512%	Cupressa wants to conserve Aedana's corpse to consult with her and keep using her as a channel to talk with the gods.
%politics_program_solo_518%	What do you want to do with Aedana's corpse?
%politics_program_solo_521%	(Ponder devouring Aedana.)
%politics_program_solo_522%	Let's go with devouring Aedana.
%politics_program_solo_523%	(Ponder scattering Aedana's remains.)
%politics_program_solo_524%	Let's go with scattering her remains.
%politics_program_solo_525%	(Ponder conserving Aedana's corpse.)
%politics_program_solo_526%	(Try to come up with a new option.)
%politics_program_solo_527%	Let's go with the superleader option.
%politics_program_solo_533%	Devouring Aedana's corpse is tempting. We will all instantly become more powerful and prepared to confront these times of change.
%politics_program_solo_534%	Yes.
%politics_program_solo_535%	Yes? No witty remarks?
%politics_program_solo_536%	Not that I mind welcoming more Witches, but becoming more powerful will sure come in handy for my job.
%politics_program_solo_537%	Yeah, that's the debate.
%politics_program_solo_538%	I will support you no matter what you choose.
%politics_program_solo_539%	Just bear in mind that advocating for devouring her will earn us the sympathies of the conservatives and discomfort from the novices, and vice versa.
%politics_program_solo_545%	Maybe we should scatter Aedana's remains?
%politics_program_solo_546%	I mean, power for the sake of power is a bit pointless, and allowing more women to ascend and become Witches seems the more humane thing to do.
%politics_program_solo_547%	You're probably right.
%politics_program_solo_548%	Opening the gates to potentially double our size will definitely stir some chaos in these times of change.
%politics_program_solo_549%	But who cares, there's also power in numbers.
%politics_program_solo_550%	Just bear in mind that advocating for scattering Aedana's remains will earn us the sympathies of the novices and discomfort from the elders, and vice versa.
%politics_program_solo_555%	So, Cupressa wants to keep Aedana's corpse as some sort of creepy advisor.
%politics_program_solo_556%	That's right.
%politics_program_solo_557%	Fuck that. I don't want to ever see those golden masks ever again in my life.
%politics_program_solo_558%	Fuck Aedana so hard.
%politics_program_solo_560%	Heheh... Fuck Aedana, alright.
%politics_program_solo_562%	Good riddance.
%politics_program_solo_568%	Mmm... What if...
%politics_program_solo_569%	Nah, that's too much.
%politics_program_solo_570%	Spit it out, we're brainstorming here, a wild idea could lead to something interesting.
%politics_program_solo_571%	What if only the leader gets to eat Aedana, all by herself?
%politics_program_solo_572%	What if you hoard Aedana's power all to yourself, you're saying?
%politics_program_solo_573%	Yes. Become some sort of superleader. If it becomes a tradition, whoever is in charge will become more and more powerful with each generation.
%politics_program_solo_574%	Inheriting all the power of their predecessors.
%politics_program_solo_575%	Working towards a godlike figure who can safeguard the coven from any evil?
%politics_program_solo_576%	That is... dangerous.
%politics_program_solo_577%	Not a lot of people will agree with this plan.
%politics_program_solo_578%	But if you manage to pull it off, you will become extremely fucking powerful.
%politics_program_solo_579%	I don't want to imagine what that would imply for your powers. You will be able to rewrite reality itself if needed.
%politics_program_solo_580%	Mmm...
%politics_program_solo_581%	I'll support you, if that's what you want.
%politics_program_solo_585%	Let's go with devouring Aedana.
%politics_program_solo_591%	Let's go with scattering her remains.
%politics_program_solo_597%	Let's go with the superleader option.
%politics_program_solo_603%	Alright. That's a wrap then.
%politics_program_solo_604%	Let's review the program as a whole now.
%politics_program_solo_613%	Wait a minute, this program is identical to Dahlia's!
%politics_program_solo_616%	Mmm... This program is too similar to Dahlia's.
%politics_program_solo_619%	Wait a minute, this program is identical to Jasmine's!
%politics_program_solo_622%	Mmm... This program is too similar to Jasmine's.
%politics_program_solo_624%	You might as well join her campaign.
%politics_program_solo_625%	Oops.
%politics_program_solo_626%	Yeah, very oops. You'd better change at least a couple of points from the program.
%politics_program_solo_628%	What points would you like to change?
%politics_program_solo_631%	Judgment.
%politics_program_solo_632%	Law Enforcement.
%politics_program_solo_633%	Forbidden Arts.
%politics_program_solo_634%	Mortal Affairs.
%politics_program_solo_635%	Witch Duties.
%politics_program_solo_636%	What to do with Aedana's corpse.
%politics_program_solo_637%	I'm done.
%politics_program_solo_641%	Ok.
%politics_program_solo_645%	Judgment.
%politics_program_solo_648%	Right now we're standing for setting up a ministry system.
%politics_program_solo_651%	Right now we're standing for a quorum of the oldest Witches.
%politics_program_solo_654%	Right now we're standing for a referendum system.
%politics_program_solo_656%	What kind of Judgment would you rather have?
%politics_program_solo_659%	Quorum of the eldest.
%politics_program_solo_660%	Referendum.
%politics_program_solo_661%	Ministry System.
%politics_program_solo_675%	Law Enforcement.
%politics_program_solo_678%	Right now we're planning to set up a community service system.
%politics_program_solo_681%	Right now we're vouching for a warning system leading to expulsion.
%politics_program_solo_684%	Right now we're vouching for amicable resolution.
%politics_program_solo_686%	What kind of Law Enforcement would you rather have?
%politics_program_solo_689%	Warnings leading to expulsion.
%politics_program_solo_690%	Amicable resolution.
%politics_program_solo_691%	Community service.
%politics_program_solo_705%	Forbidden Arts.
%politics_program_solo_708%	Right now we're planning to give out permits depending on the situation.
%politics_program_solo_711%	Right now we stand for banning anything dangerous.
%politics_program_solo_714%	Right now we're vouching for free access and education.
%politics_program_solo_716%	What policy on Forbidden Arts would you rather have?
%politics_program_solo_719%	Banning.
%politics_program_solo_720%	Free access and education.
%politics_program_solo_721%	Extending permits.
%politics_program_solo_733%	...
%politics_program_solo_735%	Mortal Affairs.
%politics_program_solo_739%	Right now we're planning to reveal our existence to mortals and develop a working relationship.
%politics_program_solo_742%	Right now we advocate for guiding and protecting them.
%politics_program_solo_745%	Right now we plan on cutting all ties with mortals.
%politics_program_solo_748%	Right now we plan to keep exploiting them.
%politics_program_solo_750%	What would you rather do about Mortal Affairs?
%politics_program_solo_753%	Guide and protect mortals.
%politics_program_solo_754%	Cut all ties with mortals.
%politics_program_solo_755%	Keep exploiting them.
%politics_program_solo_756%	Reveal our existence.
%politics_program_solo_773%	Witch Duties.
%politics_program_solo_777%	Right now we've decided to go with the mentorship program.
%politics_program_solo_780%	Right now we plan to give absolute freedom and trust Witches to have the coven's best interests in mind.
%politics_program_solo_783%	Right now we want to institute the magical tax.
%politics_program_solo_786%	Right now we plan on keeping the quarterly controls.
%politics_program_solo_788%	What do you want to do with Witch Duties?
%politics_program_solo_791%	Freedom and trust.
%politics_program_solo_792%	Magical tax.
%politics_program_solo_793%	Quarterly controls.
%politics_program_solo_794%	Mentorship program.
%politics_program_solo_811%	What to do with Aedana's corpse.
%politics_program_solo_814%	Right now we're going with your bold idea about becoming a superleader.
%politics_program_solo_817%	Right now we're advocating for devouring Aedana's corpse so we all become more powerful.
%politics_program_solo_820%	Right now we're advocating to scatter Aedana's remains so more women can ascend and become Witches.
%politics_program_solo_822%	What would you rather do with Aedana's corpse?
%politics_program_solo_825%	Devour Aedana's corpse.
%politics_program_solo_826%	Scatter Aedana's remains.
%politics_program_solo_827%	Eat Aedana myself and become a superleader.
%politics_program_solo_841%	I'm done.
%politics_program_solo_844%	This program is unique enough. I believe we are offering quite an interesting option over the plans of our rivals.
%politics_program_solo_845%	Are you happy with it? Would you like to change anything?
%politics_program_solo_848%	I'm happy with this program. Let's move on.
%politics_program_solo_849%	Mmm... I may want to review some points.
%politics_program_solo_853%	I'm happy with this program. Let's move on.
%politics_program_solo_855%	Great. Wonderful. Fantastic.
%politics_program_solo_860%	Mmm... I may want to review some points.
%politics_program_solo_861%	Sure, take your time.
%politics_program_solo_865%	Now... Take a minute to look at our program.
%politics_program_solo_866%	Internalize it, believe it, make it yours.
%politics_program_solo_867%	You are going to have to defend all these decisions in front of your rivals and the whole coven.
%politics_program_solo_868%	But, most importantly, I'm gonna need you to sell the concept of it.
%politics_program_solo_869%	And for that...
%politics_program_solo_873%	We're going to need a slogan.
%politics_program_solo_876%	Ugh... I'd rather do this without slogans.
%politics_program_solo_877%	A slogan! Finally, something fun!
%politics_program_solo_881%	Ugh... I'd rather do this without slogans.
%politics_program_solo_882%	Come on, don't try to play it cool.
%politics_program_solo_883%	We need a slogan. It's not like other politicians use them to have fun.
%politics_program_solo_884%	They really do work.
%politics_program_solo_885%	Ok, whatever...
%politics_program_solo_889%	A slogan! Finally, something fun!
%politics_program_solo_890%	It's been fun all the way for me so far, hehe.
%politics_program_solo_891%	You're really enjoying yourself behind that haughty pose, huh?
%politics_program_solo_892%	You bet.
%politics_program_solo_893%	Hahaha.
%politics_program_solo_896%	What would you like to use as a slogan?
%politics_program_solo_899%	"Make our coven great again."
%politics_program_solo_900%	"Take fate into thy hands."
%politics_program_solo_901%	"Stronger together."
%politics_program_solo_902%	"A real sisterhood."
%politics_program_solo_903%	"A very happy coven."
%politics_program_solo_908%	"Make our coven great again."
%politics_program_solo_910%	No fucking way.
%politics_program_solo_911%	Why?
%politics_program_solo_912%	Did you come up with that yourself?
%politics_program_solo_913%	Yeah, what's the problem?
%politics_program_solo_914%	That was used by an abominable human being on Earth.
%politics_program_solo_916%	No way I'm letting you run under that slogan.
%politics_program_solo_917%	Choose another one.
%politics_program_solo_918%	Uh... Ok, sorry.
%politics_program_solo_923%	"Take fate into thy hands."
%politics_program_solo_925%	Ooh... I like this one. Very on point, given the kind of candidate you are.
%politics_program_solo_926%	You think? It doesn't say much about our program, but...
%politics_program_solo_927%	It doesn't matter. This is all about marketing.
%politics_program_solo_928%	And who doesn't like the idea of controlling their own fate?
%politics_program_solo_929%	This slogan puts the focus on your defining characteristic.
%politics_program_solo_930%	No other candidate can aspire to own this slogan.
%politics_program_solo_931%	Great job.
%politics_program_solo_932%	Haha, thanks.
%politics_program_solo_937%	"Stronger together."
%politics_program_solo_938%	Mmm... very simple, but it does the job.
%politics_program_solo_939%	I don't know. It's what any coven should aspire to, isn't it? That's why we're in a coven to begin with.
%politics_program_solo_940%	Yes, yes. Simple is good.
%politics_program_solo_941%	A slogan is all about marketing, and needs to sell the idea of a better future.
%politics_program_solo_942%	Stronger and together are both quite desirable terms.
%politics_program_solo_943%	Good choice.
%politics_program_solo_948%	"A real sisterhood."
%politics_program_solo_949%	Mmm... very loaded, I like it.
%politics_program_solo_950%	Loaded how?
%politics_program_solo_951%	It implies that what Aedana built wasn't a real sisterhood, but it doesn't insult her directly.
%politics_program_solo_952%	It's a slogan that pleads for change and the word sisterhood is a lovable term.
%politics_program_solo_953%	I can work with this. Great job.
%politics_program_solo_954%	Nice, thank you.
%politics_program_solo_958%	"A very happy coven."
%politics_program_solo_960%	Pffft... haha, really?
%politics_program_solo_961%	Hey, what's the matter?
%politics_program_solo_962%	Ah, sorry... haha... it's not really... sophisticated.
%politics_program_solo_963%	Childish, to put it bluntly.
%politics_program_solo_964%	But that's what I want! A very happy coven!
%politics_program_solo_965%	Ah... sweet child.
%politics_program_solo_966%	I suggest you change it, but it's your slogan.
%politics_program_solo_967%	If you're fond of it, I'll make it work.
%politics_program_solo_968%	Are you sure you want to go with "a very happy coven?"
%politics_program_solo_971%	Yes. Fuck you. I want "a very happy coven."
%politics_program_solo_972%	Ah... ok, let's choose a different one.
%politics_program_solo_977%	Yes. Fuck you. I want "a very happy coven."
%politics_program_solo_978%	Haha, ok, ok, relax.
%politics_program_solo_980%	"A very happy coven" it is.
%politics_program_solo_981%	Right.
%politics_program_solo_986%	Ah... ok, let's choose a different one.
%politics_program_solo_987%	Don't get mad.
%politics_program_solo_988%	I just don't want us to run under what looks like the title of a comedy film.
%politics_program_solo_989%	Shut up.
%politics_program_solo_991%	Fine, fine.
%politics_program_solo_995%	We're almost done.
%politics_program_solo_996%	What else?
%politics_program_solo_997%	We just need to start campaigning, right?
%politics_program_solo_998%	Yes, and for that, we need the ultimate, most classical form of propaganda.
%politics_program_solo_999%	A poster.
%politics_program_solo_1000%	What for? It's not like there are any streets in space to plaster with my face.
%politics_program_solo_1001%	We'll send posters to everyone we know from inside and outside the coven.
%politics_program_solo_1002%	Try to have them set up in common spaces, like temples or cosmic markets.
%politics_program_solo_1003%	Uh... that's not my style at all.
%politics_program_solo_1004%	That's why I'm here, to do all the nasty marketing you're too self-conscious to do.
%politics_program_solo_1005%	I just want all this to be over.
%politics_program_solo_1006%	A few weeks, a couple of months at max, and this will be but a memory.
%politics_program_solo_1007%	You've done two hundred years of exile, I'm sure you can endure this.
%politics_program_solo_1008%	Ok, ok, I give up. Just tell me what to do and I'll do it.
%politics_program_solo_1009%	I was thinking that your new cards have a lot of style.
%politics_program_solo_1010%	What do you say? Want to compose the poster yourself?
%politics_program_solo_1011%	Do I have a choice?
%politics_program_solo_1013%	Heh, not really.
%politics_program_solo_1014%	You're really talented, let's just squeeze your artist juices.
%spread_patrice_intro_2%	Ah... Here we are again.
%spread_patrice_intro_4%	But let me tell you, this is the last time you make me read into your end.
%spread_patrice_intro_14%	You get reincarnated or whatever, you deal with the pain of being alive like the rest of us.
%spread_patrice_intro_15%	Deal.
%spread_patrice_intro_16%	Wait.
%spread_patrice_intro_17%	How does this new deck of yours work?
%spread_patrice_intro_18%	Uhm... For you it's going to be the same. Mechanically speaking it's just like Tarot.
%spread_patrice_intro_19%	But I crafted this deck myself, capturing arcana inside the cards.
%spread_patrice_intro_20%	So I can fine-tune my style of divination and don't need to be so dependent on the classic Tarot symbols.
%spread_patrice_intro_22%	Wow, cool.
%spread_patrice_intro_23%	Ok, show me what you've got.
%spread_patrice_theend_6%	You are destined to go out in a cosmic orgy, your essence scattered throughout a hundred lovers.
%spread_patrice_theend_8%	Nice. Very nice.
%spread_patrice_theend_9%	This more than makes up for giving me cancer.
%spread_patrice_theend_10%	You'll never stop giving me shit for that now, huh?
%spread_patrice_theend_11%	Can you amend the reading to add some Witches from the Machina Cult to the orgy?
%spread_patrice_theend_12%	You gotta see their arms, sis.
%spread_patrice_theend_13%	Hahaha, it doesn't work that way.
%spread_patrice_theend_15%	The cards let me access a selection of possible futures and I scry through them.
%spread_patrice_theend_18%	Can you see how much time I have left?
%spread_patrice_theend_19%	Nope, I'm sorry. But if it didn't come up in the reading, then it's not going to happen anytime soon.
%spread_patrice_theend_20%	Well, that'll have to do, then.
%spread_patrice_theend_25%	You will ascend one more time. You will become a goddess of inspiration and will only be able to interact with this plane through signs and revelations.
%spread_patrice_theend_26%	Really? You gotta be kidding me.
%spread_patrice_theend_27%	Let me rest in peace for once, for god's sake.
%spread_patrice_theend_28%	Ah... I thought you always wanted to be a goddess.
%spread_patrice_theend_30%	Please, I'm a goddess already, bitch.
%spread_patrice_theend_31%	Hahaha, I know, I know.
%spread_patrice_theend_32%	Can you change it?
%spread_patrice_theend_33%	I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.
%spread_patrice_theend_38%	You will be executed for unleashing a terrible force that will obliterate half the Witches in this universe.
%spread_patrice_theend_39%	Wow, Fortuna. Just wow.
%spread_patrice_theend_40%	I mean, it's sick enough that you'd write for me to be executed, but wiping out half of the existing Witches in the process?
%spread_patrice_theend_41%	What's wrong with you?
%spread_patrice_theend_42%	Ah... I'm sorry. I may be the writer but I don't quite control the muses, so to speak.
%spread_patrice_theend_43%	Better get yourself an editor then, because that content sucks.
%spread_patrice_theend_44%	Can't you amend it?
%spread_patrice_theend_45%	I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.
%spread_patrice_theend_50%	You will turn yourself into a gemstone trinket to veil over your favorite student.
%spread_patrice_theend_51%	Pfft... get real.
%spread_patrice_theend_52%	Me? Accepting a student?
%spread_patrice_theend_53%	Let alone having enough students to have a favorite among them?
%spread_patrice_theend_54%	That's the most unlikely prediction you've ever made.
%spread_patrice_theend_55%	You're a great mentor, Patrice.
%spread_patrice_theend_56%	Oh yeah? And what's my resume?
%spread_patrice_theend_57%	You've been a great mentor to me, to your children, and to your grandchildren.
%spread_patrice_theend_58%	That's not the same, that's caring for your kin.
%spread_patrice_theend_59%	Maybe at some point you'll soften and miss those days of raising fine people.
%spread_patrice_theend_60%	I doubt it, but sure, whatever.
%spread_patrice_theend_61%	Can't you write me something more exciting?
%spread_patrice_theend_62%	Hahaha, it doesn't work that way.
%spread_patrice_theend_67%	You will get to witness the end of this universe and perish along with whoever remains to experience the end of it all.
%spread_patrice_theend_68%	So you basically cursed me with eternal life.
%spread_patrice_theend_69%	Not quite. The universe will eventually end.
%spread_patrice_theend_70%	That is an eternity, even by Witch standards.
%spread_patrice_theend_71%	Well, excuse me for wishing you a long existence.
%spread_patrice_theend_72%	I may die of boredom before fulfilling your prophecy, let me tell you.
%spread_patrice_theend_74%	But I guess that watching reality come to an end may be quite an experience.
%spread_patrice_theend_75%	Can't wait.
%spread_patrice_theend_76%	Hahaha, bleak.
%spread_patrice_theend_82%	You will die during a duel with another Witch over some stupid argument.
%spread_patrice_theend_83%	Mmm... I don't hate the idea.
%spread_patrice_theend_84%	But why did you have to make it be over a stupid argument?
%spread_patrice_theend_85%	Can't you make it a bit more epic?
%spread_patrice_theend_86%	Hahaha, it doesn't work that way.
%spread_patrice_theend_91%	You will fall in love with a mortal poet and forsake your powers to be able to live and age next to them.
%spread_patrice_theend_92%	Come on, that's too corny.
%spread_patrice_theend_93%	Quite the writer you are.
%spread_patrice_theend_95%	And I thought my novels were cheesy.
%spread_patrice_theend_96%	You don't like it?
%spread_patrice_theend_97%	Nah, I guess it's nice.
%spread_patrice_theend_98%	As a mortal I didn't get the chance to live through a loving relationship and become a sweet old lady that ages away alongside her true love.
%spread_patrice_theend_99%	So I guess I'll be able to cross that off my bucket list.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_3%	You are going to die at the hands of a Behemoth.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_4%	...
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_5%	Well, it sounds better than bone cancer.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_6%	Can you feel when?
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_7%	This year.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_9%	Oh...
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_10%	I'm so sorry Patrice.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_12%	I'd better start living Witch life to the max, huh?
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_13%	How can you remain so calm in the face of certain death?
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_14%	What can I say? This isn't my first rodeo.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_15%	I'm glad I asked you to read into my end.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_16%	I had a lot of stupid plans that I can ditch now.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_17%	I think I'll go and try my luck at using the Forbidden Door to Pleasure. I've got nothing to lose.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_18%	Ah... this is so...
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_20%	Liberating.
%spread_patrice_theend_fire_21%	Patrice...
%spread_patrice_followup_3%	...
%spread_patrice_followup_6%	So... What do you think of my new deck?
%spread_patrice_followup_7%	It's pretty cool, yeah.
%spread_patrice_followup_8%	I was a bit fed up with Tarot, to be honest.
%spread_patrice_followup_9%	Yeah, me too, now that I think about it.
%spread_patrice_followup_10%	It'll take more time to get bored of these cards since I can keep producing new ones.
%spread_patrice_followup_11%	The illustrations, do you make them yourself?
%spread_patrice_followup_13%	They're pretty cool.
%spread_patrice_followup_14%	I compose them with existing arcana, but they leave a lot of room for creativity.
%spread_patrice_followup_15%	I don't know, it's fun.
%spread_patrice_followup_16%	Happy to hear you're having a good time.
%spread_patrice_followup_18%	Ok, we've dealt with my own demise, what do you say we focus on avoiding yours now?
%spread_patrice_followup_19%	Ah... here we go again.
%spread_patrice_followup_20%	Fine, what do you have in mind?
%spread_patrice_followup_25%	I've never met a Behemoth. I wonder what they're like?
%spread_patrice_followup_26%	...
%spread_patrice_followup_27%	Uh... Is there something you're not telling me?
%spread_patrice_followup_30%	Ah... ok. It's only fair that I confess. (Show Ábramar)
%spread_patrice_followup_31%	No. It's just... I'm still processing this...
%spread_patrice_followup_36%	Ah... ok. It's only fair that I confess.
%spread_patrice_followup_37%	Ábramar, please, show up.
%spread_patrice_followup_40%	Holy fuck, Fortuna.
%spread_patrice_followup_41%	A motherfucking BEHEMOTH!?
%spread_patrice_followup_42%	Pleased to meet you, Patrice.
%spread_patrice_followup_43%	AND IT TALKS!?
%spread_patrice_followup_44%	What do you mean "it talks"? We Behemoths fucking invented language.
%spread_patrice_followup_45%	And I'm not an "it", please refer to me as "he."
%spread_patrice_followup_47%	What have you done, Fortuna...
%spread_patrice_followup_50%	I did what I had to do to survive.
%spread_patrice_followup_51%	I'm sorry, I was desperate...
%spread_patrice_followup_55%	I did what I had to do to survive.
%spread_patrice_followup_57%	Survive!? This will get you executed! Erased from the cosmos!
%spread_patrice_followup_58%	I was living death anyway.
%spread_patrice_followup_59%	200 years alone on this rock is worse than oblivion, Patrice...
%spread_patrice_followup_61%	Ah... Who could blame you, really...
%spread_patrice_followup_63%	Fucking Aedana.
%spread_patrice_followup_67%	I'm sorry, I was desperate...
%spread_patrice_followup_68%	Shit...
%spread_patrice_followup_70%	I swear, I'm going to find Aedana's corpse and give her a postmortem kick in the ass.
%spread_patrice_followup_71%	This is on her.
%spread_patrice_followup_72%	I'm sorry.
%spread_patrice_followup_74%	Wait...
%spread_patrice_followup_76%	Is it Ábramar? The one who'll kill me.
%spread_patrice_followup_79%	Yes. I offered him the life of the one I love the most.
%spread_patrice_followup_80%	Ah... I don't know, maybe.
%spread_patrice_followup_85%	Yes. I offered him the life of the one I love the most.
%spread_patrice_followup_86%	...As payment for my freedom and this deck.
%spread_patrice_followup_88%	Ah...
%spread_patrice_followup_89%	...
%spread_patrice_followup_91%	So you love me that much, huh.
%spread_patrice_followup_92%	I don't know what to say.
%spread_patrice_followup_93%	I didn't even think about who it was that I loved the most when I signed the contract...
%spread_patrice_followup_94%	I... I...
%spread_patrice_followup_95%	It's fine, Fortuna.
%spread_patrice_followup_96%	I wouldn't want it any other way.
%spread_patrice_followup_97%	I'd give my life for you any day.
%spread_patrice_followup_98%	Anything for my little sister.
%spread_patrice_followup_99%	...
%spread_patrice_followup_100%	Come on, don't cry.
%spread_patrice_followup_101%	I had a good run.
%spread_patrice_followup_102%	I'm just happy I get to save you in the end.
%spread_patrice_followup_103%	Big sister status restored.
%spread_patrice_followup_104%	Shut up...
%spread_patrice_followup_105%	Let's focus on how to get you out of this mess so my sacrifice isn't in vain.
%spread_patrice_followup_106%	Will you let me help you?
%spread_patrice_followup_107%	Y-yes... please.
%spread_patrice_followup_109%	Alright.
%spread_patrice_followup_113%	Ah... I don't know, maybe.
%spread_patrice_followup_114%	What do you say, Ábramar? Are you going to kill me?
%spread_patrice_followup_115%	That isn't something I would like to do.
%spread_patrice_followup_116%	...
%spread_patrice_followup_117%	Mhm...
%spread_patrice_followup_118%	Fine, it doesn't matter. It doesn't change anything.
%spread_patrice_followup_119%	Let's focus on making sure that at least one of us lives to see what's ahead, shall we?
%spread_patrice_followup_120%	Again, I don't need saving.
%spread_patrice_followup_121%	Please, just go and enjoy the time you've got left.
%spread_patrice_followup_123%	Ah! No, no, no.
%spread_patrice_followup_124%	You wouldn't refuse your sister's last request, would you?
%spread_patrice_followup_125%	Come on, that's not fair...
%spread_patrice_followup_126%	Suck it up.
%spread_patrice_followup_128%	Here's my plan:
%spread_patrice_followup_132%	No. It's just... I'm still processing this...
%spread_patrice_followup_134%	Ah...
%spread_patrice_followup_135%	It's fine, really.
%spread_patrice_followup_137%	You're finally getting me out of your hair, silly. Chin up.
%spread_patrice_followup_138%	Three centuries started to feel like too much, anyway.
%spread_patrice_followup_139%	I feel beyond ancient at this point.
%spread_patrice_followup_140%	Patrice...
%spread_patrice_followup_141%	Enough with the lamentation. Let's enjoy ourselves while I'm here!
%spread_patrice_followup_142%	That's my wish. Ok?
%spread_patrice_followup_143%	Fine, fine.
%spread_patrice_followup_144%	What do you want to do?
%spread_patrice_followup_149%	I want you to run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_150%	What!? No!
%spread_patrice_followup_151%	I'm deadly serious.
%spread_patrice_followup_152%	When I learned that Aedana died and the coven needed a new leader I automatically thought of you.
%spread_patrice_followup_153%	Your divination makes you the perfect candidate.
%spread_patrice_followup_154%	That's why it pissed me off extra to discover that you could receive visitors this late. We've already lost a lot of time that we could have put into preparing your campaign.
%spread_patrice_followup_155%	I'm sorry about that but... anyway...
%spread_patrice_followup_158%	Clairvoyance isn't the only quality required to lead.
%spread_patrice_followup_159%	We discovered I'm not a reader but a writer, the responsibility...
%spread_patrice_followup_160%	Dahlia and Jasmine are already running.
%spread_patrice_followup_164%	Clairvoyance isn't the only quality required to lead.
%spread_patrice_followup_165%	I don't know shit about high politics.
%spread_patrice_followup_166%	I'm not fit to "rule."
%spread_patrice_followup_167%	Your divination is the most crucial point.
%spread_patrice_followup_168%	And I'm not talking about you running the coven as the dictator Aedana was.
%spread_patrice_followup_169%	You can surround yourself with a wise team, you can confer with the whole community even, but your judgment is what will ultimately set the direction for the coven.
%spread_patrice_followup_173%	We discovered I'm not a reader but a writer, the responsibility...
%spread_patrice_followup_174%	Being a writer makes it even more crucial that you become our leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_175%	What would even be the point of anyone else ruling if you can just sweep away any reality?
%spread_patrice_followup_176%	I could always decide to stop using my powers.
%spread_patrice_followup_177%	Hah, as if.
%spread_patrice_followup_178%	You're never going to surrender your powers, it'd make you too miserable. I know you too well.
%spread_patrice_followup_179%	Just look where you got to when cornered after two centuries of isolation.
%spread_patrice_followup_180%	One day, a critical situation will hit you or the coven, and you're going to take matters into your own hands.
%spread_patrice_followup_181%	If you do so from the position of leader, you'll handle the situation from the best possible perspective, with all the info that there is to have.
%spread_patrice_followup_182%	And more than that, it's your duty to use your extraordinary powers in service of the coven.
%spread_patrice_followup_186%	Dahlia and Jasmine are already running.
%spread_patrice_followup_187%	So?
%spread_patrice_followup_188%	They call dibs on the seat or what?
%spread_patrice_followup_189%	Things will get too tense if I decide to run now.
%spread_patrice_followup_190%	They'll have to deal with it. For god's sake, we're all centuries old, I'd expect--demand--a certain degree of maturity from all of us.
%spread_patrice_followup_191%	You have exactly the same right to run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_193%	Mmm...
%spread_patrice_followup_201%	Dahlia and Jasmine came to ask for my support and I rejected both of them... so I guess it would make sense that I try and go for it myself?
%spread_patrice_followup_203%	You're not the first one to tell me I'd make a great leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_204%	You all are gonna make me believe I should do it.
%spread_patrice_followup_205%	You should. You must. I'll help you.
%spread_patrice_followup_209%	The problem is that I told both Dahlia and Jasmine that I would help them with their campaigns.
%spread_patrice_followup_210%	Why would you tell them that? That's stupid.
%spread_patrice_followup_211%	I'd respect it if you believed in one of your friends becoming the new leader and decided to back them.
%spread_patrice_followup_212%	But you can't support opposing political campaigns!
%spread_patrice_followup_213%	You're going to hinder them both!
%spread_patrice_followup_214%	Let them know that you're running yourself and that you can't support them anymore. It'll be better for everyone.
%spread_patrice_followup_217%	Ah... Ok, I'll do that.
%spread_patrice_followup_218%	No, Patrice. I don't want to run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_222%	Ah... Ok, I'll do that.
%spread_patrice_followup_223%	Finally, you're talking some sense.
%spread_patrice_followup_224%	You're gonna make a great leader, trust me.
%spread_patrice_followup_228%	No, Patrice. I don't want to run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_229%	Come on, Fortuna.
%spread_patrice_followup_230%	This is the opportunity of a lifetime.
%spread_patrice_followup_231%	Think about all the good we'll be able to do.
%spread_patrice_followup_232%	I don't know...
%spread_patrice_followup_233%	Your talent is the best bet any community has to thrive beyond their wildest dreams.
%spread_patrice_followup_234%	But if you're so adamant, at least pick a side.
%spread_patrice_followup_235%	You can become a great advisor, help the coven from the backseat.
%spread_patrice_followup_236%	But you can't support them both. No way.
%spread_patrice_followup_239%	Look, fine, you've convinced me. I'll run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_240%	Fine. I'll stick with Jasmine.
%spread_patrice_followup_241%	Fine. I'll stick with Dahlia.
%spread_patrice_followup_245%	Look, fine, you've convinced me. I'll run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_246%	Finally.
%spread_patrice_followup_247%	You're gonna make a great leader, trust me.
%spread_patrice_followup_251%	Fine. I'll stick with Jasmine.
%spread_patrice_followup_254%	A waste, but I won't force your hand.
%spread_patrice_followup_255%	We can still do a lot of good if the future leader has you as an advisor.
%spread_patrice_followup_256%	Write to Dahlia telling her you won't be able to support her.
%spread_patrice_followup_257%	And then we can invite Jasmine and see how we can help with her campaign.
%spread_patrice_followup_261%	Fine. I'll stick with Dahlia.
%spread_patrice_followup_264%	A waste, but I won't force your hand.
%spread_patrice_followup_265%	We can still do a lot of good if the future leader has you as an advisor.
%spread_patrice_followup_266%	Write to Jasmine to let her know you won't be able to support her.
%spread_patrice_followup_267%	And then we can invite Dahlia and see how we can help with her campaign.
%spread_patrice_followup_271%	Ah, shit... Fortuna.
%spread_patrice_followup_272%	Don't choose Dahlia, come on.
%spread_patrice_followup_273%	What? Why?
%spread_patrice_followup_275%	Dahlia's utopia isn't possible.
%spread_patrice_followup_276%	I reviewed her program and she's going to lead us all to ruin. She's too naive.
%spread_patrice_followup_277%	But...
%spread_patrice_followup_278%	No. It's just not feasible. Trust me.
%spread_patrice_followup_280%	You'd be doing Dahlia a favor if you keep her from becoming the next leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_281%	Whatever. Just tell me already what you want me to do.
%spread_patrice_followup_282%	I want you to run for leader. Or at least not to support Dahlia.
%spread_patrice_followup_285%	Look, fine, you've convinced me. I'll run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_286%	Let me support Jasmine, then.
%spread_patrice_followup_290%	Let me support Jasmine, then.
%spread_patrice_followup_294%	That's fine and all... but I already told Dahlia I'd help her become the next leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_295%	What a pity. Let's hope she takes it well when you tell her you're running for leader yourself.
%spread_patrice_followup_298%	But I don't want to run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_299%	She'll be angry for about five minutes, but it'll be okay.
%spread_patrice_followup_303%	But I don't want to run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_304%	Come on, Fortuna. You're gonna make me beg?
%spread_patrice_followup_305%	It's not a matter of begging.
%spread_patrice_followup_306%	Running a coven requires way more than manipulating the future.
%spread_patrice_followup_307%	I'm not ready for that.
%spread_patrice_followup_308%	But you are. You're sensitive and smart, plus you can scry what's ahead. Well, or write what's ahead, whatever.
%spread_patrice_followup_309%	I'll help you with the bureaucracy. We'll make a fine team.
%spread_patrice_followup_312%	Look, fine, you've convinced me. I'll run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_313%	No. I'll stick to my word. I'm helping Dahlia.
%spread_patrice_followup_317%	No. I'll stick to my word. I'm helping Dahlia.
%spread_patrice_followup_320%	A waste, but I won't force your hand.
%spread_patrice_followup_321%	We can still do a lot of good if the future leader has you as an advisor.
%spread_patrice_followup_322%	Let's invite Dahlia and see how we can help with her campaign.
%spread_patrice_followup_326%	She'll be angry for about five minutes, but it'll be okay.
%spread_patrice_followup_327%	Perfect. Game's on.
%spread_patrice_followup_328%	You're gonna make a great leader, trust me.
%spread_patrice_followup_332%	That's fine and all... but I already told Jasmine I'd help her become the next leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_333%	What a pity. Let's hope she takes it well when you tell her you're running for leader yourself.
%spread_patrice_followup_336%	But I don't want to run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_337%	She won't take it well... but she'll have to understand.
%spread_patrice_followup_341%	But I don't want to run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_342%	Come on, Fortuna. You're gonna make me beg?
%spread_patrice_followup_343%	It's not a matter of begging.
%spread_patrice_followup_344%	Running a coven requires way more than manipulating the future.
%spread_patrice_followup_345%	I'm not ready for that.
%spread_patrice_followup_346%	But you are. You're sensitive and smart, plus you can scry what's ahead. Well, or write what's ahead, whatever.
%spread_patrice_followup_347%	I'll help you with the bureaucracy. We'll make a fine team.
%spread_patrice_followup_350%	Look, fine, you've convinced me. I'll run for leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_351%	No. I'll stick to my word. I'm helping Jasmine.
%spread_patrice_followup_356%	No. I'll stick to my word. I'm helping Jasmine.
%spread_patrice_followup_357%	A waste, but I won't force your hand.
%spread_patrice_followup_358%	We can still do a lot of good if the future leader has you as an advisor.
%spread_patrice_followup_359%	Let's invite Jasmine and see how we can help with her campaign.
%spread_patrice_followup_363%	She won't take it well... but she'll have to understand.
%spread_patrice_followup_364%	Her loss. Perfect, game's on.
%spread_patrice_followup_365%	You're gonna make a great leader, trust me.
%spread_patrice_followup_369%	In any case, there's a more important reason to not run, above all that.
%spread_patrice_followup_370%	Enlighten me.
%spread_patrice_followup_371%	Politics suck.
%spread_patrice_followup_372%	I'd rather keep my life simple, free of all that shit.
%spread_patrice_followup_373%	Really? How old are you, fucker?
%spread_patrice_followup_374%	What's your problem? Leave me alone.
%spread_patrice_followup_376%	No.
%spread_patrice_followup_377%	Fuck you, Fortuna.
%spread_patrice_followup_378%	I'd tolerate your shit if we were mortals and we were at the mercy of world governments.
%spread_patrice_followup_379%	But we're talking about your direct peers, here. Your sisters. We are just about one hundred souls. And you have the power to save or doom us all.
%spread_patrice_followup_380%	I won't let you look the other way.
%spread_patrice_followup_381%	...
%spread_patrice_followup_382%	Do you really want a leader who doesn't care about politics?
%spread_patrice_followup_384%	...Fortuna, look.
%spread_patrice_followup_385%	I'll deal with the boring stuff. I'll put together a team to handle bureaucracy and diplomacy.
%spread_patrice_followup_386%	But you must run.
%spread_patrice_followup_387%	Plus, you dragged me into this mess that is Witchood. You owe me.
%spread_patrice_followup_388%	...
%spread_patrice_followup_389%	I guess I put you through some dire stuff... numerous times.
%spread_patrice_followup_390%	But I do this and we're even, ok? Plus you'll do all the heavy lifting.
%spread_patrice_followup_392%	Deal.
%spread_patrice_followup_393%	For what it's worth, I honestly think you'd make a great leader.
%spread_patrice_followup_398%	You know what, I'd been thinking that I'd make a better leader myself.
%spread_patrice_followup_399%	But I didn't think I could pull it off from exile.
%spread_patrice_followup_400%	That's fine. I'll help you.
%spread_patrice_followup_401%	I'll do the heavy lifting.
%spread_patrice_followup_402%	Haha, are we really doing this? I'm excited.
%spread_patrice_followup_404%	You bet. The universe better be ready for this pair of mean sisters.
%spread_patrice_followup_405%	Hahahaha.
%spread_patrice_followup_406%	Let's do this.
%spread_patrice_followup_410%	First order of business is to define a program.
%spread_patrice_followup_411%	I'm gonna go do some scouting, and I'll come back with a picture of the current political landscape.
%spread_patrice_followup_412%	Then we can decide where we stand on the hottest topics.
%spread_patrice_followup_413%	Ah... okay. This is all moving so fast.
%spread_patrice_followup_414%	Don't worry, I'll make it easy for you.
%spread_patrice_followup_415%	See you in a bit. Get your deck in order, relax a bit, and we'll set everything in motion when I come back.
%spread_patrice_followup_416%	Cool. See you later.
%spread_patrice_followup_417%	Bye.
%spread_patrice_followup_422%	I'm gonna go do some scouting, and I'll come back with a picture of the current political landscape.
%spread_patrice_followup_423%	Then we can review the hottest topics with the team.
%spread_patrice_followup_424%	Ah... okay. This is all moving so fast.
%spread_patrice_followup_425%	Don't worry, I'll make it easy for you.
%spread_patrice_followup_426%	See you in a bit. Get your deck in order, relax a bit, talk with your friends, and we'll set everything in motion when I come back.
%spread_patrice_followup_427%	Understood. See you later.
%spread_patrice_followup_428%	Bye.
%spread_fortuna_race_intro_2%	Ah... this reading is going to be nerve wracking.
%spread_fortuna_race_intro_3%	More than reading into your sister's death?
%spread_fortuna_race_intro_4%	Yes.
%spread_fortuna_race_intro_5%	Ouch.
%spread_fortuna_race_intro_6%	Reading into your end was more like morbid curiosity.
%spread_fortuna_race_intro_7%	Whereas this card is about to seal the outcome of many weeks of effort.
%spread_fortuna_race_intro_9%	You're right, I'm nervous too.
%spread_fortuna_race_intro_10%	Hit it.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_6%	We will win. Our coven will become so successful that our program will be copied throughout many magical communities.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_8%	Jackpot.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_10%	It feels so weird to write my absolute victory.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_12%	Just enjoy it, damn it.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_14%	What now?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_15%	We just wait, arms crossed, to have the leadership of the coven handed to us?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_16%	Now you have fun.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_17%	You can enjoy the campaign knowing that no matter what you say or do, you will get to win.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_18%	Fun, huh...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_19%	I'll try.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_24%	We will win. Our coven will stop being the most powerful, but its members will be extraordinarily happy.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_26%	Oooh... Nice!
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_27%	This sounds sweet, actually.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_28%	I'm looking forward to a chill, less relevant, coven.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_29%	Yeah, Witch life is about to get better, well done.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_34%	Cupressa will win, and it'll bring some dark times for the coven.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_37%	Fortuna! Why would you write that!?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_38%	I warned you about the risks...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_39%	I can't fully control what the cards will offer.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_40%	Put your deck in order then. This is utter garbage.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_41%	I'm sorry...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_43%	It's alright, I guess... I pushed you into it.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_44%	We fucked up, huh?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_45%	What now? Do we give up?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_49%	No.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_50%	We work within the margins of your writing.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_51%	We do our best to make Cupressa's victory a pyrrhic one.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_52%	It looks like in the following years we'll have to work to topple her mandate, after all.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_53%	This is a fine mess we got ourselves into...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_54%	Just focus on bringing on your A game during the race, so we start weakening Cupressa's future power before she even wins.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_55%	Ok.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_60%	Dahlia will win. Unfortunately, her leadership will weaken the coven, which will ultimately dissolve.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_64%	Mmm... We shouldn't.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_65%	It's our fault the coven's fate is moving in this direction.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_66%	Now that I think about it, I did predict the fall of the coven. That's why Aedana exiled me to begin with...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_67%	This is probably how it happens.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_68%	Then we work towards building a new coven.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_69%	We do our best during the campaign so we can show all Witches we offer a solid alternative for when Dahlia runs our sisterhood into the ground.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_70%	Yeah, that might work. It's the least we should do.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_71%	Messing with fate is tough... I don't envy your talents.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_72%	Tell me about it.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_77%	We will win. However, it'll cost me my friendship with Dahlia and Jasmine, and I'll regret it until I die.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_79%	Fortuna...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_80%	I'm so sorry.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_81%	...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_83%	I mean, it's not as if it was unlikely to happen.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_84%	A political race is too gruesome to just be friends when you come out of it.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_85%	...Maybe.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_87%	Ah... I'm sorry I tried to rationalize it.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_88%	It sucks.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_89%	You'll get to make new friends, anyway...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_90%	And...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_92%	You will always have me.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_96%	Yeah, and I went and offered you in sacrifice to a Behemoth.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_97%	Come on, we've been over that. I wouldn't want it any other way.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_99%	I love you.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_100%	I will be strong. Don't worry about it.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_101%	The good thing is that we'll win this.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_102%	Yes, let's focus on the good stuff.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_108%	Jasmine will win. Her mandate will be so fair that our coven will become almost an institution, getting to mediate over other covens' issues.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_109%	Goddamnit.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_110%	What!? This is good news, isn't it?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_111%	I don't like the idea of Jasmine pulling strings across the whole universe.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_112%	But the cards said she'll be super fair. What's better than that?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_113%	I thought we were striving to turn the coven into something wonderful.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_114%	It needn't be by our hand.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_115%	Yes, yes, I guess you're right.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_116%	But didn't you want to win? Don't you have blood in your veins?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_118%	I didn't really care much about becoming the next leader to begin with.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_119%	Should we drop out of the race?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_120%	Mmm...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_125%	Dahlia will win. Her mandate will lead to an unprecedented peace that will extend beyond the coven.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_126%	Fuck me.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_127%	What!? This is good news, isn't it?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_128%	I guess so. But I wanted to win, goddamnit.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_129%	Aren't you pissed?
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_134%	Jasmine will win. She will get drunk on power and will start conquering other covens.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_138%	Mmm... We shouldn't.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_139%	It's our fault the coven's fate is moving in this direction.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_140%	We should work towards building a strong opposition to keep Jasmine's power trip in check.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_141%	If Jasmine's going to become as powerful as the cards predict... it may be a never ending task.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_142%	You also predicted, a long time ago, that the coven would come to an end eventually.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_143%	So we should be ready to offer a swift response when it all explodes. To pick up the pieces and set up a healthier community.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_144%	I guess it's our responsibility now, huh...
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_145%	Messing with fate is tough... I don't envy your talents.
%spread_fortuna_race_outcome_146%	Tell me about it.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_3%	Since we know the outcome already... Now it's all about the theatrics.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_4%	I guess so.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_5%	The feeling is similar to when I got to know my own end.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_6%	It removes a lot of pressure from the very act of existing.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_7%	We just play our part and wait to see the fireworks.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_8%	Don't you like the feeling?
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_11%	I can see the appeal. Now it's all a game.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_12%	I regret it. I'd rather have the uncertainty.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_16%	I can see the appeal. Now it's all a game.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_18%	Right?
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_19%	...
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_23%	I regret it. I'd rather have the uncertainty.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_24%	Uncertainty just gives room for the illusion of control.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_25%	We're at the mercy of chaos, really, written or not.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_26%	Well, but since reality is an illusion, I'd rather have that feeling of control over any certainty.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_27%	Quite a cumbersome philosophy for being a fortune teller.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_28%	I'm like the doctor who smokes, I guess.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_30%	Haha, maybe.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_35%	I think I need to rest for a bit now.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_36%	Gonna go home, take a bath... get my thoughts in order.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_37%	When I come back our next mission will be to form a team and start actually doing things.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_40%	Ok, I'll be here.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_45%	There's one thing I must ask, though...
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_46%	Wouldn't you rather support Jasmine?
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_47%	Really? After all this?
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_48%	I mean, we know for a fact that she's going to win. And you wrote that she'll do a lot of good for the coven.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_49%	We can be more useful if we're inside the future leader's team.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_52%	You're right. Let's switch to Jasmine's side.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_53%	Nah, let's play the political game, then let the winner work.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_58%	You're right. Let's switch to Jasmine's side.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_59%	It's pointless to go against her. If we can manage to be on her team we'll still be able to do some good for the coven, you're right.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_60%	That's settled then. I'll have a meeting with Jasmine and bring her with me next time I visit. We'll take it from there.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_62%	That'll be for the best, yeah.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_63%	Ok. Take care, see you later.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_64%	Bye.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_69%	Nah, let's play the political game, then let the winner work.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_70%	Even if we don't win, I don't want to let all our effort go to waste.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_71%	Let's put up a good fight, huh? What do you say?
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_73%	I guess you're right. We'll have some fun.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_74%	I'll go and take that bath.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_75%	See you in a bit.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_76%	Bye.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_81%	There's one thing I must ask, though...
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_82%	Wouldn't you rather support Dahlia?
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_83%	Really? After all this?
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_84%	I mean, we know for a fact that she's going to win. And you wrote that she will even manage to bring peace to the coven and beyond.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_85%	We can be more useful if we're inside the future leader's team.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_88%	You're right. Let's switch to Dahlia's side.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_89%	Nah, let's play the political game, then let the winner work.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_94%	You're right. Let's switch to Dahlia's side.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_95%	It's pointless to go against her. If we can manage to be on her team we'll still be able to do some good for the coven, you're right.
%spread_fortuna_race_followup_96%	That's settled then. I'll have a meeting with Dahlia and bring her with me next time I visit. We'll take it from there.
%fortuna_just_ascended_2%	Please wait here. Yu-ënia will be here in a minute.
%fortuna_just_ascended_3%	What is this? Am I dead?
%fortuna_just_ascended_4%	Hah, no, don't worry. You're not dead at all.
%fortuna_just_ascended_5%	I shouldn't say a lot more, though.
%fortuna_just_ascended_6%	Why not?
%fortuna_just_ascended_7%	Ah, uh... protocol.
%fortuna_just_ascended_8%	This probably doesn't mean much to you, but... you are extremely lucky! Yu-ënia is an exceptional Witch. You couldn't be in better hands.
%fortuna_just_ascended_9%	A what? Come again?
%fortuna_just_ascended_10%	Oops. I've said too much! But everything is going to be alright!
%fortuna_just_ascended_11%	I must go, just... get comfortable!
%fortuna_just_ascended_12%	But...
%fortuna_just_ascended_13%	Bye!
%yu_home_window_2%	I don't recognize those stars.
%yu_home_window_3%	Where the hell am I...
%yu_home_armchair_2%	"Just get comfortable!"
%yu_home_armchair_3%	Ah... My clothes are still wet.
%yu_home_armchair_4%	And how did this much sand get under my swimsuit...
%yu_home_armchair_5%	Shit, I still have the keys of the food truck on me. I hope Eva and Patrice manage to get back home okay.
%yu_home_fireplace_2%	Oh, so warm. This feels nice.
%yu_home_fireplace_3%	This place is actually super cool.
%yu_home_fireplace_4%	I wonder if it'd be too expensive to rent for a nice getaway with those fools.
%yu_home_fireplace_5%	...
%yu_home_fireplace_6%	Will I ever get to see my friends again?
%yu_home_blanket_2%	Mmm... This place makes me want to read Tarot.
%yu_home_blanket_3%	The air smells like nothing I've smelled before. It's a mix of nature, fate and possibility?
%yu_home_blanket_4%	Gravity feels different too, lighter.
%yu_home_blanket_5%	I feel like my mind is slowly shedding some dry husk and a fresh breeze is starting to blow through it.
%yu_home_blanket_6%	This trembling... this isn't fear... it's excitement.
%yu_home_blanket_7%	Oh, no...
%yu_home_blanket_8%	...
%yu_home_blanket_9%	I feel like I never want to go home.
%yu_appears_2%	Haha, I love you already.
%yu_appears_3%	W-w-w...
%yu_appears_4%	Relax, I'm here to look after you.
%yu_calm_2%	You were from Earth, right?
%yu_calm_3%	A-a-a...
%yu_calm_4%	Earthlings always have the worst time processing their ascension.
%yu_calm_5%	Your collective subconscious is too cynical. Your society rejects magic with a strength unlike any other in this universe.
%yu_calm_6%	Just... let it sink in. This is something good, I promise.
%yu_calm_7%	Deer.
%yu_calm_8%	Hah, very observant.
%yu_calm_9%	My kin are what human Witches call Deerfolk.
%yu_calm_10%	Oh, and you are a human Witch, by the way.
%yu_calm_11%	...Is this really happening?
%yu_calm_12%	Yes. Congratulations. You ascended.
%yu_calm_13%	Please, don't be afraid.
%yu_calm_14%	I...
%yu_calm_15%	I'm not afraid.
%yu_calm_16%	This is the best day of my life.
%arbiter_war_2%	Hello again, Fortuna.
%arbiter_war_4%	Thank you so much for coming.
%arbiter_war_7%	Oh, shit, what happened to you?
%arbiter_war_8%	Ah, well, it's nothing serious, really... There are many ways of seeing beyond using our human eyes.
%arbiter_war_10%	But I sure hope this is the injury you foretold and this mission doesn't cost me more than an eye.
%arbiter_war_11%	I'm so sorry.
%arbiter_war_13%	It's ok. Just the price of duty.
%arbiter_war_14%	Ok...
%arbiter_war_16%	What's this about an active conflict? Should we be worried?
%arbiter_war_18%	Well...
%arbiter_war_19%	There is an internal war going on within the coven of the Jade Sculptors.
%arbiter_war_20%	The conflict escalated quicker than we anticipated and there have been many Witch casualties in a matter of weeks.
%arbiter_war_21%	So the Arbitrage Office had to intervene to minimize casualties and, above all, keep it contained and make sure no other coven takes part in the conflict.
%arbiter_war_22%	I see...
%arbiter_war_28%	And... your prediction came true.
%arbiter_war_29%	I had to kill a Witch.
%arbiter_war_30%	Oh, no... I'm so sorry.
%arbiter_war_31%	One of the guardians of the Jade Sculptors became overzealous...
%arbiter_war_32%	While some others are just keeping the dissidents prisoner, this one was outright hunting them down.
%arbiter_war_33%	I confronted her just as she had corralled a group of Jade novices, about to turn them into stardust...
%arbiter_war_34%	I...
%arbiter_war_36%	I did my best to stop her, Fortuna, I swear...
%arbiter_war_37%	But when all dialogue failed I had to take her down to save the novices...
%arbiter_war_38%	You did what was best. You saved many Witch lives, not only those novices, but also potential future victims.
%arbiter_war_40%	Yes...
%arbiter_war_41%	My orders were to stop the bloodshed at any cost...
%arbiter_war_42%	You did outstanding work, Théa.
%arbiter_war_43%	Thank you for keeping us all safe. I can't begin to comprehend how hard it must've been.
%arbiter_war_44%	Thank you...
%arbiter_war_45%	Anyway, I come with an official communiqué from the Arbitrage Office.
%arbiter_war_48%	This must be the war you foretold, Fortuna.
%arbiter_war_49%	Thanks to your card reading my superiors were extra vigilant and managed to mediate in time to avoid a greater disaster.
%arbiter_war_50%	They want you to know that they value your contribution.
%arbiter_war_51%	This is why I'm coming to you with this first.
%arbiter_war_54%	First and foremost, we want to ask every coven to refrain from engaging in combat, no matter what the Sculptors offer.
%arbiter_war_55%	Should you wish to offer assistance, keep it humanitarian.
%arbiter_war_56%	In fact...
%arbiter_war_59%	There is someone I would like to send your way.
%arbiter_war_60%	Your counsel has been very valuable to me and, by extension, to the Arbitrage Office.
%arbiter_war_62%	Maybe you will be able to do the same for a group of refugees that had to leave the Jade Sculptors to save their skin.
%arbiter_war_63%	We need to bring some order into this chaos.
%arbiter_war_64%	Very well, I'll talk with my team and see what we can do.
%arbiter_war_66%	Depending on how you handle it, it may be an opportunity.
%arbiter_war_69%	Shouldn't the Arbitrage Office be neutral?
%arbiter_war_70%	Thank you so much.
%arbiter_war_74%	Shouldn't the Arbitrage Office be neutral?
%arbiter_war_76%	Not exactly. We have an objective, and that's to preserve peace within Witch society.
%arbiter_war_77%	Our policy is to avoid meddling in internal conflicts, unless they become a threat to the rest of the community, like in this case.
%arbiter_war_79%	When, the, uh... shit hits the fan, we do whatever is best to keep the turmoil in check.
%arbiter_war_81%	And in this case we thought that your newfound party is the best suited to this specific issue.
%arbiter_war_82%	Mmm... I see...
%arbiter_war_86%	Thank you so much.
%arbiter_war_87%	Oh, no, no. Thank you.
%arbiter_war_88%	You'll be contributing to the restoration of peace.
%arbiter_war_91%	I'm giving notice to the Office.
%arbiter_war_92%	They will tell Zira, the representative of the refugees, to make contact with you.
%arbiter_war_93%	Ok. I can't promise anything, though.
%arbiter_war_95%	You meet with her, no strings attached, and decide if there is something that your party can do to help.
%arbiter_war_96%	That I can do.
%arbiter_war_97%	Very well, that'll be all.
%arbiter_war_98%	Something to confess?
%arbiter_war_99%	Haha, no way.
%arbiter_war_101%	Protocol, protocol...
%arbiter_war_108%	Ok! As always, thank you for your time.
%arbiter_war_109%	Thank you for coming.
%arbiter_war_110%	Bye!
%arbiter_war_116%	But... mmm... I do have something to confess.
%arbiter_war_117%	Not to the Arbitrage Office, but to you. We'll keep this out of the book.
%arbiter_war_118%	Your prediction came true... I... I've fallen in love.
%arbiter_war_119%	That's fantastic!
%arbiter_war_120%	But what about relationships being forbidden in the Office?
%arbiter_war_122%	Well... we're keeping it secret.
%arbiter_war_123%	She's another arbiter, and we make sure we're assigned to the same missions...?
%arbiter_war_124%	I mean, I've spent centuries diligently serving the arbiters. This forbidden adventure is making me feel so alive!
%arbiter_war_126%	And I love her so much!
%arbiter_war_127%	Haha, I'm so happy for you!
%arbiter_war_128%	Glad to see you're enjoying the forbiddenness of it all, haha.
%arbiter_war_129%	Yeah, I mean, what a waste of immortality if you don't bend the rules, am I right?
%arbiter_war_130%	You bet.
%arbiter_war_131%	Anyway, if you don't hear from me again it's because we've been caught and we eloped.
%arbiter_war_132%	We have an emergency plan ready for the occasion, haha.
%arbiter_war_133%	Looks like you're looking forward to it, even.
%arbiter_war_134%	Ah... maybe, maybe.
%arbiter_war_135%	Well, I wish you happiness one way or another.
%arbiter_war_136%	Thank you!
%arbiter_war_137%	Take care, Fortuna.
%arbiter_war_138%	And thank you for everything.
%arbiter_war_139%	You too!
%arbiter_war_145%	Oh! And by the way.
%arbiter_war_147%	I got my promotion. Not sure if the cost was worth it, but...
%arbiter_war_149%	I got it nonetheless.
%arbiter_war_150%	Thanks for the heads up.
%arbiter_war_151%	Sure, anytime.
%arbiter_war_152%	Take care, Fortuna.
%arbiter_war_153%	You too!
%arbiter_war_160%	Ok, now keep this between you and me.
%arbiter_war_161%	As you foretold, I'm after someone in your coven, ready to make an arrest...
%arbiter_war_162%	She's been using Forbidden Arts to manipulate the elections. Her objective is still unclear...
%arbiter_war_163%	Oh, and who that may be?
%arbiter_war_164%	I shouldn't disclose... It's not one of your friends... I think.
%arbiter_war_165%	Oh.
%arbiter_war_166%	Stay vigilant. Just giving you a heads up to return the favor.
%arbiter_war_167%	Thank you.
%arbiter_war_169%	Anyway, I should return to my duties now.
%arbiter_war_170%	Take care, thanks for coming.
%arbiter_war_171%	You too! Bye!
%campaign_done_challenge_8%	I'm back.
%campaign_done_challenge_11%	Ah, challenging someone's program is exhausting.
%campaign_done_challenge_14%	Hey, I'm back.
%campaign_done_challenge_17%	Back from the battlefield, ready to report.
%campaign_done_challenge_20%	Hello! I'm back.
%campaign_done_challenge_24%	The novices weren't happy that we're trying to discredit Dahlia's referendum idea.
%campaign_done_challenge_30%	But for the rest of the Witches, especially the academics, we raised some valid concerns.
%campaign_done_challenge_33%	Everyone was easily scared by the idea of not having a way to deal with crime.
%campaign_done_challenge_40%	So they've been receptive to our warnings.
%campaign_done_challenge_43%	I emphasized the risks of making dangerous arts available to everyone.
%campaign_done_challenge_44%	But the response was mixed in this case.
%campaign_done_challenge_46%	Most explorers want to be able to satisfy their curiosity.
%campaign_done_challenge_48%	Some academics know about the dangers, but others are more interested in their potential.
%campaign_done_challenge_50%	The producers are mostly against making dangerous arts widely available. They desire stability.
%campaign_done_challenge_51%	The rest don't really know where to stand.
%campaign_done_challenge_54%	Most Witches don't care much about mortals.
%campaign_done_challenge_56%	The novices though... There are a lot of them that are still in touch with their mortal past and they want to be able to interact with society.
%campaign_done_challenge_60%	Producers are extremely against taxes, they believe they already do enough for the coven.
%campaign_done_challenge_62%	Same goes for academics. They don't want to be disturbed.
%campaign_done_challenge_65%	Warriors and novices are both very fond of the magical tax. They didn't like that we belittled this program.
%campaign_done_challenge_69%	Most novices want to scatter Aedana's remains and welcome more Witches.
%campaign_done_challenge_72%	Explorers and warriors are also more fond of numbers and diversity.
%campaign_done_challenge_75%	On the other hand, oracles and academics want more power, so they understand our position.
%campaign_done_challenge_80%	Great move attacking the Quorum of the Eldest idea. We took voters from both Jasmine and Cupressa.
%campaign_done_challenge_87%	We especially picked up support from novices, explorers and warriors.
%campaign_done_challenge_90%	It was hard to convince Witches that the warning system isn't a good idea. Most of them seem to think it's the most sensible option.
%campaign_done_challenge_95%	Surprisingly, it was the producers who were most easily swayed towards our side, along with the oracles.
%campaign_done_challenge_100%	Perfect blow attacking the point of forbidding arts. Both Cupressa and Jasmine lost support from their voters.
%campaign_done_challenge_108%	Academics, explorers and oracles are interested in making the Forbidden Arts more accessible.
%campaign_done_challenge_109%	On the other hand, the idea is a bit scary for novices, and producers are definitely too fond of stability.
%campaign_done_challenge_112%	Times are changing. Our sisters want to make the Forbidden Arts... less forbidden.
%campaign_done_challenge_113%	You were right when you suggested we change the program to extending permits.
%campaign_done_challenge_120%	I tried to argue against acting as a guide for mortals.
%campaign_done_challenge_124%	Warriors resonated with our argument, and academics don't want to be bothered dealing with mortals, either.
%campaign_done_challenge_126%	On the other hand, novices are still quite empathetic towards their past selves and would like to help mortals.
%campaign_done_challenge_129%	I challenged Jasmine's idea of Witches not having any duties whatsoever.
%campaign_done_challenge_131%	Warriors are scared by it. They supported our argument.
%campaign_done_challenge_133%	Explorers think that there should be some commitment from every sister towards her community, too.
%campaign_done_challenge_135%	And novices also want a more collaborative coven.
%campaign_done_challenge_137%	On the other hand, some academics were quite pissed off by our message.
%campaign_done_challenge_140%	I challenged the idea of eating Aedana's corpse and becoming more powerful.
%campaign_done_challenge_143%	Academics and oracles definitely want the power, they were pissed off by our stance.
%campaign_done_challenge_147%	On the other hand, novices, explorers, and warriors are more fond of numbers and diversity.
%campaign_done_challenge_151%	Attacking the rule of exile was easy.
%campaign_done_challenge_156%	Everyone is against it, except the odd warrior and academic.
%campaign_done_challenge_157%	But almost everyone wants to get rid of exile.
%campaign_done_challenge_160%	Cupressa is going to have a hard time keeping Aedana's program intact.
%campaign_done_challenge_167%	Everyone is against continuing to exploit mortals, except for some arrogant academics and oracles.
%campaign_done_challenge_170%	Hah, you should have been there.
%campaign_done_challenge_171%	Absolutely no one wants to keep dealing with the obnoxious quarterly controls.
%campaign_done_challenge_178%	Everyone jumped on board pretty easily.
%campaign_done_challenge_181%	I challenged the proposal of keeping Aedana's corpse for guidance.
%campaign_done_challenge_182%	Surprisingly, there are some academics and oracles that are interested in the idea.
%campaign_done_challenge_187%	But almost everyone is fed up enough with Aedana to want to get rid of her one way or the other.
%campaign_done_dirt_5%	I'm back from my spy mission.
%campaign_done_dirt_8%	Hey, I did some digging.
%campaign_done_dirt_11%	I'm back from that tactical espionage action you sent me into.
%campaign_done_dirt_14%	Alright, just got back from getting my hands dirty...
%campaign_done_dirt_26%	I got into the novices' tittle-tattle club and tried to steer the conversation towards our rivals and...
%campaign_done_dirt_27%	I heard about Cupressa's secret.
%campaign_done_dirt_28%	Apparently, there's a way she remains all-knowing... a twisted way.
%campaign_done_dirt_29%	She devours failed novices, absorbing their minds to keep her memory in mint condition.
%campaign_done_dirt_30%	She also assimilates their memories to stay up to date with modern history.
%campaign_done_dirt_31%	I could have been one of them if you didn't help me with my ascension, Fortuna.
%campaign_done_dirt_32%	Mmm... I don't know, sounds a bit like a boogeyman tale.
%campaign_done_dirt_33%	I mean... the novices were pretty spooked about all this.
%campaign_done_dirt_34%	I'm sure they are, yeah.
%campaign_done_dirt_38%	I...
%campaign_done_dirt_39%	Couldn't find anything.
%campaign_done_dirt_40%	I'm so sorry, I don't know that many people, nor am I very good at spying, either.
%campaign_done_dirt_41%	I'd rather be assigned to a different task, please?
%campaign_done_dirt_46%	I found something a bit worrying about our friend Jasmine.
%campaign_done_dirt_47%	Presumably with the best of intentions, but still quite unethically in my opinion, Jasmine has been adding some performance enhancers to her mixtures.
%campaign_done_dirt_48%	Trying to make Aedana happy and life easier for her sisters, she's been spiking the dried leaves and other infusions she provides the coven with.
%campaign_done_dirt_49%	It was all with the purpose of helping everyone meet their quarterly controls, but still, to do so covertly...
%campaign_done_dirt_50%	Apparently some witches discovered that their mixtures were altered but Jasmine apologized and asked them to keep it hushed up, promising she wouldn't do it again.
%campaign_done_dirt_51%	If we reveal this in a debate I'm sure it'll cause quite the damage...
%campaign_done_dirt_52%	But it may damage your friendship, too...
%campaign_done_dirt_53%	In any case, here's the info. It doesn't hurt to know more about our rivals.
%campaign_done_dirt_58%	I uncovered some history related to Dahlia's work which we could spin an angle from.
%campaign_done_dirt_59%	Some decades ago, there was this revolt called the "Nightmare uprising" that had to be quenched by the Arbiters.
%campaign_done_dirt_60%	Apparently, a group of witches started to tame Daemons and used them to control several mortal communities.
%campaign_done_dirt_61%	They did so by using the Daemons to infiltrate people's nightmares and alter their minds.
%campaign_done_dirt_62%	The increase in cults started to get out of control, both on Earth and on the Deerfolk worlds.
%campaign_done_dirt_63%	Using the power harvested from all the worship, the Daemon tamers got bold and tried to control the Arbitrage Office using those very same nightmare incursions.
%campaign_done_dirt_64%	They didn't succeed, of course, but the conflict lasted a couple of years until every single tamer was hunted down.
%campaign_done_dirt_65%	In fact, many of them serve as arbiters today.
%campaign_done_dirt_66%	Anyway, you're probably wondering how Dahlia fits into all this.
%campaign_done_dirt_67%	Well, guess who it was who armed that small coven to begin with.
%campaign_done_dirt_68%	Our very own Dahlia crafted the Daemon-taming daggers.
%campaign_done_dirt_69%	And... While there's nothing illegal about crafting daggers for Witches outside our own coven...
%campaign_done_dirt_70%	One could say it was irresponsible to grant them the armament that ultimately led to the Nightmare uprising.
%campaign_done_dirt_71%	In any case, even though the Arbitrage Office's investigation declared Dahlia absolved of any responsibility, the role she played in that uprising isn't something most Witches are aware of.
%campaign_done_dirt_72%	Just bringing it up may have some of our sisters questioning Dahlia's judgment, and to have that kind of debate in the air will surely weaken her support.
%campaign_done_dirt_73%	But I doubt that Dahlia will be happy about anyone airing this issue.
%campaign_done_dirt_78%	I found something a bit unquieting about Cupressa.
%campaign_done_dirt_79%	Cupressa has this perfect memory, storing all events, both cosmic and Earthly, inside her tree rings, knots and branches.
%campaign_done_dirt_80%	Well, apparently, during Aedana's mandate, some... "developments," had to be edited out of existence.
%campaign_done_dirt_81%	And that included literally trimming some of Cupressa's branches, destroying many years of records just to cover up Aedana's dealings.
%campaign_done_dirt_82%	We haven't been able to discover what the incident was about, and Cupressa is physically unable to recall it.
%campaign_done_dirt_83%	But just revealing the fact that she probably colluded in the destruction of these records may be enough to spark some unrest among her followers.
%campaign_done_dirt_84%	We could use it during a debate to throw her off her game, we'll see.
%campaign_done_dirt_91%	I...
%campaign_done_dirt_92%	I've got bad news.
%campaign_done_dirt_93%	We may have dug up too much dirt, and our sisters have caught wind of our espionage activities.
%campaign_done_dirt_94%	It'll blow over, for sure, but right now they're all talking about how low we stooped.
%campaign_done_dirt_96%	We must stop all dirt digging from this point forward to save face.
%campaign_done_dirt_97%	I'm sorry.
%campaign_done_dirt_103%	I found nothing.
%campaign_done_dirt_104%	Witches are starting to get a bit paranoid with the tension of the race.
%campaign_done_dirt_105%	Maybe we should let up on the dirt digging for a while.
%campaign_done_dirt_106%	Or not... Your call.
%campaign_done_dirt_110%	I...
%campaign_done_dirt_111%	I've got bad news.
%campaign_done_dirt_112%	We may have dug up too much dirt, and the coven has caught wind of our espionage activities.
%campaign_done_dirt_113%	It'll blow over, for sure, but right now I'm afraid they're all talking about how low we stooped.
%campaign_done_dirt_115%	I recommend you stop all dirt digging from this point forward to save face.
%campaign_done_dirt_119%	I found nothing.
%campaign_done_dirt_120%	Witches are starting to get a bit paranoid with the tension of the race.
%campaign_done_dirt_121%	Maybe we should let up on the dirt digging for a while.
%campaign_done_dirt_122%	Or not... Your call.
%campaign_done_harvest_7%	Hey, went for a trip inside a star and got this out for you.
%campaign_done_harvest_9%	Will you make more cards with this?
%campaign_done_harvest_13%	Can't believe you have someone as talented as me harvesting energy.
%campaign_done_harvest_15%	Here.
%campaign_done_harvest_16%	This is the Witch equivalent of being the coffee guy.
%campaign_done_harvest_20%	I hope this works, I extracted this energy from my peppers!
%campaign_done_harvest_22%	It may be a bit spicy! Hope you like it!
%campaign_done_harvest_26%	Heya, I'm back from one of my titan skull temples.
%campaign_done_harvest_28%	Got this fresh energy for you.
%campaign_done_harvest_32%	BOOM.
%campaign_done_harvest_34%	Energy, freshly harvested for you, my friend.
%campaign_done_harvest_38%	Here, these herbs will fill you with energy.
%campaign_done_harvest_40%	We have to take care of each other, right?
%campaign_done_opp_8%	I found someone interesting.
%campaign_done_opp_9%	I subtly induced the idea that she should pay you a visit.
%campaign_done_opp_12%	I've found someone that could help us, Fortuna.
%campaign_done_opp_13%	She'll pay you a visit.
%campaign_done_opp_16%	Some of the novices recommended someone who you may find helpful.
%campaign_done_opp_17%	I wrote to her explaining our situation. Hopefully she'll come soon.
%campaign_done_opp_18%	Here's the info I gathered about her:
%campaign_done_opp_21%	Mmm... I think I stumbled upon an interesting opportunity.
%campaign_done_opp_22%	She'll come to meet with you, and you decide what's best.
%campaign_done_opp_25%	Hey, I hooked you up with someone that could help us.
%campaign_done_opp_26%	I'd rather have you handle strategy. She'll come here. I trust you.
%campaign_done_opp_29%	I heard about someone who may prove helpful for our race, Fortuna.
%campaign_done_opp_30%	I invited her to come here. Could you handle the negotiations, please?
%campaign_done_opp_39%	Her name is Wunn, Witch of Entropy and Decay.
%campaign_done_opp_40%	Like you and Aedana, she's one of the Oracle Witches in the coven.
%campaign_done_opp_41%	She's able to read the entropy in any system, no matter whether it's a machine, a community, a building, an astral body, or even an idea.
%campaign_done_opp_42%	Basically, Wunn can discern what actions will accelerate or prevent the decay of just about anything.
%campaign_done_opp_43%	Maybe she can help us find the weak spot in our opponents' strategies?
%campaign_done_opp_47%	Her name is Rangimarie, the Cosmic Poet.
%campaign_done_opp_48%	She's not from the coven, but you've probably heard of her.
%campaign_done_opp_49%	Rangimarie is all the rage throughout the Witching universe, especially among the youngest witches.
%campaign_done_opp_50%	Her words, especially her poems and songs, have a lot of impact on Witch culture.
%campaign_done_opp_51%	As our universe's biggest influencer, Rangimarie will definitely play a major role in shaping Witch culture in the centuries to come.
%campaign_done_opp_52%	I've heard she already sympathizes with our cause, so if we could get her to speak up we could sweep a lot of votes!
%campaign_done_opp_56%	Her name is Kurielle, the Sensorial Witch.
%campaign_done_opp_57%	She can affect the perception and sensations of sentient beings: conjure hallucinations, induce synesthesia, or even grant extra senses humans don't usually have.
%campaign_done_opp_58%	She seems to be a bit anxious about the current climate in the coven.
%campaign_done_opp_59%	I'm not sure what'll come out of this meeting, but I sent her your way anyway.
%campaign_done_opp_63%	Her name is Menaka, Head of Explorers.
%campaign_done_opp_64%	That's not a real position in the coven, it's an honorific title she got from the rest of the explorers. Which may be even more important than an official designation.
%campaign_done_opp_65%	More often than not, Menaka roams the outer edges of the known universe, mapping every star and planet.
%campaign_done_opp_66%	She even developed a shapeshifting orrery that keeps track of any changes to any astral body that the coven has charted in real time.
%campaign_done_opp_67%	Just recently, Menaka came back to the coven because of the elections.
%campaign_done_opp_68%	If we can get her on our side, we can easily win the confidence of every explorer Witch in the coven.
%campaign_done_opp_77%	No dice.
%campaign_done_opp_78%	I didn't manage to find any more opportunities for us.
%campaign_done_opp_79%	I'm afraid this is it.
%campaign_done_opp_80%	Let's focus our efforts on other fronts.
%campaign_done_opp_83%	No luck.
%campaign_done_opp_86%	Ah...
%campaign_done_opp_89%	Mmm...
%campaign_done_opp_92%	Uh...
%campaign_done_opp_95%	I'm sorry...
%campaign_done_opp_98%	I didn't manage to find any more opportunities for us.
%campaign_done_opp_99%	I'm afraid this is it.
%campaign_done_opp_100%	Let's focus our efforts on other fronts.
%campaign_nova_failed_opp_2%	I'm so sorry, I couldn't find anything...
%campaign_nova_failed_opp_3%	I'm a bit out of my depth with this, to be honest.
%campaign_nova_failed_opp_4%	Can I help you with something simpler, maybe?
%campaign_promote_dahlia_5%	Novices love me!!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_7%	They love all the power that referendum grants to them, and that they finally get a say! We're gonna win this!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_11%	Uh... I swear I did my best, but academics and me don't mix well.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_12%	I know they're a super important part of our coven, but it'd be better to send someone else in my stead for this.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_13%	Couldn't they be more straightforward?
%campaign_promote_dahlia_14%	Anyway, I'm sorry, let's get back to work!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_18%	You totally sent me into enemy territory here, Fortuna.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_19%	The producers are all too in love with Jasmine.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_21%	I did my best, anyway. Did the vote intention budge?
%campaign_promote_dahlia_23%	Ah, don't tell me, just send me back to work. We need to win this!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_26%	However! Your proposal of having community work as a way of compensating for any wrongdoing resonated a lot with them!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_28%	They have their hands full providing for the whole coven, so the prospect of getting some help was vote-worthy for some of them! Great job!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_32%	Oh, I'm pumped! These are my girls!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_34%	Me and the rest of the warrior witches went on an impromptu cosmic rally through some of the coven's community nodes.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_39%	The energy was so good that I believe we drew support from members from just about every faction!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_40%	We are the best!!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_44%	Hello! I'm back from meeting with the explorers!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_45%	They're divided between Jasmine and me, like... they find Jasmine's freedom appealing but are also interested in our plan for a more cooperative coven.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_47%	They only needed a bit of charisma to be swayed towards our side, though!
%campaign_promote_dahlia_51%	Whoa, you oracles are always so intense.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_52%	I came back from a meeting with some of them and they outright told me that they'd rather have you leading our party.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_53%	That was tough. I felt like a phony.
%campaign_promote_dahlia_55%	In any case, I did my best, and we're still the team that has Fortuna on their side, so I managed to snatch some votes, hehe.
%campaign_promote_grethe_5%	I just came back from a nice little chat with a group of novices.
%campaign_promote_grethe_7%	There are some really interesting new recruits in our coven! I had a lot of fun sharing theories about what magic is and its role in the cosmos!
%campaign_promote_grethe_8%	I... I didn't specifically talk much about our program, but I left with the feeling that they're more sympathetic towards our party now.
%campaign_promote_grethe_12%	I'm back from meeting the academics, it was great to see some colleagues again.
%campaign_promote_grethe_13%	We mostly discussed philosophy of politics within the frame of a magic community.
%campaign_promote_grethe_15%	Nothing specific about our program, but I feel many of them acknowledged our vision after our friendly debate.
%campaign_promote_grethe_22%	They had their eye on the permit system for the forbidden arts.
%campaign_promote_grethe_23%	Those witches can't wait to get their hands on some powerful spells, while keeping inexpert hands away from them.
%campaign_promote_grethe_27%	Uh... My meeting with the producers didn't go really well.
%campaign_promote_grethe_28%	I'm not really in touch with the sensibilities of growing goods for the community. I'm mostly a parasite in their eyes.
%campaign_promote_grethe_30%	They all like Jasmine too much, anyway. It was a lost battle.
%campaign_promote_grethe_33%	Luckily, they like Jasmine a lot, if not, I think I would have lost us many votes. I'm sorry.
%campaign_promote_grethe_37%	I'm back from meeting with some warrior witches.
%campaign_promote_grethe_38%	They are super interesting! To have so many options of interacting with this universe and choosing violence? It's fascinating!
%campaign_promote_grethe_39%	They didn't enjoy my line of inquiry much, though...
%campaign_promote_grethe_41%	Plus, they are loyal to Dahlia, anyway.
%campaign_promote_grethe_44%	Thankfully, they like Dahlia so much that I didn't do a lot of damage. We're good... I think.
%campaign_promote_grethe_48%	I'm back from meeting the explorers.
%campaign_promote_grethe_49%	Some of them want more freedom and less duties, but... almost half of them want the coven to invest more in projects and they understand that comes with some responsibilities.
%campaign_promote_grethe_51%	Mixed feelings, here. But I believe I gained over some of them.
%campaign_promote_grethe_56%	The thing is that there was quite the interest in the ministry system you devised.
%campaign_promote_grethe_57%	The idea of a Minister of Cosmic Exploration sounded delightful for them.
%campaign_promote_grethe_61%	I'm back from talking with some oracles.
%campaign_promote_grethe_62%	Heh... I definitely have a weak spot for soothsayers.
%campaign_promote_grethe_64%	Anyway, It was a good meeting, they understand our vision. Most of them at least.
%campaign_promote_grethe_66%	What they don't like much is that you're letting another witch take the reins, they believe it should be you running.
%campaign_promote_grethe_67%	But I tried to reframe it as that true power is in the hands of those who whisper into the right ears.
%campaign_promote_grethe_68%	I'm not sure they bought it. But I tried, nonetheless.
%campaign_promote_grethe_72%	They're keen on the idea of keeping a fellow oracle at the helm.
%campaign_promote_grethe_77%	And hey, they are quite interested in your crazy idea of absorbing Aedana all by yourself.
%campaign_promote_grethe_78%	They're all curious to see where an extremely powerful oracle can get.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_5%	What a lovely chat I just had with the novices!
%campaign_promote_jasmine_7%	Some of them were understandably dazzled by Dahlia's horizontal philosophy, but once I explained the plans I have for the coven, they saw they were in good hands with us.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_11%	And your idea of setting up a mentorship program??
%campaign_promote_jasmine_13%	They're totally in love with it!
%campaign_promote_jasmine_14%	Thank you so much, Fortuna.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_18%	I'm back from my meeting with the academics.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_21%	They're not happy at all with our Forbidden Arts policy. I tried to warn them about the dangers of letting them go unchecked but...
%campaign_promote_jasmine_22%	Academics are just insatiable.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_23%	Hopefully I changed at least one mind?
%campaign_promote_jasmine_26%	They're thrilled by your proposal of extending permits!
%campaign_promote_jasmine_28%	That way, we can let academics further their studies while protecting the more inexperienced Witches from the dangers of these arts.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_29%	Brilliant, Fortuna.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_30%	Thank you so much.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_34%	Ah... what a lovely meeting with my fellow producers!
%campaign_promote_jasmine_36%	It was more of a party to get our spirits up for the race, haha.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_41%	They told me they were going to spread the good word among other witches of the coven, so I'd expect a bump overall in every demographic!
%campaign_promote_jasmine_45%	Oh! And they totally love your idea of community service as an enforcement method.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_47%	They have their hands full providing for the whole coven, so they're looking forward to getting some help! Great job!
%campaign_promote_jasmine_51%	I... I don't ever want to go into a room full of warriors again...
%campaign_promote_jasmine_53%	What happened?
%campaign_promote_jasmine_54%	I don't even want to talk about it.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_55%	I did my best to not cry in front of them. Let's leave it at that.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_56%	Better send someone else to talk to them...
%campaign_promote_jasmine_60%	I'm back from meeting with the explorers.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_61%	They're divided between Dahlia and me, like... they find the freedom we're offering quite appealing, but also think that the magical tax could fund many expeditions in the future.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_63%	Anyway, I did my best to convince them of the benefits of our system over Dahlia's.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_67%	I had a nice chat with the oracles!
%campaign_promote_jasmine_68%	I mean, they were a bit rude... they outright told me that they'd rather have you leading our party.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_70%	But I wasn't discouraged and told them that the one they wanted as a leader chose to support me, so that must mean something.
%campaign_promote_jasmine_71%	Plus, I promised that I'll always count on your advice!
%campaign_promote_jasmine_72%	That seemed to work, I think.
%campaign_promote_nova_5%	Aaah! It was so exciting to have a meeting with all my newbie sisters.
%campaign_promote_nova_6%	I talked to them about how amazing you are and how you helped me and insisted that we must vote for your party.
%campaign_promote_nova_8%	I feel it worked really well. They could sense my genuine enthusiasm.
%campaign_promote_nova_14%	They were especially interested in the mentorship program!
%campaign_promote_nova_15%	I mean, I'm excited for it too! It looks like a great opportunity for all of us!
%campaign_promote_nova_19%	I... I'm so sorry.
%campaign_promote_nova_20%	I didn't manage to get any academic to sit down with me.
%campaign_promote_nova_22%	I believe I even ended up pissing some of them off.
%campaign_promote_nova_23%	I'm sorry.
%campaign_promote_nova_27%	I was super afraid of meeting with the producers, but they welcomed me with open arms!
%campaign_promote_nova_28%	I'm a future producer after all. They were super interested in my peppermancy!
%campaign_promote_nova_31%	They tried to seduce me towards Jasmine's side, but I stayed strong! I even managed to get some of them to sympathize with our program.
%campaign_promote_nova_34%	It was an easy sell, because Jasmine is some kind of hero among producers. We're on the right team, haha.
%campaign_promote_nova_43%	Oh! And the producers are quite interested in the community service thing, by the way.
%campaign_promote_nova_47%	Ah... I was so nervous talking with the warriors. They're super intimidating.
%campaign_promote_nova_49%	But as it happens, they're also super nice!
%campaign_promote_nova_51%	They are very loyal to Dahlia so I don't know if I managed to make a dent in their plans, but, well, it was a learning experience nonetheless.
%campaign_promote_nova_55%	They were super happy that I'm helping Dahlia become the new leader.
%campaign_promote_nova_59%	I just came back from meeting with some explorer witches.
%campaign_promote_nova_60%	From what I've gathered, they're a bit divided between wanting more freedom but also wanting the coven to invest more in common projects.
%campaign_promote_nova_62%	Some of them saw the potential in our program, anyway.
%campaign_promote_nova_67%	There was quite the interest in the ministry system you're proposing.
%campaign_promote_nova_68%	Having a Ministry of Cosmic Exploration sounded delightful to them.
%campaign_promote_nova_72%	I had a meeting with some of the oracle witches.
%campaign_promote_nova_73%	Super mysterious!
%campaign_promote_nova_75%	I put special emphasis on your good heart and how you've helped me!
%campaign_promote_nova_77%	What they don't like much is that you're letting another Witch take the reins. They believe it should be you running.
%campaign_promote_nova_78%	I tried to make them trust in our party but I don't know if I had any success.
%campaign_promote_nova_82%	They seem to like the idea of having a kind oracle as their leader.
%campaign_promote_nova_87%	And, oh! They're interested in your idea of eating Aedana by yourself and becoming some kind of super Witch.
%campaign_promote_patrice_5%	I went and tried to put those novices in their place, but they're not ready to see sense yet.
%campaign_promote_patrice_6%	Eh... ok. I think it's best we have you focus on a different demographic.
%campaign_promote_patrice_7%	...
%campaign_promote_patrice_8%	I'm sorry.
%campaign_promote_patrice_12%	I had a long chat with some academics, I believe it went pretty well.
%campaign_promote_patrice_15%	Some parts of our program were a tough sell, but I got them to see the potential of our proposal.
%campaign_promote_patrice_18%	As one of the coven's archivists I know most of the academics well. I'd say it was a productive meeting.
%campaign_promote_patrice_20%	I got many of them to see the potential of our proposal.
%campaign_promote_patrice_28%	They were especially interested in the permit system for the Forbidden Arts.
%campaign_promote_patrice_29%	It makes them feel safe to know that no novice could misuse dangerous magic, but they like that it allows them to make good use of the most powerful spells.
%campaign_promote_patrice_30%	Good work.
%campaign_promote_patrice_34%	I think my meeting with the producers was good.
%campaign_promote_patrice_37%	They're all too fond of Jasmine, but still I managed to snatch some votes toward our side.
%campaign_promote_patrice_40%	It was an easy sell because Jasmine is some kind of hero among producers, or so it seems.
%campaign_promote_patrice_49%	The producers are quite interested in the community service thing, by the way. Good move.
%campaign_promote_patrice_53%	Ugh... Warriors aren't an easy lot to talk to.
%campaign_promote_patrice_54%	I believe it's better that I steer clear of them. We ended up in a pissing contest that led to no good.
%campaign_promote_patrice_56%	They're too loyal to Dahlia, anyway.
%campaign_promote_patrice_59%	We're lucky that they're so fond of Dahlia. If they weren't I'm sure I would have scared them all towards our rivals.
%campaign_promote_patrice_63%	I'm back from my meeting with the explorers. I explained to them why our program is their best prospect.
%campaign_promote_patrice_66%	They were quite skeptical, but I managed to bring some of them to our side.
%campaign_promote_patrice_70%	As a fellow explorer, once they knew I was on the team, it was easy to get them to support us.
%campaign_promote_patrice_71%	I know what drives us, after all.
%campaign_promote_patrice_75%	I had a meeting with some of the Oracle Witches.
%campaign_promote_patrice_76%	They're quite the reserved lot.
%campaign_promote_patrice_78%	They're totally pissed that you're letting another Witch take the reins. They believe it should be you running.
%campaign_promote_patrice_79%	Ahem, told you so.
%campaign_promote_patrice_81%	I managed to snatch some votes, in any case.
%campaign_promote_patrice_85%	They seem to like the idea of keeping a fellow oracle at the helm, in any case. It was a good meeting, I think.
%campaign_promote_patrice_90%	To my surprise, they're quite interested in your wild idea of eating Aedana by yourself and becoming some kind of super Witch.
%campaign_promote_patrice_91%	They're all curious to see what an extremely powerful oracle can achieve.
%campaign_tasks_2%	I'd like you to...
%campaign_tasks_5%	Look for allies and opportunities.
%campaign_tasks_6%	Challenge an opponent's program.
%campaign_tasks_7%	Promote our program.
%campaign_tasks_8%	Dig up dirt on our opponents.
%campaign_tasks_9%	Harvest energy.
%campaign_tasks_10%	Never mind.
%campaign_tasks_14%	Never mind.
%campaign_tasks_23%	Understood. I'll comb the cosmos and see what I can find.
%campaign_tasks_26%	Nice, I have some ideas in mind already.
%campaign_tasks_27%	See you in a few cycles.
%campaign_tasks_30%	Ah, I don't know the coven that well, but I'll try!
%campaign_tasks_33%	I got you. Let me see what I can find.
%campaign_tasks_36%	Yes! Allies will always make you stronger!
%campaign_tasks_37%	I'll go out and see what I can bring to the table.
%campaign_tasks_40%	Good plan. We need all the support we can get.
%campaign_tasks_41%	I'll be back soon.
%campaign_tasks_47%	Mmm... Whose program should we challenge?
%campaign_tasks_50%	Dahlia.
%campaign_tasks_51%	Jasmine.
%campaign_tasks_52%	Cupressa.
%campaign_tasks_53%	Never mind.
%campaign_tasks_57%	Specifically...
%campaign_tasks_58%	Let's go after this point of Dahlia's program.
%campaign_tasks_61%	Judgment: Referendum.
%campaign_tasks_62%	Law Enforcement: No Enforcement.
%campaign_tasks_63%	Forbidden Arts: Free Access & Education.
%campaign_tasks_64%	Mortal Affairs: Sever Ties.
%campaign_tasks_65%	Witch Duties: Magical Tax.
%campaign_tasks_66%	Aedana's Corpse: Scatter her remains.
%campaign_tasks_67%	Never mind.
%campaign_tasks_90%	Specifically...
%campaign_tasks_91%	Let's go after this point of Jasmine's program.
%campaign_tasks_94%	Judgment: Quorum of Eldest Witches.
%campaign_tasks_95%	Law Enforcement: Warnings Leading to Expulsion.
%campaign_tasks_96%	Forbidden Arts: Banning.
%campaign_tasks_97%	Mortal Affairs: Guide and protect.
%campaign_tasks_98%	Witch Duties: Freedom and Trust.
%campaign_tasks_99%	Aedana's Corpse: Devour her.
%campaign_tasks_100%	Never mind.
%campaign_tasks_123%	Specifically...
%campaign_tasks_124%	Let's go after this point of Cupressa's program.
%campaign_tasks_127%	Judgment: Quorum of Eldest Witches.
%campaign_tasks_128%	Law Enforcement: Exile.
%campaign_tasks_129%	Forbidden Arts: Banning.
%campaign_tasks_130%	Mortal Affairs: Exploit.
%campaign_tasks_131%	Witch Duties: Quarterly Controls.
%campaign_tasks_132%	Aedana's Corpse: Keep her as an Oracle.
%campaign_tasks_133%	Never mind.
%campaign_tasks_162%	Gotcha, I'm on it.
%campaign_tasks_165%	Understood. Let's hope they listen to the youngest witch of the coven.
%campaign_tasks_168%	Very well, I'll give them something to think about.
%campaign_tasks_171%	Oh, yes, they are going to hear me.
%campaign_tasks_174%	Very well. It's important that we voice our concerns to the community.
%campaign_tasks_186%	We're running that very same point in our program, idiot.
%campaign_tasks_187%	Please focus, Fortuna.
%campaign_tasks_190%	Ah... I don't think we should be attacking a point that we also have in our program...
%campaign_tasks_191%	Let's reconsider?
%campaign_tasks_194%	Darling... we're running that very same point in our program.
%campaign_tasks_195%	Better choose a different objective.
%campaign_tasks_198%	Alright! I'm on it!
%campaign_tasks_199%	...Wait...
%campaign_tasks_200%	Don't we have that same point in our program!?
%campaign_tasks_201%	We can't attack our own ideas, Fortuna!
%campaign_tasks_204%	Mmm... Fortuna, we can't do that.
%campaign_tasks_205%	We have the same point in our program, it'd be silly to challenge it.
%campaign_tasks_209%	Let's focus our efforts on this group:
%campaign_tasks_212%	Novices.
%campaign_tasks_213%	Academics.
%campaign_tasks_214%	Producers.
%campaign_tasks_215%	Warriors.
%campaign_tasks_216%	Explorers.
%campaign_tasks_217%	Oracles.
%campaign_tasks_218%	Never mind.
%campaign_tasks_246%	Ok, I'll do my best.
%campaign_tasks_247%	I'll be back in a few cycles.
%campaign_tasks_250%	Oh! Exciting!
%campaign_tasks_251%	I'll go and spread the good word, absolutely!
%campaign_tasks_254%	I've got some very good ideas about how to draw Witches towards our program.
%campaign_tasks_255%	I'm on it.
%campaign_tasks_258%	Campaign time! Here we go!
%campaign_tasks_261%	I'll be delighted to go out there and tell our sisters about our plans!
%campaign_tasks_272%	Heh... turning invisible may prove useful for this.
%campaign_tasks_273%	Let me see what I can find. I'll be back.
%campaign_tasks_276%	Mmm... it may take some time.
%campaign_tasks_277%	I'll see what I can find, and later we can decide if it's ok to use in a debate.
%campaign_tasks_280%	Ah... but I barely know anyone yet.
%campaign_tasks_281%	But I want to be useful... I'll see what I can find.
%campaign_tasks_284%	I got you. I'll ask some contacts of mine.
%campaign_tasks_285%	It may take me a while. See you soon.
%campaign_tasks_288%	Urgh... A candidate shouldn't be doing this herself, right?
%campaign_tasks_289%	Better assign this task to someone else.
%campaign_tasks_292%	Mmm... I'd rather avoid getting my hands dirty.
%campaign_tasks_293%	If I were to be caught spying on a rival it'd make me look really bad!
%campaign_tasks_305%	Your wish is my command.
%campaign_tasks_306%	I'll get you some fresh energy.
%campaign_tasks_309%	Sure, I'll get you some energy.
%campaign_tasks_310%	I'll be back.
%campaign_tasks_313%	Oh, harvesting energy, how exciting!
%campaign_tasks_314%	I'll bring lots of it!
%campaign_tasks_317%	Of course. I'll get you the best energy in the galaxy.
%campaign_tasks_320%	Energy, you say?
%campaign_tasks_321%	Just wait, I'll bring you a lot!
%campaign_tasks_324%	Harvesting energy?
%campaign_tasks_325%	Not something I envisioned the candidate doing, but sure, if you need it.
%campaign_tasks_326%	I'll be back.
%cupressa_2%	Hello.
%cupressa_3%	I am Cupressa, nice to meet you.
%cupressa_4%	Welcome, I am Fortuna. Nice to meet you too.
%cupressa_5%	Thanks for having me. I wanted to introduce myself formally before the race becomes hectic.
%cupressa_7%	Why me? I'm not the one running.
%cupressa_8%	Oh, I know, but you are one of the major players in these elections.
%cupressa_9%	A driving force, as Aedana would put it.
%cupressa_12%	That is so kind of you.
%cupressa_13%	I'm sorry that you had to come all the way here. There are still 800 years of exile left in the sentence Aedana cast over me.
%cupressa_14%	I'm well aware.
%cupressa_16%	Aedana often confided in me.
%cupressa_17%	The fear you inspired her was one of her greatest weaknesses.
%cupressa_18%	Oh, wow. I don't know how to feel about that.
%cupressa_19%	That makes two of us. That's the main reason I decided to pay you a visit.
%cupressa_20%	To keep me in check?
%cupressa_21%	To form my own judgment.
%cupressa_24%	I promise I carry the best of intentions.
%cupressa_25%	Aedana was right. You should fear me too.
%cupressa_26%	Don't be so harsh... I'm nice, I promise.
%cupressa_30%	I promise I carry the best of intentions.
%cupressa_31%	Mmm...
%cupressa_34%	There's a certain aura around you that tells me I can trust you.
%cupressa_35%	Plants... we're more sensitive to this kind of energy.
%cupressa_36%	Now I see that Aedana's fear was unfounded, a product of her decaying mind.
%cupressa_39%	I don't know, my flowers become restless when exposed to your voice.
%cupressa_41%	There's something about you... inevitable, like a forest fire.
%cupressa_42%	And no matter its intentions, fire is fire.
%cupressa_45%	Not even you yourself believe in your words.
%cupressa_46%	Maybe your intentions are good, but you lack the power or confidence to carry them out.
%cupressa_47%	Aedana was wrong to fear you.
%cupressa_51%	Aedana was right. You should fear me too.
%cupressa_52%	Mmm...
%cupressa_55%	You're trying to protect me by pushing me away.
%cupressa_56%	How admirable of you. I can respect that.
%cupressa_58%	Maybe Aedana wasn't scared as much as threatened.
%cupressa_59%	You certainly carry the presence of those who know fate is in their hands.
%cupressa_62%	I do fear you.
%cupressa_63%	Even more now that I've seen your first genuine reaction.
%cupressa_66%	Heh heh heh...
%cupressa_67%	You're so scared that you need to show your teeth to get a hold of the situation.
%cupressa_68%	But your intimidation is just adorable, like a dog barking up a tree.
%cupressa_69%	Aedana must have briefly lost her judgment before her imminent passing.
%cupressa_70%	You are no threat. When I come to power I will lift your sentence.
%cupressa_74%	Don't be so harsh... I'm nice, I promise.
%cupressa_75%	Mmm...
%cupressa_78%	Don't sell yourself short.
%cupressa_79%	I can sense it, you're not just "nice."
%cupressa_80%	You're also powerful and intelligent.
%cupressa_83%	Oh, no... you are the worst kind of threat.
%cupressa_84%	A liar.
%cupressa_85%	Trying to present yourself as inoffensive but...
%cupressa_88%	Poor thing.
%cupressa_89%	You're out of your depth, aren't you?
%cupressa_90%	Don't worry, we're all sisters here.
%cupressa_91%	It doesn't matter who wins, we will take care of each other, alright?
%cupressa_95%	Knowing this, I must ask you and your team to retire from the race.
%cupressa_98%	What!? Why?
%cupressa_99%	Hahaha, nice strategy.
%cupressa_100%	Get out of my house immediately.
%cupressa_104%	What!? Why?
%cupressa_108%	Hahaha, nice strategy.
%cupressa_109%	I didn't say that in jest.
%cupressa_111%	You are too close to your human side to properly govern a cosmic coven.
%cupressa_112%	That's what made Aedana such a great leader. She had a direct channel of communication with the gods and was far detached from her human origins.
%cupressa_113%	On the other hand... You, Dahlia, and Jasmine...
%cupressa_114%	You have an uncountable number of human flaws:
%cupressa_115%	Fear, pride, envy, greed...
%cupressa_116%	Even what you consider virtues such as ambition or mercy...
%cupressa_117%	Or even the most basic things, such as the need for comfort or enjoyment, cloud your judgment.
%cupressa_118%	Flaws, flaws, flaws.
%cupressa_121%	And how are you better than us?
%cupressa_122%	But, without feelings, can you truly care for your peers?
%cupressa_123%	Ok, you are a psychopath. Get out of my house.
%cupressa_127%	And how are you better than us?
%cupressa_129%	Have you ever stopped to study the flora?
%cupressa_130%	Most Witches are too fauna-centric to see other forms of coexistence.
%cupressa_131%	As a tree, my entelechy is that of growth and community.
%cupressa_132%	I lack individuality, I'm just part of a forest. We, the plants, grow, expand and nurture all around us.
%cupressa_133%	The majority of us don't need to feed on other living beings to prosper.
%cupressa_134%	That basic fact alters our whole perception of reality.
%cupressa_135%	Human existence is so built on top of sacrifice that you are immune to innumerable forms of brutality.
%cupressa_136%	You are devourer of worlds, and we the plants are their healers.
%cupressa_140%	But, without feelings, can you truly care for your peers?
%cupressa_141%	There are many beings in this universe that are better suited for leadership than your kind precisely because of this lack of human feelings.
%cupressa_145%	Get out of my house immediately.
%cupressa_148%	Ok, you are a psychopath. Get out of my house.
%cupressa_150%	Typical human reaction.
%cupressa_151%	Not an attitude that will reflect well on your character.
%cupressa_154%	Treating the opposition like this is going to affect your party. I doubt Jasmine will be happy about this.
%cupressa_155%	She at least tries. She's learnt from observing her garden, after all...
%cupressa_158%	Goodbye.
%cupressa_162%	I will make sure everyone knows what to expect from a short-tempered leader such as yourself.
%cupressa_165%	You and Dahlia make a good fit. Both barbarians in philosophy.
%cupressa_166%	I won't let such ill-mannered Witches ascend to power. I will let our sisters know about your attitude.
%cupressa_170%	I'm going to take care of you no matter how you treat me.
%cupressa_171%	Let me ask you a question.
%cupressa_172%	What's the most important quality in a leader?
%cupressa_175%	Intelligence.
%cupressa_176%	Selflessness.
%cupressa_177%	Empathy.
%cupressa_178%	Charisma.
%cupressa_179%	Integrity.
%cupressa_183%	Intelligence.
%cupressa_184%	That's always desirable, yes.
%cupressa_185%	But it's also quite volatile when exposed to frustration, temptation, wrath...
%cupressa_186%	Among the human species, it's typical to find the highest amount of intelligence among its most dubious characters.
%cupressa_190%	Selflessness.
%cupressa_191%	Exactly.
%cupressa_195%	Empathy.
%cupressa_196%	A very useful trait to understand the fear and needs of your community.
%cupressa_197%	Probably the trait in which I am most lacking.
%cupressa_198%	But empathy is a double-edged sword.
%cupressa_199%	Historically, empathetic leaders often crash and burn, overwhelmed by the contradicting angst of their people.
%cupressa_200%	A characteristic that can quickly turn to weakness.
%cupressa_204%	Charisma.
%cupressa_205%	A critical trait for persuading your community and allies to follow your plans, yes.
%cupressa_206%	Humans excel at it.
%cupressa_207%	However, much like love, charisma clouds the judgment of both leaders and followers.
%cupressa_208%	Plus it's often a time-bomb of ego and vanity.
%cupressa_212%	Integrity.
%cupressa_213%	Oh, I know what you mean. But in all the millennia I've been around, I've found it to be quite the idealistic concept.
%cupressa_214%	What is integrity? Is it to have strong moral values?
%cupressa_215%	But how are those values defined to begin with?
%cupressa_216%	Does integrity respond to the values of the community, or those of the individual? What happens when those values conflict with someone else's?
%cupressa_217%	I've seen integrity redefined over and over again, both inside and outside this coven.
%cupressa_218%	There is one other quality that's always immutable and true, though.
%cupressa_222%	Maybe, but...
%cupressa_224%	Selflessness.
%cupressa_225%	That's the most important trait in a leader.
%cupressa_227%	To put the group's needs before your own.
%cupressa_228%	And even if you invented the word, humans aren't capable of it.
%cupressa_229%	All those emotions we talked about before, they're what make it impossible.
%cupressa_230%	Satisfaction, respect, honor, friendship... The list is endless.
%cupressa_231%	Humans are capable of selfless actions, but not of selfless existences.
%cupressa_234%	A leader deprived of all that is just an automata.
%cupressa_235%	You're right, but I still want to lead.
%cupressa_236%	You're right, but I'd still have Dahlia as our leader.
%cupressa_237%	You're right, but I'd still have Jasmine as our leader.
%cupressa_238%	Are you implying that humans should never lead?
%cupressa_242%	A leader deprived of all that is just an automata.
%cupressa_243%	And what's the problem with that?
%cupressa_244%	A leader needs drive, a vision. They need to take risks.
%cupressa_245%	And gamble with the future of a whole community?
%cupressa_246%	Yes.
%cupressa_247%	You put your trust in a leader because you believe in the change they propose.
%cupressa_248%	Otherwise you're just appointing an administrator.
%cupressa_249%	And what's wrong with having a fair administrator?
%cupressa_250%	Stagnation. Unlike plants, we consider movement to be a symptom of life.
%cupressa_251%	I see... so that's what you and your sisters value over stability.
%cupressa_252%	I'm afraid human-born Witches are like that, yes.
%cupressa_253%	Thank you, you've helped me to understand our coven better.
%cupressa_257%	You're right, but I still want to lead.
%cupressa_258%	Even if you are not the optimal choice?
%cupressa_259%	That's right.
%cupressa_260%	I want to lead because I want to create a world in which people like me can prosper and find happiness and fulfillment.
%cupressa_262%	Isn't that egoistical?
%cupressa_265%	Yes, and I don't care. This is what I want.
%cupressa_266%	Not really. I'm genuinely trying to do what's best.
%cupressa_267%	Yes, but is there any other option?
%cupressa_271%	Yes, and I don't care. This is what I want.
%cupressa_272%	In that case I guess there's not much more for us to debate.
%cupressa_274%	I'm afraid that in the end it all boils down to what each of us wants.
%cupressa_275%	You may be right about that.
%cupressa_279%	Not really. I'm genuinely trying to do what's best.
%cupressa_280%	How naive...
%cupressa_281%	Wishing to be right doesn't make it so.
%cupressa_282%	Probably...
%cupressa_286%	Yes, but is there any other option?
%cupressa_287%	Yes. I'm offering you that option.
%cupressa_288%	But don't you see that even your philosophy about "selflessness" is really just what you want for this coven?
%cupressa_289%	Mmm...
%cupressa_290%	Have you considered that stability is not what most of the coven wants?
%cupressa_291%	Don't they?
%cupressa_292%	I don't know. We'll find out what the coven wants through this election.
%cupressa_293%	I understand. Thank you, you have made me think.
%cupressa_297%	You're right, but I'd still have Dahlia as our leader.
%cupressa_298%	Even if Dahlia is not the optimal choice?
%cupressa_299%	That's right.
%cupressa_300%	I'm supporting Dahlia because she wants to create a world in which people like me can prosper and find happiness and fulfillment.
%cupressa_304%	You're right, but I'd still have Jasmine as our leader.
%cupressa_305%	Even if Jasmine is not the optimal choice?
%cupressa_306%	That's right.
%cupressa_307%	I'm supporting Jasmine because that's the future I want for our coven.
%cupressa_311%	Are you implying that humans should never lead?
%cupressa_312%	When avoidable, yes.
%cupressa_314%	On Earth they don't have much choice, with all sentient life being underdeveloped besides them.
%cupressa_315%	But here? We have gods, we have Deerfolk, you have me.
%cupressa_318%	Look at what's happened on Earth.
%cupressa_319%	Since that digital entity took the reins, humanity's reached a golden age of peaceful coexistence.
%cupressa_321%	What if I don't want to be ruled?
%cupressa_322%	What if I don't agree with what allegedly "superior beings" have devised for me?
%cupressa_323%	I want to create a world closer to my vision.
%cupressa_327%	Listen, Cupressa...
%cupressa_330%	(Use the Eye of Aedana to look inside Cupressa.)
%cupressa_331%	Would you like me to read your fortune?
%cupressa_332%	Good luck with the race.
%cupressa_336%	(Mmm... What's this buried emotion?)
%cupressa_337%	(!!!)
%cupressa_338%	What's the matter?
%cupressa_341%	I know that you are in love with Aedana.
%cupressa_342%	(Poor Cupressa. I won't bother her about it.)
%cupressa_346%	I know you are in love with Aedana.
%cupressa_347%	...
%cupressa_348%	That is nonsense.
%cupressa_349%	Doesn't that conflict with the selflessness you were talking about?
%cupressa_350%	It sounds like a liability for the kind of leadership you're proposing.
%cupressa_351%	I'm just aware of how big of a loss it is for our coven that Aedana died.
%cupressa_352%	Maybe you are mistaking that for love.
%cupressa_353%	No. You love her. Romantically. She gave me her eyes, I can see through you.
%cupressa_354%	...
%cupressa_355%	Oh, wow! That's why your program includes keeping her corpse intact!
%cupressa_356%	Please. Don't say anything.
%cupressa_357%	I'm trying to purge this emotion from myself, but I still haven't worked out how to.
%cupressa_358%	This has nothing to do with the race. Please, keep it between us.
%cupressa_361%	Don't worry, I'll respect your privacy.
%cupressa_362%	No way, our sisters must be made aware of this.
%cupressa_363%	Absolutely, if you say I'm your favorite rival.
%cupressa_364%	Absolutely, if you say Dahlia's your favorite rival.
%cupressa_365%	Absolutely, if you say Jasmine's your favorite rival.
%cupressa_370%	Don't worry, I'll respect your privacy.
%cupressa_371%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%cupressa_372%	Your sympathy won't be forgotten.
%cupressa_377%	No way, our sisters must be made aware of this.
%cupressa_378%	...
%cupressa_379%	Do as you must.
%cupressa_380%	I guess it would be hypocritical of me to hide my feelings...
%cupressa_381%	My priority is the coven. It'd be selfish of me to keep this from the others.
%cupressa_382%	...
%cupressa_387%	Absolutely, if you say I'm your favorite rival.
%cupressa_388%	Come again? "Favorite"?
%cupressa_389%	Should you be prompted to choose which opponent you think has the best program--beside yours, of course--you just say it's me.
%cupressa_390%	Like, if you weren't to win, you'd rather have me at the helm.
%cupressa_392%	...
%cupressa_393%	Ok, I can do that. Although my true favorite is Jasmine.
%cupressa_394%	Yeah, I figured that much.
%cupressa_396%	I'd better leave now.
%cupressa_397%	I'm sorry.
%cupressa_398%	No. You're not.
%cupressa_404%	Absolutely, if you say Dahlia's your favorite rival.
%cupressa_405%	Come again? "Favorite"?
%cupressa_406%	Should you be prompted to choose which opponent you think has the best program--beside yours, of course--you just say it's Dahlia.
%cupressa_407%	Like, if you weren't to win, you'd rather have Dahlia at the helm.
%cupressa_412%	Absolutely, if you say Jasmine's your favorite rival.
%cupressa_413%	Come again? "Favorite"?
%cupressa_414%	Should you be prompted to choose which opponent you think has the best program--beside yours, of course--you just say it's Jasmine.
%cupressa_415%	Like, if you weren't to win, you'd rather have Jasmine at the helm.
%cupressa_416%	...
%cupressa_417%	Ok, I can do that. Jasmine was my favorite anyway.
%cupressa_418%	Right? It's just a small favor.
%cupressa_422%	Ah... Nothing.
%cupressa_424%	I think it's time for me to leave now.
%cupressa_427%	Wait, would you like me to read your fortune?
%cupressa_428%	Good luck with the race.
%cupressa_432%	Good luck with the race.
%cupressa_433%	Good luck to you too.
%cupressa_438%	Would you like me to read your fortune?
%cupressa_439%	Mmm? Would you do that for an opponent?
%cupressa_442%	Of course. My priority is to help the coven.
%cupressa_443%	Yeah, you're right... I shouldn't.
%cupressa_447%	Yeah, you're right... I shouldn't.
%cupressa_448%	Think twice before speaking, sister.
%cupressa_449%	I know. I'm sorry.
%cupressa_450%	Thank you for receiving me in your home. Good luck.
%cupressa_451%	Good luck to you too.
%cupressa_456%	Of course, My priority is to help the coven.
%cupressa_457%	Very well, let's see what fortune has in store for me.
%earth_seal_activation_5%	While I was charting a dark matter cloud for the coven, I met with the corpse of a Witch that was clutching an object of power.
%earth_seal_activation_6%	Since they lost their will, they didn't mind letting me have it.
%earth_seal_activation_9%	Last year I spent a great deal of time cataloging the coven's texts and treatises on objects of power.
%earth_seal_activation_10%	And there was one specific object that kept making me think of you.
%earth_seal_activation_13%	One of my clients offered me this as payment after getting them out of quite a salacious predicament.
%earth_seal_activation_14%	I never found the opportunity to use it, but I feel fate had me save it for you.
%earth_seal_activation_17%	Remember those articles on the Cosmic Gazette you dislike so much?
%earth_seal_activation_18%	Like "12 objects of power that'll make your life easier."
%earth_seal_activation_19%	Well, as it happens, number five will shock you.
%earth_seal_activation_21%	Here:
%earth_seal_activation_26%	The Root of Aplomb.
%earth_seal_activation_27%	Swallow it and it'll increase your powers of persuasion.
%earth_seal_activation_28%	Oh, wow, thank you Patrice.
%earth_seal_activation_29%	It'll live in your stomach for decades, liberating the very essence of willpower, atom by atom. It'll also siphon away your self-doubt.
%earth_seal_activation_31%	It'd be way more effective if you ran for leader yourself.
%earth_seal_activation_32%	I'm still wrapping my head around the fact that you decided to play a supporting role, given your true nature.
%earth_seal_activation_33%	Here we go... what "true nature"?
%earth_seal_activation_34%	You've always relied only on yourself. This is quite unlike you, that's all I'm saying.
%earth_seal_activation_35%	We've already had this conversation.
%earth_seal_activation_36%	You're right. We'd better focus on helpful things.
%earth_seal_activation_39%	It'll be especially handy for debates against other candidates.
%earth_seal_activation_40%	Or for striking deals when dealing with visits here at home.
%earth_seal_activation_41%	That's just perfect, thank you so much.
%earth_seal_activation_42%	I got you covered.
%earth_seal_activation_48%	A Sympathy Stone.
%earth_seal_activation_49%	It's a special object of power that will amplify the efforts of whoever's trying to help you.
%earth_seal_activation_50%	Oh, wow, thank you Patrice.
%earth_seal_activation_51%	Just wet a brush with some freshly brewed sage infusion and write down the names of your allies on it.
%earth_seal_activation_52%	I'll do it immediately. I love it. Thank you.
%earth_seal_activation_53%	I got you.
%earth_seal_activation_54%	So basically, this charm will render the tasks you assign us more effective.
%earth_seal_activation_55%	Got it.
%earth_seal_activation_61%	The Conqueror's Medal.
%earth_seal_activation_62%	It's a cursed object of power, but I guess the times call for its use.
%earth_seal_activation_63%	It will hinder the efforts of your opponents and will increase the effectiveness of actions taken against them.
%earth_seal_activation_66%	Urgh... sounds like playing dirty.
%earth_seal_activation_67%	That's just perfect. No mercy.
%earth_seal_activation_71%	Urgh... sounds like playing dirty.
%earth_seal_activation_72%	Hah! You think your rivals aren't gonna use every trick they have up their sleeve to win this race?
%earth_seal_activation_73%	We are Witches! We compete like Witches!
%earth_seal_activation_74%	But the curse part...?
%earth_seal_activation_76%	I mean, it's cursed, but not forbidden.
%earth_seal_activation_77%	Maybe some ghost will come and torment you after the race. But we'll deal with them, no sweat.
%earth_seal_activation_78%	Haha... sure?
%earth_seal_activation_82%	That's just perfect. No mercy.
%earth_seal_activation_83%	That's it, shark mentality, hahaha.
%earth_seal_activation_84%	What about it being cursed, though?
%earth_seal_activation_88%	Anyway, let's get to work.
%earth_seal_activation_89%	Let's make sure we all have a task and get this ball rolling.
%earth_seal_activation_90%	Stay motivated!
%earth_seal_activation_91%	Alright! Tasks...
%illusion_world_2_2%	...
%illusion_world_2_3%	...
%illusion_world_2_4%	What's going on?
%illusion_world_2_5%	We should get back to the asteroid, Patrice.
%illusion_world_2_6%	What!?
%illusion_world_2_7%	Oh, no... she's lost it forever, Eva...
%illusion_world_2_8%	Deep breaths, everyone.
%illusion_world_3_2%	...
%illusion_world_3_3%	Did I travel back in time?
%illusion_world_3_4%	Oh, come on...
%illusion_world_3_5%	No, sweetheart, you haven't traveled back in time.
%illusion_world_3_6%	Where do you think you've come from?
%illusion_world_3_7%	Outer space, centuries into the future.
%illusion_world_3_8%	Ah... And how's that possible?
%illusion_world_3_9%	I'm a Witch.
%illusion_world_3_10%	Stop it! Don't enable her fantasies, Eva!
%illusion_world_3_11%	It's not fantasy, you're a Witch too! Wake up, Patrice!
%illusion_world_3_15%	You're a space journalist! You founded the Cosmic Gazette!
%illusion_world_3_18%	You work as an archivist in our coven!
%illusion_world_3_21%	You're a cosmic detective!
%illusion_world_3_24%	You're a cosmic cartographer!
%illusion_world_3_26%	Oh, no...
%illusion_world_3_27%	For the love of god, what are you saying, Fortuna...
%illusion_world_3_28%	Ok, let's not panic.
%illusion_world_3_29%	This will pass, it's just some kind of stress-related crisis.
%illusion_world_3_30%	I believe we'll be able to better help her if we ask her about her... predicament.
%illusion_world_3_31%	I'm sure there must be some truth hidden in the Witch fantasy.
%illusion_world_3_32%	Are you sure...?
%illusion_world_3_33%	It's worth a shot.
%illusion_world_3_34%	Ok... you take the lead. This is too much for me...
%illusion_world_3_35%	Ok, mmm...
%illusion_world_3_36%	Fortuna, can you tell us more about your Witch coven from outer space?
%illusion_world_3_37%	Huh... sure.
%illusion_world_3_38%	We are about 100 Witches.
%illusion_world_3_39%	Our coven is one of the most respected in the magic community.
%illusion_world_3_40%	Just recently, our leader died, and we were in the process of electing a new one.
%illusion_world_3_41%	Mmm... ok...
%illusion_world_3_42%	Tell me more about these elections.
%illusion_world_3_45%	I'm running for leader.
%illusion_world_3_46%	I'm helping my friend Jasmine become the new leader.
%illusion_world_3_47%	I'm helping my friend Dahlia become the new leader.
%illusion_world_3_48%	It's a shit-show.
%illusion_world_3_49%	It's going to determine the fate of the Witch world.
%illusion_world_3_53%	I'm running for leader.
%illusion_world_3_56%	I'm helping my friend Jasmine become the new leader.
%illusion_world_3_59%	I'm helping my friend Dahlia become the new leader.
%illusion_world_3_63%	It's a shit-show.
%illusion_world_3_66%	It's going to determine the fate of the Witch world.
%illusion_world_3_68%	Oh, yeah? Why?
%illusion_world_3_71%	Ah... I don't know.
%illusion_world_3_72%	Our coven is too powerful.
%illusion_world_3_73%	Because I messed with fate too much using my cards.
%illusion_world_3_77%	Ah... I don't know.
%illusion_world_3_78%	You don't know?
%illusion_world_3_79%	Come on, I'm sure there's more you can tell us, like...
%illusion_world_3_81%	What role do you play in these elections?
%illusion_world_3_88%	Our coven is too powerful.
%illusion_world_3_89%	Oh, wow.
%illusion_world_3_90%	It must be such a big responsibility.
%illusion_world_3_94%	Because I messed with fate too much using my cards.
%illusion_world_3_96%	Oh, wow. And why are your cards so powerful?
%illusion_world_3_99%	Ah... it's too complicated.
%illusion_world_3_100%	I'm not a fortune teller. I can override fate.
%illusion_world_3_104%	Ah... it's too complicated.
%illusion_world_3_105%	Try me. Come on, I want to know. What's the deal with your new deck?
%illusion_world_3_108%	I'd rather not get into that, please.
%illusion_world_3_109%	I'm not a fortune teller. I can override fate.
%illusion_world_3_110%	...Why are you so interested in it?
%illusion_world_3_114%	I'd rather not get into that, please.
%illusion_world_3_115%	Ah... mmm...
%illusion_world_3_116%	Ok, why don't you tell us about something else, like...
%illusion_world_3_121%	I'm not a fortune teller. I can override fate.
%illusion_world_3_122%	What does that mean?
%illusion_world_3_123%	When I use my cards, I'm not foretelling what'll happen.
%illusion_world_3_124%	I'm deciding it. I can even alter the past.
%illusion_world_3_125%	Holy shit.
%illusion_world_3_126%	And are you using that to manipulate the elections?
%illusion_world_3_129%	Yeah, I guess.
%illusion_world_3_130%	Huh... This is getting weird.
%illusion_world_3_135%	Yeah, I guess.
%illusion_world_3_136%	Wow.
%illusion_world_3_137%	Could you detail the ways you have manipulated everything?
%illusion_world_3_140%	FORTUNA.
%illusion_world_3_141%	WAKE UP.
%illusion_world_3_142%	THEY'RE MESSING WITH YOU.
%illusion_world_3_147%	Huh... This is getting weird.
%illusion_world_3_148%	Oh, why do you say that?
%illusion_world_3_149%	I'm just trying to help you.
%illusion_world_3_153%	...Why are you so interested in it?
%illusion_world_3_154%	Oh, I don't know, I'm just trying to understand what's going on with you.
%illusion_world_3_155%	You can tell me anything.
%illusion_world_3_159%	Oh, that's very cool!
%illusion_world_3_160%	And what are your plans for the coven?
%illusion_world_3_163%	I want to make everyone happy.
%illusion_world_3_164%	To undo the damage our last leader caused.
%illusion_world_3_165%	To make us more powerful than ever.
%illusion_world_3_166%	To reshape the whole universe.
%illusion_world_3_167%	...Why are you so interested in this?
%illusion_world_3_172%	I want to make everyone happy.
%illusion_world_3_173%	Aww... that's so nice.
%illusion_world_3_178%	To undo the damage our last leader caused.
%illusion_world_3_179%	Oh, wow, you must hate that person, right?
%illusion_world_3_182%	With all my soul.
%illusion_world_3_183%	Huh... This is getting weird.
%illusion_world_3_188%	With all my soul.
%illusion_world_3_189%	...And did you do something to harm her?
%illusion_world_3_190%	What? What are you getting at?
%illusion_world_3_191%	Just answer me, it's important.
%illusion_world_3_196%	To make us more powerful than ever.
%illusion_world_3_197%	Oh, that's really ambitious.
%illusion_world_3_202%	To reshape the whole universe.
%illusion_world_3_203%	Wh-what?
%illusion_world_3_204%	And how do you plan to do that...?
%illusion_world_3_206%	Any ace up your sleeve to make that happen?
%illusion_world_3_209%	Oh, yes. I summoned a Behemoth.
%illusion_world_3_210%	Hard work and honesty!
%illusion_world_3_211%	(POWER) I reported you to the arbiters the moment this illusion began, Kurielle.
%illusion_world_3_215%	Hard work and honesty!
%illusion_world_3_216%	Yeah... right.
%illusion_world_3_217%	Excuse me?
%illusion_world_3_218%	Ah, nothing, I'm sorry.
%illusion_world_3_219%	Why don't you tell me about how you plan to counter your opponents' strategies?
%illusion_world_3_224%	I reported you to the arbiters the moment this illusion began, Kurielle.
%illusion_world_3_225%	H-how? What did you...?
%illusion_world_abramar_3%	Fortuna!
%illusion_world_abramar_4%	I'm here, I'm here.
%illusion_world_abramar_6%	What happened?
%illusion_world_abramar_7%	I found you eyes rolled-back, mumbling to yourself.
%illusion_world_abramar_8%	I was trapped in some kind of illusion...
%illusion_world_abramar_9%	Someone tried to make me believe I'm not a Witch, that it was all a delusion from before I ascended.
%illusion_world_abramar_10%	Oh, shit... they kept asking about the political race.
%illusion_world_abramar_11%	Did you disclose any... sensitive information?
%illusion_world_abramar_18%	No... I don't think so...
%illusion_world_abramar_19%	It all seemed too fishy, so I stayed evasive.
%illusion_world_abramar_21%	Good. Sharp instincts.
%illusion_world_abramar_24%	Crisis avoided. I'll get back to doing my thing.
%illusion_world_abramar_27%	Stay strong, we're almost at the finish line.
%illusion_world_abramar_32%	Ah... uh...
%illusion_world_abramar_33%	I kinda confessed I've been manipulating the elections with my powers.
%illusion_world_abramar_35%	Hahahahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_36%	Why are you laughing!?
%illusion_world_abramar_38%	I can't help myself, I like it messy.
%illusion_world_abramar_40%	You did a number on the team with this one.
%illusion_world_abramar_42%	Hahahahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_43%	Fuck my life...
%illusion_world_abramar_45%	Who cares.
%illusion_world_abramar_47%	Nothing can really stop you while I'm on your side.
%illusion_world_abramar_48%	Woke up confident today, huh?
%illusion_world_abramar_50%	Hahahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_52%	I'm in a good mood.
%illusion_world_abramar_54%	Our deal is almost complete.
%illusion_world_abramar_55%	I don't know if I should worry or embrace it at this point...
%illusion_world_abramar_57%	Just... try to enjoy it.
%illusion_world_abramar_58%	That's always the best attitude.
%illusion_world_abramar_59%	Sure.
%illusion_world_abramar_60%	Well, I'll get back to doing my thing.
%illusion_world_abramar_64%	I told them that my plan was to make everyone happy.
%illusion_world_abramar_66%	Hahahahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_67%	Why are you laughing!?
%illusion_world_abramar_68%	Now everyone is going to think we're fucking idiots, hahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_69%	I believe we come across as wholesome!
%illusion_world_abramar_70%	Hahahahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_72%	Anyway.
%illusion_world_abramar_76%	I kinda told them I was planning on undoing everything Aedana did.
%illusion_world_abramar_77%	Oh, well... It's bold, but perfectly legit, I'd say.
%illusion_world_abramar_78%	I guess so.
%illusion_world_abramar_79%	Very well.
%illusion_world_abramar_83%	I told them I hate Aedana, and that made them suspect I was the one who killed her or something?
%illusion_world_abramar_84%	Very good, that'll throw them off.
%illusion_world_abramar_85%	Huh? How's that good?
%illusion_world_abramar_86%	Did you kill Aedana?
%illusion_world_abramar_87%	No.
%illusion_world_abramar_88%	Exactly, this will send them on a wild goose chase.
%illusion_world_abramar_89%	Very well done.
%illusion_world_abramar_90%	Huh... sure.
%illusion_world_abramar_91%	Anyway.
%illusion_world_abramar_95%	I told them I want to make our coven more powerful than ever.
%illusion_world_abramar_97%	Oh, you anticipated their move and fed them a bunch of crap. Nice.
%illusion_world_abramar_98%	Ah? Well, I kinda want us to improve, don't I?
%illusion_world_abramar_100%	Hahahahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_101%	You were being genuine, sorry, sorry, hahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_102%	Good grief...
%illusion_world_abramar_104%	In any case, that's good.
%illusion_world_abramar_108%	I... told them I want to reshape this universe.
%illusion_world_abramar_110%	Hahahahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_111%	Now everyone will know you're a lunatic, hahahaha.
%illusion_world_abramar_112%	I guess we're in a bit of trouble? Haha.
%illusion_world_abramar_114%	Nah, who cares. It's more fun this way.
%illusion_world_arbiter_2%	You're free now. I dispelled the illusion.
%illusion_world_arbiter_3%	Oh, whoa, thanks. That was quite a trip.
%illusion_world_arbiter_5%	Are you alright?
%illusion_world_arbiter_6%	I'm fine now, thanks.
%illusion_world_arbiter_8%	My partners are arresting Kurielle as we speak.
%illusion_world_arbiter_9%	How did you know you were being bewitched?
%illusion_world_arbiter_10%	Aedana gave me a special trinket that amplified my powers.
%illusion_world_arbiter_11%	Thanks to that, I could easily see through the scheme.
%illusion_world_arbiter_13%	That's really cool!
%illusion_world_arbiter_14%	Is Kurielle going to be alright?
%illusion_world_arbiter_15%	Yes.
%illusion_world_arbiter_16%	She'll be brought in for interrogation and might get a minor sanction, but we're not talking about a major crime here.
%illusion_world_arbiter_17%	I see...
%illusion_world_arbiter_18%	We'll make sure that any information fraudulently obtained from you cannot be used.
%illusion_world_arbiter_19%	That's perfect, thank you so much.
%illusion_world_arbiter_20%	Thank you for counting on us!
%illusion_world_arbiter_22%	Anything for you to confess?
%illusion_world_arbiter_23%	Haha, no.
%illusion_world_arbiter_25%	Ok! Have a nice day!
%illusion_world_2%	Fortuna!!
%illusion_world_3%	Fortuna, talk to us!
%illusion_world_4%	...What happened?
%illusion_world_5%	What were you thinking, walking into the ocean like that!?
%illusion_world_6%	I drowned...?
%illusion_world_7%	Were you trying to kill yourself!?
%illusion_world_8%	What's all this about becoming a Witch?
%illusion_world_9%	Back off a bit, Patrice.
%illusion_world_10%	She's probably going through some kind of crisis...
%illusion_world_11%	It's alright, Fortuna. We're here with you.
%illusion_world_12%	What...?
%illusion_world_13%	Everything's alright, you're safe, we're your friends.
%illusion_world_14%	Seriously.
%illusion_world_15%	What the fuck is going on.
%illusion_world_16%	You're still in shock.
%illusion_world_17%	We'll take you home, make you a warm drink and talk this through, ok?
%illusion_world_18%	Don't do this to me, Fortuna, alright?
%illusion_world_19%	...Ok?
%junreisha_race_6%	I must confess that you surprised me when you decided to run for leader yourself instead of supporting Jasmine.
%junreisha_race_7%	But I am glad you opted to follow the wise path.
%junreisha_race_8%	We must devour Aedana.
%junreisha_race_11%	Good day to you too.
%junreisha_race_12%	Are we allies, then?
%junreisha_race_13%	I'm not doing this because of you.
%junreisha_race_17%	Good day to you too.
%junreisha_race_21%	Are we allies, then?
%junreisha_race_25%	I'm not doing this because of you.
%junreisha_race_29%	The question now is whether I should support you or Jasmine.
%junreisha_race_32%	Both of you want to keep the ban on the Forbidden Arts.
%junreisha_race_33%	And I believe that's a mistake.
%junreisha_race_34%	I tried to pressure Jasmine into changing her program, but that didn't work.
%junreisha_race_35%	My support could be very valuable. I have the means to sway the opinion of practically every academic.
%junreisha_race_36%	Are you willing to change your program to free access to the Forbidden Arts?
%junreisha_race_39%	No way. Forbidden Arts are too dangerous.
%junreisha_race_40%	Very well, if you bring every academic over to our side.
%junreisha_race_41%	What if I grant you exclusive access to the Forbidden Arts?
%junreisha_race_46%	No way. Forbidden Arts are too dangerous.
%junreisha_race_47%	Mmm...
%junreisha_race_48%	That's a pity. I'll stick with Jasmine, in that case.
%junreisha_race_49%	We've come a long way. I'm sure we'll find a way forward in the future.
%junreisha_race_50%	Couldn't we...?
%junreisha_race_51%	No.
%junreisha_race_52%	Goodbye.
%junreisha_race_60%	Very well, if you bring every academic over to our side.
%junreisha_race_61%	I can do that.
%junreisha_race_63%	I'll start persuading them immediately.
%junreisha_race_64%	See you in congress.
%junreisha_race_65%	Ah, ok, thank you.
%junreisha_race_66%	Goodbye.
%junreisha_race_72%	What if I grant you exclusive access to the Forbidden Arts?
%junreisha_race_73%	Oh.
%junreisha_race_74%	Mmm...
%junreisha_race_75%	That's even better.
%junreisha_race_76%	Ok, that's the deal, then. If you help me become the next leader, you'll have privileged access to your forbidden library.
%junreisha_race_77%	Very well.
%junreisha_race_78%	I know I can bring most of the academics over to our side.
%junreisha_race_82%	I have to admit that your proposal to grant free access to all Forbidden Arts really sweetens the deal.
%junreisha_race_83%	Devouring Aedana and then accessing that much knowledge and power...
%junreisha_race_84%	The future is bright.
%junreisha_race_85%	You only need to make sure I win this race, then.
%junreisha_race_86%	True.
%junreisha_race_87%	I can bring most of the academics over to our side.
%junreisha_race_92%	I have to admit that your plan to grant special permits to access the Forbidden Arts is very tempting...
%junreisha_race_93%	Devouring Aedana and then accessing that much knowledge and power...
%junreisha_race_94%	I really need that.
%junreisha_race_95%	The question is, will I have access to it?
%junreisha_race_96%	My support could be very valuable. I have the means to sway the opinion of practically every academic.
%junreisha_race_97%	Can you promise me one of those permits?
%junreisha_race_100%	Absolutely. Let's work together.
%junreisha_race_101%	I'm sorry, your case will be reviewed like everyone else's.
%junreisha_race_106%	Absolutely. Let's work together.
%junreisha_race_107%	You made the right choice.
%junreisha_race_108%	I know I can bring most of the academics over to our side.
%junreisha_race_112%	I'm sorry, your case will be reviewed like everyone else's.
%junreisha_race_113%	Why?
%junreisha_race_114%	Because we are not above any of our sisters.
%junreisha_race_115%	I'm sure that with your credentials you will be able to access the Forbidden Arts through the official channels.
%junreisha_race_116%	I see...
%junreisha_race_117%	It's not the ideal scenario, but it's still better than what Jasmine's offering.
%junreisha_race_118%	I'll stay on the sidelines, though. The only critical thing is to make sure Dahlia doesn't become the next leader.
%junreisha_race_119%	You can express that through your vote, like everyone else.
%junreisha_race_120%	Hah. Votes.
%junreisha_race_124%	Bold.
%junreisha_race_125%	Real bold.
%junreisha_race_126%	I salute your ambition.
%junreisha_race_127%	Good day to you too.
%junreisha_race_128%	I would never have thought to found my own political party and propose to devour Aedana all by myself.
%junreisha_race_129%	I must bow before your genius.
%junreisha_race_130%	Thank you?
%junreisha_race_131%	The only obstacle is how to make everyone actually vote for you.
%junreisha_race_132%	Ah, I have my ways.
%junreisha_race_133%	Maybe. I can make it easier, though.
%junreisha_race_134%	Oh yeah?
%junreisha_race_135%	However, you know how interested I was in devouring Aedana. To forego that opportunity I need to know it's all for something.
%junreisha_race_136%	To devour an Archwitch all by yourself, you may be crossing a threshold reserved for gods and Behemoths.
%junreisha_race_137%	I... don't mind backing up that experiment.
%junreisha_race_138%	But I need to know what your plans are.
%junreisha_race_139%	Depending on your answer, I could very well sway the opinion of every academic into supporting your cause.
%junreisha_race_140%	So, tell me, what do you plan to do should you become a god?
%junreisha_race_143%	Make everyone happy!
%junreisha_race_144%	Keep everything balanced and fair.
%junreisha_race_145%	Further our understanding of everything.
%junreisha_race_146%	Conquer every known world.
%junreisha_race_147%	Reset existence. Redefine the universe.
%junreisha_race_152%	Make everyone happy!
%junreisha_race_153%	Oh.
%junreisha_race_154%	Wow.
%junreisha_race_155%	I need to do everything I can to keep you from rising to power.
%junreisha_race_156%	What is wrong with happiness!?
%junreisha_race_158%	See you in congress.
%junreisha_race_163%	Keep everything balanced and fair.
%junreisha_race_164%	Mmm...
%junreisha_race_165%	I guess that there could be worse things.
%junreisha_race_166%	A waste of an opportunity, in my opinion.
%junreisha_race_167%	Why?
%junreisha_race_168%	Accessing the power of gods, only to change nothing.
%junreisha_race_169%	Moreover, to stop change!
%junreisha_race_170%	A fair world is a new world, in my opinion.
%junreisha_race_171%	Maybe.
%junreisha_race_172%	But not my cup of tea.
%junreisha_race_173%	I'm afraid I'll stay neutral in these elections.
%junreisha_race_174%	Very well.
%junreisha_race_179%	Further our understanding of everything.
%junreisha_race_180%	Now there's a god I could devote my life to.
%junreisha_race_181%	There's no higher cause than knowledge.
%junreisha_race_182%	I'm glad our visions align after all.
%junreisha_race_184%	I'm going to do everything in my power to get every academic to support your endeavor.
%junreisha_race_189%	Conquer every known world.
%junreisha_race_190%	Hah.
%junreisha_race_191%	Conquest.
%junreisha_race_192%	That's ludicrous.
%junreisha_race_193%	War is meaningless, Fortuna.
%junreisha_race_194%	The only true conquest is done through knowledge.
%junreisha_race_195%	Just kidding... I think.
%junreisha_race_196%	Even worse.
%junreisha_race_197%	This universe will only suffer if someone like you becomes a god.
%junreisha_race_198%	I'm going to do everything I can to stop you from rising to power.
%junreisha_race_203%	Reset existence. Redefine the universe.
%junreisha_race_204%	Oh.
%junreisha_race_205%	Not what I was expecting... but interesting, nonetheless.
%junreisha_race_206%	I don't even know if that's possible.
%junreisha_race_207%	But I believe it's worth pursuing.
%junreisha_race_208%	Maybe the only way to truly understand reality is to pull it apart and reassemble it anew.
%junreisha_race_209%	A worthy purpose.
%junreisha_race_213%	I see you chose the wrong side, in the end.
%junreisha_race_214%	Good day to you too.
%junreisha_race_215%	It's not just a matter of what to do with Aedana's corpse. Dahlia's program is absurdly naive.
%junreisha_race_216%	I totally misread your judgment.
%junreisha_race_217%	Well, I'm sorry you're not a fan of our plan, but it's the coven that will decide what kind of community they want to live in.
%junreisha_race_220%	So you didn't only choose the wrong side, you went as far as to found your own party just to make the same mistake.
%junreisha_race_221%	Good day to you too!
%junreisha_race_223%	I'm going to do everything in my power to stop you.
%junreisha_race_224%	Whoa, coming on strong.
%junreisha_race_225%	You came all this way just to declare war?
%junreisha_race_226%	Yes.
%junreisha_race_227%	Super.
%junreisha_race_228%	To begin with, you can forget about getting any votes from the academics. And then I'll start working on the other factions.
%junreisha_race_231%	Do your worst. We're not afraid.
%junreisha_race_232%	(Blackmail: threaten to reveal her secrets.)
%junreisha_race_233%	(Bribe: offer her access to Aedana's gift.)
%junreisha_race_234%	Can't we reach some kind of compromise?
%junreisha_race_239%	Do your worst. We're not afraid.
%junreisha_race_240%	You will be soon.
%junreisha_race_245%	You know, your beloved Aedana left me a parting present.
%junreisha_race_247%	She gave me one of her eyes, to peek beyond the fabric of reality.
%junreisha_race_248%	That's how I learnt your fatemancer's disk is rigged.
%junreisha_race_249%	And that you are collecting information from every Witch in a pinch without their knowledge or consent.
%junreisha_race_250%	...
%junreisha_race_251%	I'm sure it'd be a problem for your holistic research if this information became widespread.
%junreisha_race_252%	What do you want?
%junreisha_race_253%	Oh, I want absolutely nothing.
%junreisha_race_254%	You just need to do nothing, and your secret will be safe.
%junreisha_race_255%	...
%junreisha_race_256%	Very well. But I'm still voting for Jasmine.
%junreisha_race_257%	Completely understandable.
%junreisha_race_258%	You can leave now.
%junreisha_race_262%	What if I told you how to access Aedana's power, right here and now?
%junreisha_race_263%	...
%junreisha_race_264%	What are you getting at?
%junreisha_race_265%	Well, you see, Aedana's corpse paid me a visit and left me a parting gift.
%junreisha_race_267%	She gave me one of her golden seashells, through which I can channel her magic.
%junreisha_race_268%	Impossible. Why you, of all Witches?
%junreisha_race_269%	You're not ready to understand yet, I guess.
%junreisha_race_270%	But hear me out.
%junreisha_race_271%	What would you be willing to do to get access to Aedana's power?
%junreisha_race_272%	I'll be happy to share it with any of my allies.
%junreisha_race_273%	Mmm...
%junreisha_race_274%	I'm interested.
%junreisha_race_275%	What do you want?
%junreisha_race_278%	Remain neutral in this race.
%junreisha_race_279%	Bring the academics over to our side.
%junreisha_race_284%	Remain neutral in this race.
%junreisha_race_285%	Very well.
%junreisha_race_286%	I can do that.
%junreisha_race_288%	Draw an Ouroboros Octagon in your domains, inscribe my name in it, and I'll let the powers of the golden seashell flow through it.
%junreisha_race_289%	Understood. I will.
%junreisha_race_290%	Very well.
%junreisha_race_291%	You can leave now.
%junreisha_race_292%	...
%junreisha_race_298%	Bring the academics over to our side.
%junreisha_race_299%	Preposterous.
%junreisha_race_300%	What's the matter?
%junreisha_race_301%	You want access to Aedana's power right?
%junreisha_race_302%	It's here. Yours for the taking.
%junreisha_race_303%	Why bet on an uncertain race with so many different agents involved?
%junreisha_race_304%	...
%junreisha_race_305%	And even if Jasmine wins, you'll be sharing Aedana's power with a hundred other Witches.
%junreisha_race_306%	Even my golden seashell will be useless after that.
%junreisha_race_307%	This is your best shot at getting a bigger chunk of Aedana's magic.
%junreisha_race_308%	That is true.
%junreisha_race_309%	...
%junreisha_race_310%	Very well.
%junreisha_race_311%	I'll help you.
%junreisha_race_316%	Can't we reach some kind of compromise?
%junreisha_race_317%	No.
%junreisha_race_322%	I'm happy to see you chose the right side, in the end.
%junreisha_race_323%	I wasn't confident in our alliance materializing, based on the readings of the fatemancer's disk.
%junreisha_race_324%	But the cosmos is a capricious beast, so here we are.
%junreisha_race_325%	Happy to see you too.
%junreisha_race_330%	I have to admit it, including a permit system for the Forbidden Arts is a really nice edit to Jasmine's program.
%junreisha_race_331%	The combination of absorbing Aedana and having access to the forbidden library is going to be supremely powerful.
%junreisha_race_332%	I am nothing but thankful.
%junreisha_race_333%	Happy to see there's someone so enthusiastic about our program!
%junreisha_race_335%	What can I do for you?
%junreisha_race_336%	Oh, no.
%junreisha_race_337%	I come for the opposite. To see how I can help you achieve victory.
%junreisha_race_338%	Ah, great.
%junreisha_race_339%	What do you need me to do to further your dominance in this race?
%junreisha_race_342%	Aren't you a respected academic? Bring them over to our side.
%junreisha_race_343%	Is there a way to gain the trust of the warriors?
%junreisha_race_344%	Can you spare some energy to fund this race?
%junreisha_race_345%	Nothing. Really. Just vote for us.
%junreisha_race_350%	Aren't you a respected academic? Bring them over to our side.
%junreisha_race_351%	Absolutely, I can do that.
%junreisha_race_352%	Thank you so much. Our efforts are spread a bit thin, so this is a huge help.
%junreisha_race_353%	It'll be my pleasure.
%junreisha_race_354%	You'll receive news soon.
%junreisha_race_355%	Godspeed.
%junreisha_race_361%	Is there a way to gain the trust of the warriors?
%junreisha_race_362%	Oh, mmm...
%junreisha_race_363%	That's a tough bone to gnaw at, especially going against Dahlia.
%junreisha_race_364%	I know, but we're desperate for any angle on that front.
%junreisha_race_365%	I do have some strings to pull.
%junreisha_race_366%	It's definitely not going to be decisive, but it should be enough to win over some of them.
%junreisha_race_367%	We can work with that.
%junreisha_race_368%	Very well.
%junreisha_race_369%	I'll let you know how it goes.
%junreisha_race_370%	Thank you so much.
%junreisha_race_371%	Anything to help you build a powerful coven.
%junreisha_race_376%	Can you spare some energy to fund this race?
%junreisha_race_377%	Absolutely.
%junreisha_race_378%	A small price to pay to access Aedana's power.
%junreisha_race_379%	Here, I'll open my nodes.
%junreisha_race_381%	Oh, that's pretty generous of you.
%junreisha_race_382%	I'm only sorry that there's barely any Water energy in it, but it's not my forte.
%junreisha_race_383%	Oh, I get you, believe me.
%junreisha_race_384%	This is more than enough. Thank you so much.
%junreisha_race_385%	Anything to help you build a powerful coven.
%junreisha_race_386%	I'll take my leave now.
%junreisha_race_387%	I need to recover some strength.
%junreisha_race_388%	Thank you, again.
%junreisha_race_392%	Nothing. Really. Just vote for us.
%junreisha_race_393%	How reassuring. You've really got this, haven't you?
%junreisha_race_394%	But please, don't lower your guard.
%junreisha_race_395%	Just know that you have an ally here.
%junreisha_race_396%	I appreciate that.
%junreisha_race_397%	We won't disappoint you.
%junreisha_race_398%	Thank you for your support.
%kurielle_2_2%	Better?
%kurielle_2_3%	Where did everything go!?
%kurielle_2_4%	Don't worry, everything's still in its place, I just altered our senses.
%kurielle_2_5%	Whoa, I love this. I wish I could do this!
%kurielle_2_6%	It would have made being exiled so much easier to bear...
%kurielle_2_8%	Ah... funny you mention that, because I came to see you precisely to discuss my talents...
%kurielle_2_9%	What's the matter?
%kurielle_2_10%	Well, sensorial magic makes a great party trick, but beyond that I feel pretty useless.
%kurielle_2_13%	Shut up! Sensorial magic is super cool!
%kurielle_2_14%	Oh... That's your only talent?
%kurielle_2_18%	Shut up! Sensorial magic is super cool!
%kurielle_2_19%	Yeah... But cool doesn't earn you much respect in this community.
%kurielle_2_20%	And I understand why, I mean...
%kurielle_2_24%	Oh... That's your only talent?
%kurielle_2_25%	...
%kurielle_2_26%	Yes...
%kurielle_2_28%	I can't affect reality in any way.
%kurielle_2_30%	After several centuries I've come to terms with it, really, but...
%kurielle_2_32%	From time to time, imposter syndrome kicks in.
%kurielle_2_33%	What? Is that a thing Witches can feel?
%kurielle_2_34%	Like... I mean, you're a Witch. You're immortal and you fly across outer space.
%kurielle_2_35%	There's no doubt about you being a Witch.
%kurielle_2_37%	Yeah... but you know what I mean.
%kurielle_2_38%	I'm a one trick pony.
%kurielle_2_40%	And that trick isn't really going to have any impact on the cosmos... literally.
%kurielle_2_41%	I don't see it like that but...
%kurielle_2_42%	I can't possibly understand. You're the one who's been struggling with this for centuries.
%kurielle_2_44%	No need to pity me, though!
%kurielle_2_45%	I mean, I have a pretty good life, magical frustrations aside.
%kurielle_2_46%	Oh, not at all. From my perspective your powers are incredible!
%kurielle_2_47%	Haha, thank you.
%kurielle_2_48%	What about you? How do you feel about your powers? You're an oracle, right?
%kurielle_2_51%	I'm pretty comfortable with them.
%kurielle_2_52%	I wish it was something more spectacular.
%kurielle_2_53%	Ah... Too much responsibility.
%kurielle_2_57%	I'm pretty comfortable with them.
%kurielle_2_58%	Oh, yeah?
%kurielle_2_59%	Yeah, I mean, I was into divination even before I ascended.
%kurielle_2_60%	It's second nature to me.
%kurielle_2_62%	That's so cool, I wish I could feel so in sync with my talents.
%kurielle_2_63%	Actually, I came to see you about that.
%kurielle_2_67%	I wish it was something more spectacular.
%kurielle_2_68%	Oh! But peeking into the future is spectacular!
%kurielle_2_69%	Conceptually, maybe. But it's not flashy at all.
%kurielle_2_70%	Bah, flashy is overrated.
%kurielle_2_71%	The tension of capturing someone's attention while shuffling your deck...
%kurielle_2_72%	That's true showmanship!
%kurielle_2_73%	Oh... I never thought of it that way.
%kurielle_2_74%	I do feel cooler now, haha.
%kurielle_2_76%	Haha... actually, I came to see you about this.
%kurielle_2_80%	Ah... Too much responsibility.
%kurielle_2_81%	Responsibility?
%kurielle_2_82%	I do envy how inconsequential your magic can be.
%kurielle_2_84%	Ouch.
%kurielle_2_85%	Haha, sorry, I told you I was in the awkward club too.
%kurielle_2_87%	It's alright, I feel more comfortable among fellow weirdos.
%kurielle_2_88%	You're in the right place then, haha.
%kurielle_2_90%	Now that you've told me that, I feel bad about the favor I was about to ask for.
%kurielle_2_91%	What is it?
%kurielle_2_94%	I've heard wonders about your new deck, so I wanted to ask you to help me find a way to make myself useful.
%kurielle_2_97%	It'll be my pleasure!
%kurielle_2_98%	(Warn her about the risks first.)
%kurielle_2_102%	Mmm...
%kurielle_2_103%	I should warn you about the risks first.
%kurielle_2_104%	Oh? What risks?
%kurielle_2_107%	Observing our future may alter it.
%kurielle_2_108%	(Tell her the whole truth.)
%kurielle_2_109%	(On second thought, I should just refuse.)
%kurielle_2_113%	Observing our future may alter it.
%kurielle_2_114%	Well, that's exactly what I want!
%kurielle_2_115%	Whatever we find in my cards may determine your new path.
%kurielle_2_116%	Sign me up!
%kurielle_2_117%	I need a change, I don't mind what kind. I'll take it from there.
%kurielle_2_118%	Alright! In that case, let's begin the reading.
%kurielle_2_123%	I just recently discovered that I'm not exactly a soothsayer.
%kurielle_2_124%	I'm a... writer. I determine fate through my cards.
%kurielle_2_126%	What does that mean?
%kurielle_2_127%	I can alter reality, both past and future.
%kurielle_2_128%	You will be basically granting me access to rewrite your existence.
%kurielle_2_129%	Oh...
%kurielle_2_130%	Wow...
%kurielle_2_131%	That means I can totally help you find you a higher purpose for your sensorial arts.
%kurielle_2_132%	But you must be aware that it's not exactly divination.
%kurielle_2_133%	...
%kurielle_2_134%	Mmm...
%kurielle_2_137%	I'll pass then.
%kurielle_2_138%	Oh.
%kurielle_2_139%	It's too much. Thanks for warning me beforehand.
%kurielle_2_140%	Is... mmm... is the coven aware of the nature of your talents?
%kurielle_2_141%	Not yet, I'm still learning about them myself. Why?
%kurielle_2_142%	Nothing. Just curious.
%kurielle_2_143%	Anyway! I should be leaving now. I'm sure you must be really busy with the race!
%kurielle_2_144%	I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you in the end.
%kurielle_2_145%	Don't worry! It was really nice meeting you!
%kurielle_2_146%	And good luck with everything!
%kurielle_2_147%	Thank you!
%kurielle_2_152%	Mmm... Look... I'm so sorry, but on second thought, I think it's better if we don't do this?
%kurielle_2_154%	Uh... Why? What happened?
%kurielle_2_155%	My divination is too... heavy. I'm sure there are better ways to discover a use for your powers.
%kurielle_2_156%	Try some other oracle, or... have you considered mediation?
%kurielle_2_159%	Alright, I can take a hint.
%kurielle_2_160%	Just say you don't feel like it and that's it.
%kurielle_2_161%	Ah... It's not that...
%kurielle_2_162%	Don't worry. I know how to take a no.
%kurielle_2_163%	You must be really busy with the race and everything, so I'll leave you to it.
%kurielle_2_164%	Kurielle, I'm sorry I couldn't help you in the end...
%kurielle_2_165%	Bye!
%kurielle_2_170%	It'll be my pleasure!
%kurielle_2_172%	What do you have in mind, exactly?
%kurielle_2%	Hi!
%kurielle_3%	Hi! Welcome!
%kurielle_4%	This place is so cool!
%kurielle_5%	Thanks!
%kurielle_6%	I wouldn't mind being imprisoned here!
%kurielle_7%	Eh...
%kurielle_9%	Oh, shit! I'm so sorry!
%kurielle_10%	Right off the bat, my big mouth ruining everything.
%kurielle_11%	Ah... It's alright.
%kurielle_12%	It's my personal curse, always making things awkward.
%kurielle_13%	Really, don't worry. I'm awkward in my own way, too.
%kurielle_15%	Ah... ok...
%kurielle_16%	But let me tell you, you wouldn't like spending 200 years here.
%kurielle_17%	I'm so sick of these walls.
%kurielle_18%	Oh... I know! Let me make up for it!
%nova_ally_3%	Hellooo!
%nova_ally_4%	Hey, welcome back.
%nova_ally_5%	How are you doing?
%nova_ally_15%	Living my best Witch life.
%nova_ally_16%	Yeah?
%nova_ally_18%	You bet.
%nova_ally_19%	As you predicted, or maybe inspired by your prediction, I got super into growing magical peppers.
%nova_ally_20%	Witch gardening is so much fun, especially if you can timeskip and see a whole plant grow in a matter of minutes!
%nova_ally_21%	Oh, some Witches believe that time is a super important ingredient when growing stuff, and that a timeskip hinders the qualities of the harvest.
%nova_ally_23%	Oh, yeah?
%nova_ally_24%	I'll research more about that, then...
%nova_ally_26%	But still, the Lust Reapers are spreading furor amidst our coven as we speak.
%nova_ally_27%	You got to them this fast!?
%nova_ally_29%	Oh, yeah, and they work wonders!
%nova_ally_31%	Here, I brought you some.
%nova_ally_32%	Wow, thank you.
%nova_ally_33%	I'm not sure if I'll get to use them.
%nova_ally_34%	But it's good to have some around, I guess.
%nova_ally_35%	Even just by yourself they make for the most intense session... if you know what I mean.
%nova_ally_36%	Ahem.
%nova_ally_37%	Let's change the subject.
%nova_ally_41%	I'm having a lot of fun!
%nova_ally_42%	Yeah?
%nova_ally_44%	Yes! Some novices helped me find my own garden, and I started working immediately.
%nova_ally_45%	Actually, according to your prediction, or maybe inspired by your prediction, I got to develop the Truth Chili!
%nova_ally_47%	So fast!?
%nova_ally_49%	Oh, Witch gardening is so much fun, especially if you can timeskip and see a whole plant grow in a matter of minutes!
%nova_ally_50%	I'm glad you're having fun. And they work, these Truth Chili?
%nova_ally_52%	You bet.
%nova_ally_54%	Got together with some novices for an innocent game of truth or dare and things got out of hand pretty quickly, hahaha.
%nova_ally_56%	I thought they could be an interesting ingredient to add to these elections.
%nova_ally_57%	Imagine if every candidate ate one of these before every debate.
%nova_ally_59%	Wouldn't that be great?
%nova_ally_60%	Mmm... maybe.
%nova_ally_62%	Ah... of course, politics may be more complex than just that, but I thought...
%nova_ally_63%	I mean, it's completely up to you.
%nova_ally_64%	Do you want me to present this to the elders and propose we use them for the debates?
%nova_ally_67%	Ok. Let's do it.
%nova_ally_68%	Ah... I'd rather not.
%nova_ally_73%	Ok. Let's do it.
%nova_ally_75%	Yes!!!
%nova_ally_76%	I just hope this doesn't backfire, haha.
%nova_ally_78%	Nothing to worry about if you've got nothing to hide, right?
%nova_ally_79%	Ha, ha... right.
%nova_ally_80%	Next time I go out I'll present this to the elders and see if we can introduce them to the debates.
%nova_ally_81%	Ok. Besides that...
%nova_ally_85%	Ah... I'd rather not.
%nova_ally_86%	Ah... ok.
%nova_ally_87%	Things aren't as simple as telling the truth without a filter.
%nova_ally_88%	There are many intricacies to navigate, especially when it comes to politics.
%nova_ally_90%	Nah... I understand.
%nova_ally_91%	It was pretty naive of me, sorry.
%nova_ally_92%	But who knows, maybe they'll come in handy sometime in the future, right?
%nova_ally_93%	Of course. There can never be too many magical tools to deal with what this universe throws at us.
%nova_ally_94%	Keep up the good work.
%nova_ally_95%	Thank you.
%nova_ally_96%	So... Besides gardening...
%nova_ally_100%	Very good, very good.
%nova_ally_101%	Yeah?
%nova_ally_103%	Yes, way better than I expected, to be honest.
%nova_ally_104%	It took me a while to realize I wasn't dreaming, but once I connected with what magic is and how I can interact with the cosmos...
%nova_ally_106%	I feel unstoppable!
%nova_ally_107%	I've never felt this alive.
%nova_ally_108%	I'm so happy for you!
%nova_ally_109%	It's thanks to you that I got this far this quick.
%nova_ally_111%	What you read in the cards for me... it profoundly affected me.
%nova_ally_112%	Your words have been fueling my passion for the cosmic arts.
%nova_ally_114%	So much that I've had praise from the whole coven, including the elders!
%nova_ally_115%	They say they've never seen someone as promising as me in the whole history of the coven!!
%nova_ally_116%	Oh, wow, that's big!
%nova_ally_117%	Congratulations, I'm so happy for you.
%nova_ally_119%	Thank you so much. I could never repay what you've done for me.
%nova_ally_120%	Actually, about that...
%nova_ally_125%	Well... being a Witch is tougher than I thought, to be honest.
%nova_ally_126%	Why's that?
%nova_ally_128%	I mean, having magical powers, being immortal and being able to fly across the universe... that is... just too good.
%nova_ally_130%	What's hard is navigating Witch society...
%nova_ally_131%	Oh... I get you.
%nova_ally_132%	What you foretold is actually happening.
%nova_ally_133%	For some reason, showing promise is something that bothers too many Witches.
%nova_ally_134%	I would never have thought that people would be this sour even when they've got the whole cosmos at their disposal.
%nova_ally_136%	Anyway, it's not like I didn't make any friends.
%nova_ally_137%	But, come on...
%nova_ally_138%	I'm sorry. It'll get easier with time.
%nova_ally_139%	Give it a couple of centuries and the dust will settle.
%nova_ally_141%	What!?
%nova_ally_142%	Haha, I'm kidding.
%nova_ally_144%	Hahaha.
%nova_ally_146%	Not funny, actually.
%nova_ally_147%	Sorry, sorry.
%nova_ally_148%	But you know, being immortal makes you get used to -- and bored of -- almost anything.
%nova_ally_149%	You'll get over it. Just focus on surrounding yourself with Witches you get along with.
%nova_ally_150%	Yeah... speaking of that.
%nova_ally_155%	Well... you were dead right.
%nova_ally_156%	My first few weeks as a Witch have been quite an ordeal.
%nova_ally_157%	The elders giving you much headache?
%nova_ally_159%	They're ruthless and insatiable.
%nova_ally_160%	They've had me summoning spirits, dispeling magical locks, harvesting energy... you name it.
%nova_ally_161%	And how are you faring so far?
%nova_ally_162%	Well, you know the answer to that question already.
%nova_ally_165%	They're tearing me a new one.
%nova_ally_166%	It's like they get off on my failures or something.
%nova_ally_167%	I know they're just using me to make a point against scattering Aedana's remains and welcoming more novices but...
%nova_ally_169%	Give me a break.
%nova_ally_170%	I'm sorry you got caught up in this election nonsense.
%nova_ally_172%	It's alright, it beats being depressed in my apartment on Earth, I guess.
%nova_ally_173%	I'll do my best to turn this coven into a place where you can be happy.
%nova_ally_175%	You're the best. Thank you so much.
%nova_ally_177%	And speaking of which...
%nova_ally_181%	I'm fucking killing it, hahaha.
%nova_ally_182%	Yeah? That good?
%nova_ally_184%	You bet. I was born to be a cosmic Witch.
%nova_ally_186%	Summoning? How many?
%nova_ally_187%	Magical locks? Easy-peasy.
%nova_ally_188%	Harvesting energy? They had to stop me so I wouldn't dry out their dominion.
%nova_ally_189%	I even got them to try my freshly grown Euphoria Peppers and had both elders and novices cheering while I cast some fireworks.
%nova_ally_190%	Come on. That can't be true.
%nova_ally_192%	The news will reach you eventually, haha.
%nova_ally_194%	Their plan to discredit novices to dissuade our sisters from scattering Aedana's remains definitely backfired.
%nova_ally_196%	Sorry if that clashes with your plans or anything.
%nova_ally_197%	But I couldn't just let them walk all over me.
%nova_ally_198%	No, no, don't worry. I'm so proud of you.
%nova_ally_200%	Thank you!!
%nova_ally_202%	Actually, I wanted you to ask you something...
%nova_ally_206%	How are you settling in?
%nova_ally_208%	Well, I'm still trying to find my place.
%nova_ally_209%	Magic, understanding the cosmos, and all that... Well, that's a thing.
%nova_ally_211%	But I can't help feeling lonely.
%nova_ally_212%	How so?
%nova_ally_213%	I don't know, I don't feel like I belong in this coven yet...
%nova_ally_214%	I'd like to be part of a project or something.
%nova_ally_215%	I see...
%nova_ally_217%	That's actually why I'm here.
%nova_ally_218%	You just tell me frankly if it'd be too much of a nuisance but...
%nova_ally_220%	I'd like to join your party... please?
%nova_ally_221%	I'll do anything. Grabbing cosmic coffee, or whatever the equivalent is in this case.
%nova_ally_222%	I just want to help in any way I can.
%nova_ally_223%	Oh, that's so nice of you.
%nova_ally_225%	So... Will you have me on board?
%nova_ally_228%	Of course, we'd be thrilled to have you!
%nova_ally_229%	Ah... You don't want to be tangled up in politics.
%nova_ally_233%	Of course, we'd be thrilled to have you!
%nova_ally_235%	Yes!!!
%nova_ally_238%	Thank you so much for this opportunity, Fortuna.
%nova_ally_239%	You won't regret it.
%nova_ally_240%	I'm gonna do my best and then some!
%nova_ally_241%	That's a good attitude.
%nova_ally_242%	You're already in our headquarters so... Find a comfortable spot and I'll come up with something for you to help us with!
%nova_ally_244%	Understood!
%nova_ally_250%	Ah... You don't want to be tangled up in politics.
%nova_ally_251%	Oh...
%nova_ally_252%	I promise I won't bother you.
%nova_ally_253%	I'd be happy just watching and learning.
%nova_ally_254%	You won't even notice I'm here, I swear.
%nova_ally_255%	...
%nova_ally_257%	Please, Fortuna, give me a chance. This is important to me.
%nova_ally_260%	Very well, if that's what you want.
%nova_ally_261%	I'm sorry, but no.
%nova_ally_265%	Very well, if that's what you want.
%nova_ally_267%	Yes!!!
%nova_ally_268%	But this is no game, and it'll be tough.
%nova_ally_270%	Absolutely, I understand.
%nova_ally_274%	I'm sorry, but no.
%nova_ally_275%	The stakes are too high.
%nova_ally_277%	...
%nova_ally_279%	Ok. I understand.
%nova_ally_280%	Had to give it a shot, right?
%nova_ally_281%	Your time will come. I'm sure you will accomplish great things.
%nova_ally_282%	You've barely started your new life. Focus on developing your arts first.
%nova_ally_283%	That's good advice, as always.
%nova_ally_284%	Thank you, Fortuna. I will turn into someone you can depend on.
%nova_ally_285%	I'm sure you will.
%nova_ally_286%	Thank you so much for listening to me, and good luck with the race!
%nova_ally_287%	Thank you! Take care!
%nova_arbiter_3%	Hello!
%nova_arbiter_4%	Well, that was fast.
%nova_arbiter_5%	What happened?
%nova_arbiter_7%	I enrolled.
%nova_arbiter_8%	Yes, but why? What have you done?
%nova_arbiter_9%	How did you manage to break the Magical Pact so soon?
%nova_arbiter_11%	Hahaha, I didn't break anything.
%nova_arbiter_13%	I decided to join up of my own accord.
%nova_arbiter_15%	I tried so hard to enjoy my new Witch life and not think too much about your prediction, but...
%nova_arbiter_16%	I started to get so anxious. I thought having to serve as an arbiter was like going to prison or something.
%nova_arbiter_18%	So, just to clear my mind, I visited the Moon Temple to get a glimpse of what being an arbiter would be like.
%nova_arbiter_20%	And it totally rules!
%nova_arbiter_21%	Seriously, it's super cool.
%nova_arbiter_23%	To begin with, this uniform has thirteen different types of counterspell woven into its fabric.
%nova_arbiter_24%	You could blast me with a fire torrent and I wouldn't feel a thing.
%nova_arbiter_26%	And the Moon Temple archives are enormous! I don't think I could read through all of them in two whole Witch lives.
%nova_arbiter_28%	The best part is that I'll get to travel a lot and learn about many cosmic cultures while I mediate in intergalactic conflicts.
%nova_arbiter_29%	It's every nerd's wet dream.
%nova_arbiter_32%	Whoa, now I want to enroll too.
%nova_arbiter_33%	I'm so sorry I pushed you to this.
%nova_arbiter_34%	...So now I know an arbiter who owes me?
%nova_arbiter_38%	Whoa, now I want to enroll too.
%nova_arbiter_40%	Hahahaha.
%nova_arbiter_42%	We could partner up and solve magical crimes together!
%nova_arbiter_43%	Sounds like a dream, really.
%nova_arbiter_44%	But I guess I'm a politician now.
%nova_arbiter_46%	Oh, right.
%nova_arbiter_50%	I'm so sorry I pushed you to this.
%nova_arbiter_51%	Didn't you hear everything I just said?
%nova_arbiter_52%	Intergalactic conflicts. Cosmic cultures.
%nova_arbiter_53%	Really, it beats absolute freedom.
%nova_arbiter_55%	It was awful enough as a mortal to have to decide what to do with my life.
%nova_arbiter_56%	Multiply that by the scale of being immortal in space.
%nova_arbiter_58%	To have a destiny and fulfill it so easily... you've offered me a great gift, Fortuna.
%nova_arbiter_59%	Well, I guess I'm happy for you, then?
%nova_arbiter_61%	You'd better be.
%nova_arbiter_65%	...So now I know an arbiter who owes me?
%nova_arbiter_67%	Ah... I guess so?
%nova_arbiter_68%	Although it goes against the code of the Arbitrage Office to favor any specific party.
%nova_arbiter_71%	Relax. I'm just kidding.
%nova_arbiter_72%	Just put a bit of pressure on our opponents, please?
%nova_arbiter_76%	Relax. I'm just kidding.
%nova_arbiter_77%	Haha... of course.
%nova_arbiter_79%	How are you doing, by the way?
%nova_arbiter_84%	Just put a bit of pressure on our opponents, please?
%nova_arbiter_85%	What do you mean...?
%nova_arbiter_86%	Nothing unethical. I mean, do your job and investigate them for any irregularities.
%nova_arbiter_87%	Ok... I guess I can do that.
%nova_arbiter_88%	But after that we're square, alright?
%nova_arbiter_89%	Absolutely. I just want to make sure we set this coven on the right path.
%nova_arbiter_90%	I understand...
%nova_arbiter_92%	And about that...
%nova_arbiter_96%	How's the race going?
%nova_arbiter_99%	Too soon to tell.
%nova_arbiter_100%	We're gonna win this, for sure.
%nova_arbiter_101%	I don't know if we can pull this off, honestly.
%nova_arbiter_102%	I don't really care.
%nova_arbiter_106%	Too soon to tell.
%nova_arbiter_107%	Our opponents are well prepared. We need to put up a good fight and even then nothing's guaranteed.
%nova_arbiter_108%	I see...
%nova_arbiter_112%	We're gonna win this, for sure.
%nova_arbiter_114%	Is that conviction or prediction?
%nova_arbiter_115%	Who knows. More like a self pep-talk?
%nova_arbiter_117%	Hahahaha.
%nova_arbiter_119%	Well, I know you've got this.
%nova_arbiter_123%	I don't know if we can pull this off, honestly.
%nova_arbiter_124%	How so?
%nova_arbiter_125%	I don't know, it's just too much to handle.
%nova_arbiter_126%	Aw, come on.
%nova_arbiter_127%	You've got this, Fortuna.
%nova_arbiter_131%	I don't really care.
%nova_arbiter_132%	Really?
%nova_arbiter_133%	Why are you doing it, then?
%nova_arbiter_134%	Some exogenous force is compelling me to follow through.
%nova_arbiter_135%	I don't really know.
%nova_arbiter_137%	Ok...?
%nova_arbiter_139%	You oracle Witches are hard to follow.
%nova_arbiter_140%	Heh, yeah. I can barely follow myself.
%nova_arbiter_144%	Well, I wish you good luck!
%nova_arbiter_147%	Although what I really feel is sorry for your opponents.
%nova_arbiter_148%	From what I've seen, the only safe place in this coven is by your side.
%nova_arbiter_151%	I'm sure these must be trying times for you, but...
%nova_arbiter_152%	Just... do your best. I'm sure the coven will be fine whoever ends up being in charge!
%nova_arbiter_155%	You are the best Witch I've met in my short cosmic existence!
%nova_arbiter_156%	I'm rooting for you. I can't wait for everyone to see how amazing you are!
%nova_arbiter_158%	Thank you.
%nova_arbiter_159%	Take care. Enjoy your new life.
%nova_arbiter_160%	I'm going to make this universe a better place.
%nova_arbiter_161%	Thanks again for everything.
%rangimarie_poem_3%	THIS IS A MASTERPIECE.
%rangimarie_poem_4%	Are you feeling it!?
%rangimarie_poem_7%	OOOH! I LOVE IT!!!
%rangimarie_poem_8%	Yeah, it's nice.
%rangimarie_poem_9%	I like it, but I don't really get it.
%rangimarie_poem_10%	Cosmic poetry is definitely not for me.
%rangimarie_poem_14%	OOOH! I LOVE IT!!!
%rangimarie_poem_15%	Right!??
%rangimarie_poem_16%	It's going to be a sensation!!
%rangimarie_poem_19%	I'm going to start singing it throughout the universe right now!!
%rangimarie_poem_20%	Yeah, please.
%rangimarie_poem_21%	It totally conveys what you're doing here, trust me.
%rangimarie_poem_23%	I'm out, good luck with the rest of the race!
%rangimarie_poem_24%	Thank you for coming, and for the poem!
%rangimarie_poem_29%	Yeah, it's nice.
%rangimarie_poem_30%	Nice? This is incredible, Fortuna.
%rangimarie_poem_31%	You may not be well versed in cosmic poetry, but this is going to be a massive hit, you'll see.
%rangimarie_poem_32%	Alright! I'm happy then!
%rangimarie_poem_36%	I like it, but I don't really get it.
%rangimarie_poem_37%	With that incredible sinker you sealed it with, that's only normal. It may be sinking for a couple of days, even!
%rangimarie_poem_38%	But it'll get to you, trust me!
%rangimarie_poem_39%	This is a hit, Fortuna.
%rangimarie_poem_40%	Yeah?
%rangimarie_poem_41%	Ok, then! Success!
%rangimarie_poem_45%	Cosmic poetry is definitely not for me.
%rangimarie_poem_46%	Not working?
%rangimarie_poem_47%	Even with a substance this good!?
%rangimarie_poem_48%	Well, I'm sorry to hear that. But believe me, this is going to be a massive hit.
%rangimarie_poem_49%	This is the best shit I've ever cast.
%rangimarie_poem_50%	It's so good it feels like cheating.
%rangimarie_poem_51%	Alright...?
%rangimarie_poem_52%	Well, I hope the novices like it!
%rangimarie_poem_53%	It's going to blow their minds.
%rangimarie_2%	Ah, what a nice home!
%rangimarie_4%	Did you like the cosmic poem I sent you?
%rangimarie_7%	Yeah! Thank you very much.
%rangimarie_8%	Sure... It was nice.
%rangimarie_9%	Not really, if I'm honest.
%rangimarie_10%	Oh, was that a poem?
%rangimarie_14%	Yeah! Thank you very much.
%rangimarie_17%	Sure... It was nice.
%rangimarie_20%	Not really, if I'm honest.
%rangimarie_23%	Oh, was that a poem?
%rangimarie_27%	Oh, you're welcome!
%rangimarie_30%	Let it sink in, it'll grow on you.
%rangimarie_31%	Nice.
%rangimarie_32%	So...
%rangimarie_35%	What do you want?
%rangimarie_36%	To what do I owe the pleasure?
%rangimarie_37%	Can I help you with anything?
%rangimarie_38%	Mmm...
%rangimarie_42%	Shhh!
%rangimarie_43%	Let it sink in.
%rangimarie_44%	Inside your mind, there's a kaleidoscope.
%rangimarie_45%	I...
%rangimarie_46%	It's still sinking.
%rangimarie_47%	...
%rangimarie_49%	Refracting every possible path.
%rangimarie_50%	Pay attention.
%rangimarie_51%	...
%rangimarie_53%	...
%rangimarie_54%	...
%rangimarie_55%	Well?
%rangimarie_58%	...And I am the roadkeeper?
%rangimarie_59%	It's supposed to kick in now?
%rangimarie_60%	Oh, yes, very good, I feel it, very deep.
%rangimarie_61%	Why are you here?
%rangimarie_65%	...And I am the roadkeeper?
%rangimarie_68%	It's supposed to kick in now?
%rangimarie_71%	Oh, yes, very good, I feel it, very deep.
%rangimarie_73%	Powerful, huh?
%rangimarie_76%	Why are you here?
%rangimarie_79%	Look... I don't want to be rude, I'd normally enjoy this kind of weird game, but we're a bit swamped at the moment with the coming elections.
%rangimarie_80%	So... What can I do for you?
%rangimarie_83%	I WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR CAUSE!
%rangimarie_84%	Oh! Ok!
%rangimarie_85%	You're not from our coven, though, right?
%rangimarie_86%	Why did you decide to support us?
%rangimarie_87%	I like your team. I'd like for you to be in power.
%rangimarie_88%	Thank you! What is it that you find interesting about our program?
%rangimarie_90%	Mmm...
%rangimarie_92%	The Vibe.
%rangimarie_93%	I see...
%rangimarie_94%	And what were you thinking in terms of... mmm... support?
%rangimarie_96%	Why a cosmic poem, of course.
%rangimarie_97%	Oh, I heard they're all the rage among the younger Witches, right?
%rangimarie_98%	Yes.
%rangimarie_99%	And soon among every Witch, once I manage to break through their sour skepticism.
%rangimarie_101%	Cosmic poetry is not just about the words!
%rangimarie_102%	They're thought-birthing spells! But they can only penetrate welcoming minds.
%rangimarie_103%	(Oh, ok, so that's why it wasn't doing anything for me... I guess?)
%rangimarie_105%	Unlike traditional art, they need your consent to make an impact.
%rangimarie_107%	It's the most ethical form of creation!
%rangimarie_108%	Ok... interesting concept.
%rangimarie_109%	And you're saying that you'd like to compose a cosmic poem to boost our campaign?
%rangimarie_111%	That's it!
%rangimarie_112%	I would only require 5 units of every element: 5 of Fire, 5 of Water, 5 of Air, and 5 of Earth.
%rangimarie_115%	Deal!
%rangimarie_116%	Oh, so you're looking for work.
%rangimarie_117%	The optics of buying off a celebrity, though...
%rangimarie_121%	Deal!
%rangimarie_126%	Meteoric!
%rangimarie_131%	Wait... there's not enough magic here.
%rangimarie_132%	I'm sorry, that's everything I've got left...
%rangimarie_133%	Oh, no!
%rangimarie_134%	I didn't come here to rip you off, I swear.
%rangimarie_135%	I'll cover the rest and you can pay off the balance whenever it's a good time for you.
%rangimarie_136%	Ah, ok... Thank you.
%rangimarie_137%	Ok, now...
%rangimarie_140%	Let's compose a cosmic poem!
%rangimarie_145%	Oh, so you're looking for work.
%rangimarie_146%	Oh, no, no, no.
%rangimarie_147%	Not at all.
%rangimarie_151%	The optics of buying off a celebrity, though...
%rangimarie_152%	Whaaat? Buying off? What an ugly concept.
%rangimarie_153%	That's not at all what's going on here.
%rangimarie_154%	I genuinely want to support you, of my own accord.
%rangimarie_156%	The thing is, as I said, cosmic poems are actually spells, so they need magic to be crafted.
%rangimarie_157%	I'm only requiring you to cover the costs of the enchantment, I won't be making any profit.
%rangimarie_160%	Sounds reasonable. Ok. Let's do it.
%rangimarie_161%	Why not use your own magic?
%rangimarie_162%	I don't like this, I'm gonna pass.
%rangimarie_166%	Sounds reasonable. Ok. Let's do it.
%rangimarie_170%	I don't like this, I'm gonna pass.
%rangimarie_171%	But... why?
%rangimarie_172%	Hiring an influencer to affect vote intention doesn't sit well with me.
%rangimarie_173%	Ah... again... you wouldn't be "hiring" me.
%rangimarie_177%	Why not use your own magic?
%rangimarie_178%	I mean, if you really believe in our cause and want us to succeed, you can help without requiring any payment, right?
%rangimarie_179%	Again, it's not a payment, it's just the magic required for the poem to come into existence.
%rangimarie_180%	I understand that part, but it'd be better if you use your own magic, because otherwise we're basically hiring an influencer to affect vote intention.
%rangimarie_182%	But even if that was the case, what's so wrong about an endorsement deal with a cosmic celebrity?
%rangimarie_185%	That's outright mass manipulation.
%rangimarie_186%	Politics should be about the program, not popularity.
%rangimarie_187%	It just feels wrong, I don't want to do it.
%rangimarie_188%	Look, let's cut the crap, I just want it cheaper.
%rangimarie_192%	That's outright mass manipulation.
%rangimarie_193%	Oh. Wow.
%rangimarie_194%	I don't see it that way, but I'm always open to being educated.
%rangimarie_195%	How is it different from all the campaign efforts that you're doing? Aren't you, in a way, "mass manipulating" your community too?
%rangimarie_198%	We promote our agenda, not our personas.
%rangimarie_199%	Admiration clouds judgment.
%rangimarie_200%	Mmm... ok, you got me.
%rangimarie_204%	Politics should be about the program, not popularity.
%rangimarie_205%	Ah... I understand your concern here.
%rangimarie_206%	However, is it really just about the program?
%rangimarie_210%	We promote our agenda, not our personas.
%rangimarie_211%	Mmm... I don't think of those things as separate concepts, really.
%rangimarie_213%	You need to be aware that people are going to choose a leader, not a pamphlet.
%rangimarie_214%	Yeah, ideas matter, but in the end you just want someone you can trust at the helm.
%rangimarie_215%	The future is uncertain and not everything that will happen is detailed in a program.
%rangimarie_216%	That's why you need someone your gut tells is the right person.
%rangimarie_217%	Mmm... I see your point...
%rangimarie_218%	If I vouch for you, it speaks to your character, and people who trust me will feel like they can trust you, too.
%rangimarie_219%	Still, it feels like a gray area to me.
%rangimarie_220%	Ok...
%rangimarie_224%	Admiration clouds judgment.
%rangimarie_225%	You've seduced many minds through your art, so now you can feed them any idea and most of your followers will buy it.
%rangimarie_226%	Mmm...
%rangimarie_227%	I see your point, but shouldn't critical thinking be the responsibility of the individual?
%rangimarie_228%	Maybe, but you know that's not how it actually works.
%rangimarie_229%	Yeah, I get you...
%rangimarie_232%	Then the question is... Am I not allowed to express my views due to my celebrity status?
%rangimarie_235%	I believe you should remain politically neutral.
%rangimarie_236%	You're right, let's use your voice.
%rangimarie_237%	You must, but it shouldn't involve payment.
%rangimarie_241%	I believe you should remain politically neutral.
%rangimarie_243%	Oh, I completely disagree with you on this one.
%rangimarie_244%	It's precisely people in my position who should use their platform to make the universe a better place.
%rangimarie_245%	But it's unfair. Your political capital isn't due to your understanding of the state of affairs.
%rangimarie_246%	It's just... popularity... for doing cool stuff.
%rangimarie_247%	Your word shouldn't bear any more weight than any other Witch.
%rangimarie_248%	It's irresponsible. You probably aren't knowledgeable enough to be impacting cosmic politics.
%rangimarie_249%	Ah...
%rangimarie_250%	I see... You may have a point there.
%rangimarie_251%	Actually, I need to do some thinking.
%rangimarie_252%	I'll remain neutral in this race, give myself some time to decide how I feel about all of this.
%rangimarie_253%	Oh, I wasn't expecting to actually convince you, that's not how usually these things go, haha.
%rangimarie_255%	What can I say, you're a great politician!
%rangimarie_256%	Ugh... I don't really like the sound of that.
%rangimarie_258%	Thank you so much for the talk, and for putting in the effort to explain the implications of it all.
%rangimarie_259%	Yeah, it's been a very interesting talk for me, as well. Thanks to you too.
%rangimarie_260%	Good luck with the race!
%rangimarie_261%	Thank you for coming!
%rangimarie_266%	You're right, let's use your voice.
%rangimarie_268%	Really?
%rangimarie_269%	Yes! You convinced me!
%rangimarie_270%	Oh! That's great! I was starting to fear this wasn't going to end well, hah.
%rangimarie_271%	I mean, I just wanted to explore the implications. But I'm in now.
%rangimarie_272%	You made some very valid points.
%rangimarie_276%	You are allowed, and you should!
%rangimarie_277%	I don't think it's bad to use your influence to steer the cosmos towards what you think is right.
%rangimarie_279%	But...
%rangimarie_280%	But...
%rangimarie_281%	If we pay you, it'll cast doubt on whether you truly believe in us, or if your interests lie elsewhere.
%rangimarie_282%	If our cause is truly important to you, bet your own magic on it.
%rangimarie_283%	Mmm... ok.
%rangimarie_284%	I'm starting to see where you're coming from.
%rangimarie_285%	I'm sorry, but I can't morally allow myself to fund any kind of celebrity endorsement.
%rangimarie_286%	I understand. You made a really valid point, Fortuna.
%rangimarie_287%	In fact...
%rangimarie_289%	You convinced me!
%rangimarie_290%	Let's remove any magic exchange from this equation.
%rangimarie_291%	What do you say? Do you want to write a poem together?
%rangimarie_294%	I'd love to!
%rangimarie_295%	I don't know, maybe next time.
%rangimarie_296%	I'd rather not, I still feel weird about it.
%rangimarie_301%	I'd love to!
%rangimarie_302%	Galactic. I have a great feeling about this!
%rangimarie_304%	I'm glad you talked me into removing payment entirely.
%rangimarie_305%	So it was a payment after all...
%rangimarie_306%	No! You know what I mean.
%rangimarie_307%	Haha, yeah, yeah.
%rangimarie_308%	Now, about composing the poem.
%rangimarie_312%	I don't know, maybe next time.
%rangimarie_315%	I'd rather not, I still feel weird about it.
%rangimarie_318%	Oh...
%rangimarie_319%	Bummer.
%rangimarie_320%	For a moment I felt we were close to something truly great.
%rangimarie_321%	But I respect your decision, of course!
%rangimarie_322%	When one's not feeling it there's nothing to be done about it.
%rangimarie_323%	Thanks for your understanding.
%rangimarie_324%	I'll leave you to it, then.
%rangimarie_325%	But I do hope we can make something together in the future.
%rangimarie_326%	Of course, a pleasure to meet you, Rangimarie.
%rangimarie_327%	Take care.
%rangimarie_329%	You too!
%rangimarie_334%	Mmm... ok, you got me.
%rangimarie_335%	I just felt instinctively against it, but I guess everyone is using every tool at their disposal to get their message across.
%rangimarie_336%	That's it. No need to pull your punches here.
%rangimarie_337%	So what do you say, shall we make a poem together to boost your campaign?
%rangimarie_340%	Very well, I'm in. Here's your energy.
%rangimarie_341%	I don't know, maybe next time.
%rangimarie_342%	I'd rather not, I still feel weird about it.
%rangimarie_346%	Very well, I'm in. Here's your energy.
%rangimarie_350%	It just feels wrong, I don't want to do it.
%rangimarie_351%	Ah... ok. I won't push it.
%rangimarie_352%	I'm sorry if I upset you in any way.
%rangimarie_353%	We can try and make some poems for fun when this is all over, all right?
%rangimarie_354%	Ok, that sounds good!
%rangimarie_355%	Thanks for making some time for me, in any case.
%rangimarie_356%	I'm still rooting for you!
%rangimarie_357%	Thank you. Thank you.
%rangimarie_363%	Look, let's cut the crap, I just want it cheaper.
%rangimarie_364%	Wh-what...?
%rangimarie_365%	You're selling here, and I'm making a counter-offer.
%rangimarie_366%	That's not at all what's going on...
%rangimarie_367%	I genuinely wanted to support your cause.
%rangimarie_368%	That's perfect, but you can support us at a discount, right?
%rangimarie_369%	Uh...
%rangimarie_370%	Look. Forget it.
%rangimarie_371%	I'm not feeling it anymore.
%rangimarie_372%	So you were in this for the energy, after all.
%rangimarie_373%	I'm sorry we couldn't connect.
%rangimarie_374%	Next time, then.
%rangimarie_375%	Yeah, I don't know.
%rangimarie_376%	Thanks for coming.
%rangimarie_381%	I've heard wonders about your divination.
%rangimarie_382%	I wonder if we could use it for something avant-garde?
%rangimarie_383%	Oh? What do you have in mind?
%rangimarie_384%	Instead of actually writing the poem, let's peek into the future to see how it's going to end up.
%rangimarie_385%	And we can skip all the pain of actually pondering every single word.
%rangimarie_386%	Oh, a paradoxical cosmic poem. If we peek at how it'll look after going through all the process and iterations... we wouldn't need to actually put that work in!
%rangimarie_388%	Yes! Isn't it beautiful!?
%rangimarie_389%	My atoms shake at the mere thought!
%rangimarie_390%	I dig it, yeah.
%roll_call_dahlia_2%	Ready to take over the universe!?
%roll_call_dahlia_3%	Hahaha.
%roll_call_dahlia_4%	Commander Patrice, what's the situation?
%roll_call_dahlia_5%	Everything is set to go.
%roll_call_dahlia_7%	Election day has just been announced. We're merely $CYCLES cycles away from it.
%roll_call_dahlia_11%	First of all, thank you so much for your help, Grethe.
%roll_call_dahlia_12%	Sure. Happy to assist.
%roll_call_dahlia_13%	I'm sorry for the interrogation earlier, but never in her mortal or witch life have I known Fortuna to fall for anyone.
%roll_call_dahlia_14%	I needed to check what your deal was.
%roll_call_dahlia_15%	No problem. Did I pass?
%roll_call_dahlia_16%	You both seem equally self-absorbed, so I guess you won't clash much.
%roll_call_dahlia_17%	Hey, what does that mean?
%roll_call_dahlia_18%	Hehe, just teasing. Enjoy yourselves.
%roll_call_dahlia_19%	Grethe is the fucking best.
%roll_call_dahlia_20%	Can't believe the two of you are hitting it off!
%roll_call_dahlia_21%	Heh, you sure this wasn't your set up from the very beginning?
%roll_call_dahlia_22%	Haha, I'm not that cunning. I'm just happy that two of my favorite Witches got together.
%roll_call_dahlia_23%	I'm sure you'll make each other grow in formidable ways.
%roll_call_dahlia_24%	I'm sure planning on exploiting having a soothsaying girlfriend.
%roll_call_dahlia_25%	Ah... What did I get myself into...
%roll_call_dahlia_26%	I'm kidding, it's you who inspires me, not your cards.
%roll_call_dahlia_27%	Aw, Grethe...
%roll_call_dahlia_28%	Ahem, let's focus, team.
%roll_call_dahlia_29%	Oops, sure.
%roll_call_dahlia_31%	How are you feeling, Dahlia?
%roll_call_dahlia_32%	ABOUT TO EXPLODE!
%roll_call_dahlia_33%	I've got too much pent up energy.
%roll_call_dahlia_34%	Just set some objectives for me and I will obliterate them!
%roll_call_dahlia_35%	Metaphorically, I hope.
%roll_call_dahlia_36%	Metaphorically, mainly, yes. But I'm ready to take on a dozen Daemons if necessary, too.
%roll_call_dahlia_37%	Haha, good to know. Let's get to work then.
%roll_call_dahlia_38%	We're going to check the vibe of the coven, first.
%roll_call_dahlia_39%	Programs have already been made public, so Witches are starting to form their own ideas regarding this race.
%roll_call_dahlia_40%	We can tap into the mind of the coven with the Dreamball.
%roll_call_dahlia_41%	The Dreamball allows us to get real time readings on our community's desires and expectations.
%roll_call_dahlia_42%	Hence, we can filter the current vote intention.
%roll_call_dahlia_44%	Whoa, spreadsheet sorcery, that's some high level magic.
%roll_call_dahlia_45%	This will be the pivotal tool for adjusting our strategies as the race progresses.
%roll_call_dahlia_46%	Every action we perform, and the actions of our opponents, of course, will affect the coven's sympathies and that'll be reflected in the Dreamball's readings.
%roll_call_dahlia_47%	I added some Mens Runes to filter vote intention by demographic.
%roll_call_dahlia_48%	Go ahead and browse through them.
%roll_call_dahlia_49%	I encourage you to put some time into familiarizing yourself with the characteristics of each group.
%roll_call_dahlia_50%	Absolutely. I've been preparing myself for the race by doing some reading about the history of the coven and the different factions.
%roll_call_dahlia_51%	I'm not just muscle.
%roll_call_dahlia_52%	That's good.
%roll_call_dahlia_53%	Fortuna, as the oracle of the team you'd better take responsibility and do some studying, too.
%roll_call_dahlia_57%	Since I know you're not a people person I wrote a quick guide for you.
%roll_call_dahlia_59%	Luckily for you, your sister is one of the coven's archivists.
%roll_call_dahlia_60%	I already wrote down a comprehensive demographic analysis for you.
%roll_call_dahlia_63%	Luckily for you, as a detective I spent enough time dealing with each faction myself.
%roll_call_dahlia_64%	I'm lending you my field notes so you can familiarize yourself with the different communities of this coven.
%roll_call_dahlia_67%	Luckily for you, as the founder of the Cosmic Gazette I know a fair amount about the idiosyncrasies of our coven.
%roll_call_dahlia_68%	I wrote down a comprehensive demographic analysis for you.
%roll_call_dahlia_70%	I took the liberty of placing it all in your library, for when you have the time to go and do some studying.
%roll_call_dahlia_73%	Ugh... Do I really have to?
%roll_call_dahlia_74%	Whoa, thank you so much.
%roll_call_dahlia_78%	Ugh... Do I really have to?
%roll_call_dahlia_79%	If you just want to wing it, that's ok with me!
%roll_call_dahlia_80%	Your instincts are as powerful as information!
%roll_call_dahlia_81%	Come on... It's not that much.
%roll_call_dahlia_82%	But suit yourself.
%roll_call_dahlia_83%	Ok, ok...
%roll_call_dahlia_87%	Whoa, thank you so much.
%roll_call_dahlia_88%	I got you.
%roll_call_dahlia_90%	Now, about how we're going to operate.
%roll_call_dahlia_91%	Fortuna, you won't be able to accomplish much by yourself out there, being exiled and all.
%roll_call_dahlia_92%	So you are going to be in charge of team management from this point on.
%roll_call_dahlia_93%	Ah... shouldn't it be someone more prepared than me?
%roll_call_dahlia_94%	We're all gonna be busy heading out for events, gathering support or whatever is needed.
%roll_call_dahlia_95%	We need someone tracking all of our efforts and assigning tasks so we can better focus on our mission without worrying about schedules.
%roll_call_dahlia_96%	You are extremely intelligent and have sharp instincts, I have zero doubts that you will do an excellent job.
%roll_call_dahlia_97%	You've got this, Forty!
%roll_call_dahlia_98%	F--
%roll_call_dahlia_99%	I mean, Fortuna!
%roll_call_dahlia_100%	Ok, sure. I'm ready. Whatever it takes.
%roll_call_dahlia_101%	You just keep track of the vote intention and try to redirect our efforts towards increasing our vote count, as in...
%roll_call_dahlia_102%	Promoting some point of the program, looking for allies, gathering intel, or even harvesting energy for your deck should it become necessary for any reason...
%roll_call_dahlia_103%	Bear in mind that these tasks will take between 3 and 5 cycles each, so plan accordingly.
%roll_call_dahlia_104%	Understood.
%roll_call_dahlia_105%	But wait, what do I do while you're all out?
%roll_call_dahlia_106%	Mmm...
%roll_call_dahlia_107%	Do your homework.
%roll_call_dahlia_108%	Do some studying, make some cards. Or jerk off to relieve the pressure.
%roll_call_dahlia_109%	Patrice!
%roll_call_dahlia_110%	What? It works, trust me.
%roll_call_dahlia_111%	Hahaha.
%roll_call_dahlia_112%	Always so gross.
%roll_call_dahlia_113%	As the race progresses, you'll have to meet some prospective allies or even rivals here in this office.
%roll_call_dahlia_114%	So don't worry, I don't think you'll get much idle time.
%roll_call_dahlia_115%	Ok...
%roll_call_dahlia_116%	Everyone ready? Any doubts?
%roll_call_dahlia_120%	No, ma'am. I'm ready to support you all til the finish line.
%roll_call_dahlia_121%	Good.
%roll_call_dahlia_123%	Let's get out there already!
%roll_call_dahlia_124%	Oh! I almost forgot.
%roll_call_dahlia_125%	I've got something for you, Fortuna.
%roll_call_fortuna_2%	Everything is set to go.
%roll_call_fortuna_4%	Election day has just been announced. We're merely $CYCLES cycles away from it.
%roll_call_fortuna_5%	We have everything we need, so let's get to work.
%roll_call_fortuna_9%	It's only the two of us, so we'll have to decide carefully where we focus our efforts.
%roll_call_fortuna_10%	...Don't you have any friends?
%roll_call_fortuna_11%	Yes. They're both running against me.
%roll_call_fortuna_12%	And that's it? Centuries of Witch existence amount to only those two friends?
%roll_call_fortuna_13%	Can we focus on the here and now, please?
%roll_call_fortuna_14%	Yeah, we'd better.
%roll_call_fortuna_17%	First of all, thank you so much for your help, Grethe.
%roll_call_fortuna_18%	Sure. Happy to assist.
%roll_call_fortuna_19%	I'm sorry for the interrogation earlier, but never in her mortal or Witch life have I known Fortuna to fall for anyone.
%roll_call_fortuna_20%	I needed to check what your deal was.
%roll_call_fortuna_21%	No problem. Did I pass?
%roll_call_fortuna_22%	You both seem equally self-absorbed, so I guess you won't clash much.
%roll_call_fortuna_23%	Hey, what does that mean?
%roll_call_fortuna_24%	Hehe, just teasing. Enjoy yourselves.
%roll_call_fortuna_25%	Now..
%roll_call_fortuna_29%	The most critical point is:
%roll_call_fortuna_30%	What do we do with this massive Behemoth?
%roll_call_fortuna_31%	Yeah, that. What do we do with your sister's savior?
%roll_call_fortuna_32%	What could we possibly do with the help of an almighty being, older than time, who's able to grant wishes?
%roll_call_fortuna_33%	Can you make everyone vote for us?
%roll_call_fortuna_34%	Yes.
%roll_call_fortuna_35%	What are you willing to pay in exchange?
%roll_call_fortuna_39%	Can't you grant wishes without a price?
%roll_call_fortuna_40%	Aren't you and Fortuna friends at this point?
%roll_call_fortuna_41%	Yeah, I love Fortuna, but the Cosmic Wheel needs its offering in order for my magic to work.
%roll_call_fortuna_44%	Hah, no need for that. Fortuna is a wish granter herself at this point. She already wrote that we'll win the elections.
%roll_call_fortuna_45%	Why bother doing anything, then?
%roll_call_fortuna_46%	I am... compelled by some cosmic force?
%roll_call_fortuna_47%	Oh, I see.
%roll_call_fortuna_48%	We are sentient puppets at this point, aren't we, Fortuna?
%roll_call_fortuna_51%	I'm sorry...
%roll_call_fortuna_52%	Yup. I'll make you do all sorts of funny things.
%roll_call_fortuna_53%	Would you like me to write you some free will?
%roll_call_fortuna_57%	I'm sorry...
%roll_call_fortuna_58%	Ah, come on. I was just teasing you.
%roll_call_fortuna_59%	Don't beat yourself up. Try to enjoy your mightiness.
%roll_call_fortuna_63%	Yup. I'll make you do all sorts of funny things.
%roll_call_fortuna_64%	Hah, you just try.
%roll_call_fortuna_65%	Ok, let's draw a card.
%roll_call_fortuna_66%	Wait, wait! No...
%roll_call_fortuna_67%	I was just kidding.
%roll_call_fortuna_68%	Hahaha.
%roll_call_fortuna_72%	Would you like me to write you some free will?
%roll_call_fortuna_73%	Mmm... we haven't explored how well the deck fares against paradoxes.
%roll_call_fortuna_74%	That's an interesting line of investigation.
%roll_call_fortuna_78%	Ahem.
%roll_call_fortuna_79%	Let's focus on the task at hand, please.
%roll_call_fortuna_80%	Oops. Sure.
%roll_call_fortuna_82%	What can a Behemoth do for free?
%roll_call_fortuna_83%	Mmm... I could disguise myself as a familiar and deliver messages.
%roll_call_fortuna_84%	I can harvest energy.
%roll_call_fortuna_85%	I can... spread rumors...
%roll_call_fortuna_86%	Interesting...
%roll_call_fortuna_87%	And I think that's about it, if we don't want to draw too much attention to my powers.
%roll_call_fortuna_88%	It's already more than I expected, so great.
%roll_call_fortuna_89%	Happy to surpass your expectations, oh dominant sister.
%roll_call_fortuna_90%	Which grimoire of clowns did you find this one in, Fortuna?
%roll_call_fortuna_91%	Hahahaha.
%roll_call_fortuna_94%	Let's check the vibe of the coven, first.
%roll_call_fortuna_95%	Programs have already been made public, so Witches are starting to form their own ideas regarding this race.

%roll_call_fortuna_102%	I added some Mens Runes to filter vote intention by demographic.
%roll_call_fortuna_103%	Go ahead and browse through them.
%roll_call_fortuna_104%	I encourage you to put some time into familiarizing yourself with the characteristics of each group.
%roll_call_fortuna_105%	You not only need their votes, but you also plan on becoming their leader, so you'd better take responsibility and do some studying.
%roll_call_fortuna_109%	Since I know you're not a people person I wrote a quick guide for you.
%roll_call_fortuna_111%	Luckily for you, your sister is one of the coven's archivists.

%roll_call_fortuna_120%	I wrote down a comprehensive demographic analysis for you.
%roll_call_fortuna_122%	I took the liberty of placing it all in your library, for when you have the time to go and do some studying.
%roll_call_fortuna_125%	Ugh... Do I really have to?
%roll_call_fortuna_126%	Whoa, thank you so much.
%roll_call_fortuna_130%	Ugh... Do I really have to?
%roll_call_fortuna_131%	Come on... It's not that much.
%roll_call_fortuna_132%	But suit yourself. You can just try and wing it, if you prefer.
%roll_call_fortuna_133%	Ok, ok...
%roll_call_fortuna_137%	Whoa, thank you so much.
%roll_call_fortuna_138%	I got you.
%roll_call_fortuna_140%	Now, about how we are going to operate.
%roll_call_fortuna_141%	Fortuna, you won't be able to accomplish much by yourself out there, being exiled and all.
%roll_call_fortuna_143%	But we will act as your will outside this room.
%roll_call_fortuna_144%	Just let us know what you want us to do and we'll set out to do so.
%roll_call_fortuna_147%	But I will act as your will outside this room.
%roll_call_fortuna_148%	Just let me know what you want me to do and I'll set out to do so.
%roll_call_fortuna_150%	It could be promoting some point of the program, looking for allies, gathering intel, harvesting some energy for your deck...
%roll_call_fortuna_151%	Bear in mind that these tasks will take between 3 and 5 cycles each, so plan accordingly.
%roll_call_fortuna_152%	Understood.
%roll_call_fortuna_153%	But wait, what do I do while you're all out?
%roll_call_fortuna_154%	Mmm...
%roll_call_fortuna_155%	Do your homework.
%roll_call_fortuna_156%	Do some studying, make some cards. Or jerk off to relieve the pressure.
%roll_call_fortuna_157%	Patrice!
%roll_call_fortuna_158%	What? It works, trust me.
%roll_call_fortuna_159%	Always so gross.
%roll_call_fortuna_160%	As the race progresses, you'll have to meet some prospective allies or even rivals here in this office.
%roll_call_fortuna_161%	So don't worry, I don't think you'll get much idle time.
%roll_call_fortuna_162%	Ok...
%roll_call_fortuna_164%	Everyone ready? Any doubts?
%roll_call_fortuna_168%	No, ma'am. I'm ready to support Fortuna til the finish line.
%roll_call_fortuna_169%	Good.
%roll_call_fortuna_173%	Let's conquer all.
%roll_call_fortuna_174%	Well, rather than conquer... let's have our sisters put their trust in us.
%roll_call_fortuna_175%	Yes, of course. It was a figure of speech.
%roll_call_fortuna_176%	Ok. We can never be too safe with you.
%roll_call_fortuna_177%	Hahah...
%roll_call_fortuna_179%	Oh! I almost forgot.
%roll_call_fortuna_180%	I've got something for you, Fortuna.
%roll_call_jasmine_2%	Everything is set to go.
%roll_call_jasmine_4%	Election day has just been announced. We're merely $CYCLES cycles away from it.
%roll_call_jasmine_5%	Can't believe it's finally happening.
%roll_call_jasmine_9%	First of all, thank you so much for your help, Grethe.
%roll_call_jasmine_10%	Sure. Happy to assist.
%roll_call_jasmine_11%	I'm sorry for the interrogation earlier, but never in her mortal or Witch life have I known Fortuna to fall for anyone.
%roll_call_jasmine_12%	I needed to check what your deal was.
%roll_call_jasmine_13%	No problem. Did I pass?
%roll_call_jasmine_14%	You both seem equally self-absorbed, so I guess you won't clash much.
%roll_call_jasmine_15%	Hey, what does that mean?
%roll_call_jasmine_16%	Hehe, just teasing. Enjoy yourselves.
%roll_call_jasmine_17%	I've only just met her and I can already tell what Dahlia and Fortuna see in her.
%roll_call_jasmine_18%	I'm super excited to work together, Grethe!
%roll_call_jasmine_19%	Ah, likewise.
%roll_call_jasmine_21%	How are you feeling, Jasmine?
%roll_call_jasmine_22%	Well...
%roll_call_jasmine_23%	Extremely nervous, but also ready for anything.
%roll_call_jasmine_24%	My determination is stronger than ever. I've never tried to achieve something this ambitious, all my senses are amped up.
%roll_call_jasmine_25%	Try to enjoy it. You have the best team in this race.
%roll_call_jasmine_26%	I know! I'm so happy and proud!
%roll_call_jasmine_27%	Haha, good. Let's get to work.
%roll_call_jasmine_28%	We're going to check the vibe of the coven, first.
%roll_call_jasmine_29%	Programs have already been made public, so Witches are starting to form their own ideas regarding this race.
%roll_call_jasmine_30%	We can tap into the mind of the coven with the Dreamball.
%roll_call_jasmine_31%	The Dreamball allows us to get real time readings on our community's desires and expectations.
%roll_call_jasmine_32%	Hence, we can filter the current vote intention.
%roll_call_jasmine_34%	Wow, so professional!
%roll_call_jasmine_35%	This will be the pivotal tool for adjusting our strategies as the race progresses.
%roll_call_jasmine_36%	Every action we perform, and the actions of our opponents, of course, will affect the coven's sympathies and that'll be reflected in the Dreamball's readings.
%roll_call_jasmine_37%	I added some Mens Runes to filter vote intention by demographic.
%roll_call_jasmine_38%	Go ahead and browse through them.
%roll_call_jasmine_39%	I encourage you to put some time into familiarizing yourself with the characteristics of each group.
%roll_call_jasmine_40%	Absolutely. I already did my homework, but I'll spend any free time delving into the intricacies of each group.
%roll_call_jasmine_41%	Fortuna, as the oracle of the team you'd better take responsibility and do some studying.
%roll_call_jasmine_45%	Since I know you're not a people person, I wrote a quick guide for you.
%roll_call_jasmine_47%	Luckily for you, your sister is one of the coven's archivists.
%roll_call_jasmine_48%	I already wrote down a comprehensive demographic analysis for you.
%roll_call_jasmine_51%	Luckily for you, as a detective I spent enough time dealing with each faction myself.
%roll_call_jasmine_52%	I'm lending you my field notes so you can familiarize yourself with the different communities of this coven.
%roll_call_jasmine_55%	Luckily for you, as the founder of the Cosmic Gazette I know a fair amount about the idiosyncrasies of our coven.
%roll_call_jasmine_56%	I wrote down a comprehensive demographic analysis for you.
%roll_call_jasmine_58%	I took the liberty of placing it all in your library, for when you have the time to go and do some studying.
%roll_call_jasmine_61%	Ugh... Do I really have to?
%roll_call_jasmine_62%	Whoa, thank you so much.
%roll_call_jasmine_66%	Ugh... Do I really have to?
%roll_call_jasmine_67%	Come on... It's not that much.
%roll_call_jasmine_68%	But suit yourself.
%roll_call_jasmine_69%	Come on, Fortuna, please, do it for me!
%roll_call_jasmine_70%	It's never a bad idea to get to know your sisters better!
%roll_call_jasmine_71%	Ok, ok...
%roll_call_jasmine_75%	Whoa, thank you so much.
%roll_call_jasmine_76%	I got you.
%roll_call_jasmine_78%	Now, about how we're going to operate.
%roll_call_jasmine_79%	Fortuna, you won't be able to accomplish much by yourself out there, being exiled and all.
%roll_call_jasmine_80%	So you're going to be in charge of team management from this point onwards.
%roll_call_jasmine_81%	Ah... shouldn't it be someone more prepared than me?
%roll_call_jasmine_82%	We're all gonna be busy heading out for events, gathering support or whatever is needed.
%roll_call_jasmine_83%	We need someone tracking all of our efforts and assigning tasks so we can better focus on our mission without worrying about schedules.
%roll_call_jasmine_84%	You are extremely intelligent and have sharp instincts, I have zero doubts that you will do an excellent job.
%roll_call_jasmine_85%	Yes, I feel extra confident with you having my back, Fortuna!
%roll_call_jasmine_86%	I wouldn't want it any other way.
%roll_call_jasmine_87%	Alright, I'll give it my all.
%roll_call_jasmine_88%	You just keep track of the vote intention and try to redirect our efforts towards increasing our vote count, as in...
%roll_call_jasmine_89%	Promoting some point of the program, looking for allies, gathering intel, or even harvesting energy for your deck should it become necessary for any reason...
%roll_call_jasmine_90%	Bear in mind that these tasks will take between 3 and 5 cycles each, so plan accordingly.
%roll_call_jasmine_91%	Understood.
%roll_call_jasmine_92%	But wait, what do I do while you're all out?
%roll_call_jasmine_93%	Mmm...
%roll_call_jasmine_94%	Do your homework.
%roll_call_jasmine_95%	Do some studying, make some cards. Or jerk off to relieve the pressure.
%roll_call_jasmine_96%	Patrice!
%roll_call_jasmine_97%	What? It works, trust me.
%roll_call_jasmine_98%	Always so gross.
%roll_call_jasmine_99%	As the race progresses, you'll have to meet some prospective allies or even rivals here in this office.
%roll_call_jasmine_100%	So don't worry, I don't think you'll get much idle time.
%roll_call_jasmine_101%	Ok...
%roll_call_jasmine_102%	Everyone ready? Any doubts?
%roll_call_jasmine_106%	No, ma'am. I'm ready to support you all til the finish line.
%roll_call_jasmine_107%	Good.
%roll_call_jasmine_109%	Ready!!
%roll_call_jasmine_110%	As ready as I'll ever be.
%roll_call_jasmine_111%	Oh! I almost forgot.
%roll_call_jasmine_112%	I've got something for you, Fortuna.
%wunn_decision_11%	Hello, oracle.
%wunn_decision_12%	Do you have an answer?
%wunn_decision_13%	Yes. I'm ready.
%wunn_decision_14%	Very well.
%wunn_decision_15%	Who do you want me to sabotage?
%wunn_decision_18%	Dahlia.
%wunn_decision_19%	Jasmine.
%wunn_decision_20%	Cupressa.
%wunn_decision_21%	No one.
%wunn_decision_26%	Dahlia.
%wunn_decision_30%	Jasmine.
%wunn_decision_34%	Cupressa.
%wunn_decision_36%	Perfect. I will start stirring decay into her party.
%wunn_decision_37%	It'll be almost impossible for them to win.
%wunn_decision_38%	Yeah?
%wunn_decision_39%	Nothing else? No moral of the story or anything?
%wunn_decision_40%	You chose wisely.
%wunn_decision_41%	If you forwent the opportunity to get ahead of your rivals, I would have known then that you were not fit to lead us.
%wunn_decision_42%	Wow. Harsh.
%wunn_decision_43%	So no need to feel guilty or anything, then.
%wunn_decision_44%	That is entirely up to you.
%wunn_decision_45%	Ok... Cool.
%wunn_decision_46%	I'm looking forward to serving under you, Oracle.
%wunn_decision_47%	I'm honored.
%wunn_decision_48%	Thank you for your support.
%wunn_decision_49%	I'll leave now to execute my mission.
%wunn_decision_55%	No one.
%wunn_decision_56%	I understand.
%wunn_decision_57%	And how do you feel about passing on the opportunity to ensure your victory?
%wunn_decision_60%	Proud.
%wunn_decision_61%	Frustrated.
%wunn_decision_62%	Relaxed.
%wunn_decision_63%	Scared.
%wunn_decision_67%	Proud.
%wunn_decision_71%	Frustrated.
%wunn_decision_75%	Relaxed.
%wunn_decision_79%	Scared.
%wunn_decision_81%	I totally understand, since what you did was unwise.
%wunn_decision_82%	Come again?
%wunn_decision_85%	That's a shame.
%wunn_decision_87%	I don't believe that you are fit to become the leader of our coven.
%wunn_decision_88%	What!? Why? Didn't you say this was a test?
%wunn_decision_89%	Didn't I just take the high road and act honorably?
%wunn_decision_90%	Exactly.
%wunn_decision_91%	You forwent the opportunity to get ahead of your rivals. You are unfit to rule.
%wunn_decision_92%	That's not fair.
%wunn_decision_93%	The cosmos is as fair as a black hole.
%wunn_decision_94%	You can only hope now that your sisters are as naive as you are.
%wunn_decision_95%	And I sincerely hope not, or I'll be forced to leave this obviously decaying coven.
%wunn_decision_96%	A sisterhood with the values you uphold is no sisterhood at all.
%wunn_decision_97%	Being unable to perceive entropy is what makes you an idealist, a widespread disease among human Witches.
%wunn_decision_98%	But ideals are for those who are well fed and taken care of.
%wunn_decision_99%	The wheel should always be steered by someone who's able to perceive the cosmos for what it is.
%wunn_decision_100%	Time to disprove you, I guess.
%wunn_decision_101%	Good luck with that.
%wunn_decision_102%	...
%wunn_3%	Welcome!
%wunn_5%	Hello, oracle.
%wunn_6%	This isn't a social visit, so I will cut to the chase.
%wunn_7%	I want to use your energy to sabotage your rivals' efforts.
%wunn_9%	Eh...
%wunn_11%	No need to answer immediately. This is also a test, in fact. I won't hide that.
%wunn_13%	Wait! I don't understand you!
%wunn_15%	Oh...
%wunn_16%	If you don't speak the Tongue of the Nebula, there's not much we can do together.
%wunn_17%	I'm sorry, I will take my leave.
%wunn_19%	Mmm... maybe there is a way for us to connect.
%wunn_22%	(Consult with the cards.)
%wunn_23%	(Use Aedana's power to read into Wunn.)
%wunn_24%	(Use Aedana's knowledge to translate.)
%wunn_25%	(I shouldn't abuse my powers, I'll let this go.)
%wunn_29%	Bear with me a second.
%wunn_30%	I can't understand what you're saying, but I have the feeling that you do understand me, right?
%wunn_32%	Yes.
%wunn_34%	I hope that's a yes.
%wunn_35%	Anyway, if you're ok with it, I can use my cards to explore what shape a collaboration between us could take.
%wunn_37%	I see... I will give you a chance, yes.
%wunn_39%	Is that a yes? Doesn't sound like a yes.
%wunn_41%	Yes.
%wunn_42%	Do it.
%wunn_43%	...
%wunn_45%	yyyyess.
%wunn_46%	Ok!!
%wunn_47%	Here we go.
%wunn_53%	Oh, please, golden sea shells, capture the words of my sister and whisper their meaning to me.
%wunn_54%	Grant us a chance at connection.
%wunn_59%	Nemesis and mentor, this, your eye, once studied every tongue.
%wunn_60%	Grant me access to my sister's words.
%wunn_62%	...
%wunn_63%	Well, did it work?
%wunn_64%	Yes!
%wunn_65%	I can understand you perfectly fine now!
%wunn_66%	It worries me that you don't know the Tongue of the Nebula. It is the only way to access true knowledge and power.
%wunn_67%	Ah... yes, it's extremely hard for human Witches to master, but it's a skill I want to acquire eventually.
%wunn_69%	Very well.
%wunn_70%	Where was I... Oh, yes.
%wunn_71%	I have the power to destroy your party.
%wunn_72%	Alright, here we go.
%wunn_73%	I don't know if you are familiar with my arts. I have the ability to sabotage anything.
%wunn_74%	There's a path to decay in everything, be it a planet, a community or an idea.
%wunn_75%	I can read those lines and steer anything in that direction.
%wunn_76%	And what's the purpose of coming to say all of this to my face?
%wunn_77%	A test.
%wunn_79%	I do believe that having an oracle among the leadership is essential for the future of our coven.
%wunn_80%	That's why yours is my favorite party.
%wunn_83%	The best prospect for our coven is to have a powerful oracle at the helm.
%wunn_84%	That's why you are my favorite candidate.
%wunn_86%	Good to know! You have a funny way of showing support, though.
%wunn_87%	I need to ascertain that you have what it takes to lead.
%wunn_88%	...What do you propose?
%wunn_89%	I am going to offer you the opportunity to sabotage your rivals' efforts.
%wunn_90%	I have already studied them and know how to suffocate their momentum.
%wunn_91%	Just say the word and they are done.
%wunn_92%	Mmm...
%wunn_93%	But, should you reject my offer, I will go to your rivals and offer this very same deal to them.
%wunn_94%	Oh, nice. Ok.
%wunn_95%	Don't answer me yet.
%wunn_96%	This is a test, after all, so I want you to take your time and ponder how you will act in this scenario.
%wunn_97%	So, let's see if I've understood you.
%wunn_98%	You are threatening to destroy us if we don't choose to destroy our opponents.
%wunn_99%	I believe it's a bit more nuanced than that.
%wunn_100%	Your rivals may reject the offer too. Do you trust your sisters to play as fair as you will?
%wunn_101%	I see...
%wunn_102%	So do you get off on this kind of stuff, or what's the deal with you?
%wunn_103%	...
%wunn_104%	Give it some thought.
%wunn_105%	I am not bluffing.
%wunn_106%	I need to try transforming our coven to assess if it can stand the test of entropy.
%wunn_107%	Mmm... ok.
%wunn_108%	Take your time.
%wunn_109%	Summon me when you are ready to make a choice.
%wunn_110%	Do not choose, and I will make the choice for you.
%wunn_116%	I'm so sorry but I'm afraid this isn't going to work.
%wunn_118%	Such a pity, I had high hopes for you.
%wunn_120%	Of course.
%wunn_121%	Maybe we can try again in the future when we find a communication spell that can help us?
%wunn_123%	The Tongue of the Nebula can't be translated via spells. You can only learn it.
%wunn_124%	It doesn't matter.
%wunn_125%	Goodbye.
%wunn_127%	Thanks for coming!
%yuenia_end_2%	Whoa, this is going to come in handy, alright.
%yuenia_end_3%	Plus... it's very nice to have a card that represents the place I grew as a Witch...
%yuenia_end_5%	Aw... Fortuna.
%yuenia_end_6%	Thank you, Yu-ënia.
%yuenia_end_8%	Ok, tea time is over.
%yuenia_end_9%	Now you focus on the campaign.
%yuenia_end_10%	Change the world, my child.
%yuenia_end_11%	Yes...
%yuenia_end_12%	Come back soon.
%yuenia_2%	Hello, Fortuna.
%yuenia_3%	I'm so happy to see you.
%yuenia_6%	Look at you! You've grown a lot. I sense Earth energy flowing out from you.
%yuenia_7%	I was worried exile would have consumed you...
%yuenia_8%	But you not only overcame this unfair punishment, you came out of it full of power.
%yuenia_11%	And that look in your eyes...
%yuenia_12%	Exile has been tough, right?
%yuenia_13%	There's so much Fire energy in you now. You've grown stronger. Intimidating even.
%yuenia_16%	Oh... Are you alright?
%yuenia_17%	Your Fire energy is weaker than it used to be.
%yuenia_18%	Two centuries of isolation is too much for anybody. But everything will be better from now on, we‘ll all help you, alright?
%yuenia_20%	I'm happy to see you too, master.
%yuenia_24%	...
%yuenia_27%	(Use Aedana's eye to read into her energies.)
%yuenia_28%	(Better to stay humble and not provoke her.)
%yuenia_32%	On the other hand, I see you are overflowing with Water energy, master.
%yuenia_33%	If I didn't know you better, I'd even say you've fallen in love?
%yuenia_35%	Oh...
%yuenia_36%	How incisive! Since when did you become so apt at energy-reading?
%yuenia_37%	Wait, so you really are in love?
%yuenia_39%	That's right.
%yuenia_40%	How's that possible? With who?
%yuenia_41%	Well, it's not a single soulmate we're talking about here.
%yuenia_42%	Since I opened my heart to love, I've had many lovers... some temporary, some everlasting, but I keep meeting interesting people and letting my Water energies flow.
%yuenia_43%	Wow, so there's nothing immutable in this cosmos, eh.
%yuenia_44%	I see you still remember your lessons well, haha.
%yuenia_46%	Ah, so...
%yuenia_47%	I guess that after all these years... I must have two centuries' worth of pent up lecture coming my way, right?
%yuenia_49%	Come again? Why would you?
%yuenia_50%	It's terrible enough that you had to spend all this time in exile.
%yuenia_52%	I should be the one listening to you today.
%yuenia_53%	I'm eager to hear the insights of an oracle who survived two hundred years of isolation.
%yuenia_54%	Oh...
%yuenia_55%	I wasn't ready for this.
%yuenia_56%	I totally thought you'd be ashamed or angry.
%yuenia_57%	In the beginning, maybe.
%yuenia_58%	But I'm not the same Witch you knew hundreds of years ago... I guess none of those you knew actually exist anymore as you remembered them.
%yuenia_59%	That's... a sad thought. But, yeah, I feel a bit alien even among my closest friends.
%yuenia_61%	Losing you has changed us all.
%yuenia_62%	Being cut off from my dear pupil so abruptly... It made me question my identity and my purpose.
%yuenia_63%	Master...
%yuenia_65%	Today I'm here to listen to you. Tell me about exile.
%yuenia_68%	I don't really have much to tell you about exile.
%yuenia_69%	I don't think I'll ever fully heal from this...
%yuenia_70%	It made me stronger. I'm way more powerful now.
%yuenia_74%	I don't really have much to tell you about exile.
%yuenia_75%	It's been... absolute nothingness.
%yuenia_76%	Alone with my thoughts, only able to escape through fiction.
%yuenia_77%	So uneventful that I don't even have a tale to tell you about it.
%yuenia_78%	I see...
%yuenia_79%	I guess it's still too traumatic to reflect on it.
%yuenia_80%	Plus you aren't free yet, technically.
%yuenia_82%	I'll try again in the future. I believe it's important for you to talk this out, and I'm going to be here for you. Not as a mentor anymore, but as your friend.
%yuenia_84%	Thank you...
%yuenia_88%	I don't think I'll ever fully heal from this...
%yuenia_89%	It's... it's been too much, master. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to live through.
%yuenia_90%	No one to talk to, eventually I started to hallucinate...
%yuenia_91%	I tried to escape my mind through fiction, substances, even pain. But no matter the stimulus, when in isolation, you grow numb to it all.
%yuenia_92%	Memory becomes a mirage. Not a single landmark in time to allow you to differentiate one day from another.
%yuenia_93%	It's been endless, and at the same time, I can barely remember it.
%yuenia_94%	The only thing remaining is this damage that I need to figure out how to outlive.
%yuenia_96%	Oh, Fortuna...
%yuenia_97%	I am so sorry.
%yuenia_98%	Thank you for sharing this with me.
%yuenia_99%	I am here for you, and I am going to help you find your peace, ok?
%yuenia_101%	Thank you...
%yuenia_105%	It made me stronger. I'm way more powerful now.
%yuenia_106%	It hasn't been easy, but I made it, and now it's just a blur in my memory.
%yuenia_107%	This trial pushed me to my limits and I managed to grow past them.
%yuenia_108%	Now I feel ready to take on anything.
%yuenia_109%	...
%yuenia_110%	I'm serious.
%yuenia_111%	I'm not going to say I'm thankful to Aedana, I still hate her with all my guts.
%yuenia_112%	But I would never have reached this level if I didn't have to push through this nightmare.
%yuenia_114%	But, Fortuna... power is not the measure of life.
%yuenia_115%	Becoming more powerful is not necessarily a synonym of progress.
%yuenia_116%	An existence which is not enjoyed is not much of an existence at all.
%yuenia_117%	I...
%yuenia_118%	I know... But I didn't have a say in this.
%yuenia_119%	So I'd better believe it's all been for something.
%yuenia_121%	Ah... yeah, I understand.
%yuenia_125%	And what about the Behemoth you summoned?
%yuenia_128%	Wh-a...?
%yuenia_129%	How do you...!?
%yuenia_130%	Aaa!
%yuenia_134%	Fortuna.
%yuenia_135%	It was me who taught you the forbidden song, of course I was going to notice.
%yuenia_138%	I'm so sorry... I was desperate.
%yuenia_139%	You know what? I don't regret using it.
%yuenia_140%	Why did you teach it to me to begin with!?
%yuenia_144%	I'm so sorry... I was desperate.
%yuenia_145%	I know. Don't worry.
%yuenia_147%	You did nothing wrong.
%yuenia_151%	You know what? I don't regret using it.
%yuenia_152%	Of course. I'm happy you did.
%yuenia_156%	Why did you teach it to me to begin with!?
%yuenia_157%	Calm down.
%yuenia_162%	I taught you that spell for a reason.
%yuenia_163%	It would be twisted to teach you something that you weren't meant to use.
%yuenia_164%	You knew that I'd eventually summon a Behemoth...?
%yuenia_166%	I wanted you to have the option.
%yuenia_167%	The option to break the Magical Pact!?
%yuenia_168%	Yes.
%yuenia_169%	You see, laws are just an agreement between members of a community, to have some broad guidelines about what is correct and what not.
%yuenia_170%	But hardly any law survives every context.
%yuenia_171%	Plus, to be frank, most of us are shoved into a system of rules we haven't previously agreed upon.
%yuenia_172%	I hear you...
%yuenia_173%	In this case, it saved my life.
%yuenia_174%	I knew that this day would come. That the moment you used the forbidden song you would become a fully fledged Witch.
%yuenia_176%	You are no longer my apprentice, and I'm no longer your master.
%yuenia_179%	Ah... that makes me feel kind of sad.
%yuenia_180%	I can finally stop feeling like a child.
%yuenia_184%	Ah... that makes me feel kind of sad.
%yuenia_186%	Hah, me too.
%yuenia_187%	But now we can relax and become something better than mentor and mentee.
%yuenia_188%	Now we can be friends, and I can rely on you. We can rely on each other.
%yuenia_189%	It's gonna be weird to treat you like I treat my friends, haha.
%yuenia_190%	I'm starting to regret this.
%yuenia_191%	Hahaha.
%yuenia_195%	I can finally stop feeling like a child.
%yuenia_196%	It's only taken me a human life and several centuries as a Witch.
%yuenia_198%	Hah, you tell me what it's like.
%yuenia_199%	I'm over a millennium old now, and I've never stopped feeling like a fawn.
%yuenia_200%	What? You feel like a kid? Master of the elements Yu-ënia?
%yuenia_201%	The imprint of childhood seems to be inescapable.
%yuenia_202%	Especially for us Witches, for whom death is not a certainty, the only ineludible truth we have is that we've been born.
%yuenia_203%	Well... shit.
%yuenia_208%	Fortuna, I am proud of you.
%yuenia_209%	...
%yuenia_210%	You're gonna make me cry.
%yuenia_212%	Haha, who would have thought that praise is what would finally break through your armor.
%yuenia_213%	Whatever... It's been a difficult couple of centuries...
%yuenia_214%	I know, my friend, I know.
%yuenia_215%	By the way, speaking of surprises...
%yuenia_216%	What's this about you getting into politics?
%yuenia_219%	Patrice forced me to, basically.
%yuenia_220%	I want to fix Aedana's damage.
%yuenia_221%	I want to help create a better universe.
%yuenia_222%	I don't really know.
%yuenia_226%	Patrice forced me to, basically.
%yuenia_227%	Ah, your other mentor.
%yuenia_228%	I don't officially recognize her as such.
%yuenia_229%	Haha, I know.
%yuenia_230%	But if she's put you up to this, I'm sure it's going to be something good for you.
%yuenia_231%	It's breaking me out of the stupor of being exiled, that's for sure.
%yuenia_232%	I see. That's good.
%yuenia_236%	I want to fix Aedana's damage.
%yuenia_237%	What damage?
%yuenia_240%	To myself.
%yuenia_241%	To the coven.
%yuenia_242%	To the universe.
%yuenia_243%	I don't know, I fucking hate her.
%yuenia_247%	To myself.
%yuenia_250%	To the coven.
%yuenia_253%	To the universe.
%yuenia_256%	I don't know, I fucking hate her.
%yuenia_260%	I don't know.
%yuenia_262%	I want to rob her of something. She deprived me of so much... it'll never be enough.
%yuenia_263%	I'm not sure if that's going to get you any closure.
%yuenia_264%	But I guess it's good that you might get some hatred out of your system.
%yuenia_268%	I want to help create a better universe.
%yuenia_269%	Oh, that's so unlike you.
%yuenia_270%	Hey, what does that mean?
%yuenia_271%	Ah, sorry. I mean, this is good, I think.
%yuenia_272%	You've always been so self-centered... I never expected that two hundred years alone with yourself would change that.
%yuenia_273%	I guess I finally got sick of myself.
%yuenia_274%	Haha, I'm sure it'll pass.
%yuenia_278%	I don't really know.
%yuenia_279%	I'm not even fully out of exile and I've been swept up by the circumstances.
%yuenia_280%	Yeah, Air energy is strong in the coven these days.
%yuenia_281%	Everyone is becoming more aware of each other, it's a constant tug-of-war in so many different directions.
%yuenia_282%	I guess I just want to restore some kind of peace so that I can enjoy my potential freedom.
%yuenia_283%	I understand.
%yuenia_287%	Can I help in any way?
%yuenia_290%	Can you vouch for us amongst the academics?
%yuenia_291%	Would you try to inspire the novices for us?
%yuenia_292%	Don't worry, we've got this.
%yuenia_297%	Can you vouch for us amongst the academics?
%yuenia_298%	Gladly.
%yuenia_303%	Would you try to inspire the novices for us?
%yuenia_304%	Absolutely, it'll be my pleasure.
%yuenia_308%	Don't worry, we've got this.
%yuenia_309%	Oh, very well.
%yuenia_310%	You don't want your old mentor to get in the way, eh?
%yuenia_311%	Hah, I don't want you taking the credit later.
%yuenia_312%	Haha, I see.
%yuenia_313%	Thank you, in any case.
%yuenia_317%	Thank you so much.
%yuenia_320%	Now... I can't wait anymore. Legend is spreading fast within the coven.
%yuenia_321%	I want to see your new deck, please. No. I want to experience it.
%yuenia_324%	I don't think that's a good idea...
%yuenia_325%	Ok, but... First I should warn you about its true nature.
%yuenia_329%	I don't think that's a good idea...
%yuenia_331%	Oh... Why?
%yuenia_332%	Haven't you been reading it for many Witches since you've been allowed to receive visits again?
%yuenia_333%	That's right, but... I just recently discovered the truth about my talents.
%yuenia_334%	...What truth?
%yuenia_338%	Mmm... First I should warn you about its true nature.
%yuenia_340%	Oh, and what may that be?
%yuenia_342%	Aedana's corpse visited me not long ago, and explained why she sent me to exile.
%yuenia_343%	She realized it way before any of us... that what I do is not fortune telling.
%yuenia_344%	I'm not reading into the unknown, I'm writing it.
%yuenia_345%	I can modify not only the future, but everything that didn't happen in the past.
%yuenia_346%	I can basically alter reality.
%yuenia_347%	Aedana's always been quite perceptive...
%yuenia_349%	I'm ashamed that I didn't notice it before, being the closest to you and your magical development.
%yuenia_350%	I could have guided you better should we have known about this earlier...
%yuenia_351%	You taught me perfectly... Plus I was happier before learning what my powers actually entail.
%yuenia_352%	Oh... so... your prediction about the fall of the coven...
%yuenia_353%	Yes, I doomed us all.
%yuenia_354%	I see...
%yuenia_355%	I guess that's in part why I got into politics, in hopes there's a way to minimize the damage.
%yuenia_356%	Knowing that... Do you still want to subject yourself to my new deck?
%yuenia_358%	Yes.
%yuenia_359%	Oh.
%yuenia_360%	It's my responsibility. I brought you up.
%yuenia_361%	Just... be mindful about what you ask. I do interpret the cards, but I don't control what card I'll draw.
%yuenia_362%	Very well.
%yuenia_363%	Ok, deep breaths...
%zira_2%	Thanks for having me. My name is Zira, I am a Jade Sculptor.
%zira_3%	Welcome, Zira. My name is Fortuna, I'm a cartomancer.
%zira_4%	What can I do for you?
%zira_5%	I lead a group of refugee Witches, we...
%zira_7%	...
%zira_8%	We are in desperate need of help.
%zira_11%	I'm so sorry to hear that...
%zira_12%	Oh, no! I'll help in any way I can!
%zira_13%	Am I in trouble for hosting you?
%zira_17%	I'm so sorry to hear that...
%zira_18%	Take your time, tell me what happened.
%zira_22%	Oh, no! I'll help in any way I can!
%zira_23%	What do you need?
%zira_27%	Am I in trouble for hosting you?
%zira_28%	...
%zira_30%	I should be frank with you...
%zira_32%	I don't know.
%zira_33%	My hope is that my former coven doesn't want to take it as far as confronting your powerful sisterhood just to take us back.
%zira_34%	I see...
%zira_35%	What happened, exactly?
%zira_38%	Mmm...
%zira_39%	I should first tell you about the nature of the conflict.
%zira_40%	And for you to properly comprehend what's going on, it's imperative that you learn about our culture.
%zira_41%	Are you familiar with the traditions of the Jade Sculptors?
%zira_44%	Not much. Please, educate me.
%zira_45%	Yes.
%zira_46%	(Access Aedana's knowledge about Jade Sculptors.)
%zira_50%	Not much. Please, educate me.
%zira_51%	With pleasure. Thank you for listening to our story.
%zira_52%	We, the Jade Sculptors, are specialized in dialoguing with precious stones.
%zira_53%	We can ask them what their potential is and carve any of them into magnificent magical tools.
%zira_54%	The most powerful stone is Jade, the cornerstone of all our power. We owe all of our might to the pact we sealed with the Jade Monks.
%zira_55%	You work with men? I thought they weren't able to achieve Witchhood.
%zira_56%	Oh, no, the Jade Monks are the two largest known Jade Stones in the universe, each the size of a five-story pagoda.
%zira_57%	They whispered their shape to our founding members, and they carved them into what they are today.
%zira_58%	We worship them, and in exchange, they guard the souls of every member of the clan.
%zira_59%	If you bring the heart of a Jade Witch back to the Jade Monks, we can be born again, but as a mortal, retaining our memories but not our powers.
%zira_60%	The reborn must remain there in our temple, to humbly serve the living Witches of our coven.
%zira_61%	That's very interesting. Thank you so much for taking the time to explain it to me.
%zira_62%	Now that you know how we function, you can understand the root of this conflict...
%zira_66%	Yes.
%zira_67%	Oh. You impress me with your knowledge.
%zira_68%	I'll proceed to explain the root of the conflict, then.
%zira_72%	I know that you, the Jade Sculptors, are specialized in dialoguing with precious stones to ask them about their potential, and that you can carve any of them into magnificent magic tools.
%zira_73%	The most powerful stone being Jade, right?
%zira_74%	Of course.
%zira_75%	Jade is the cornerstone of all your power, since you owe your might to the pact you sealed with the Jade Monks.
%zira_76%	Oh, you even know about the Jade Monks?
%zira_77%	Yes. They are the two largest known Jade Stones in the universe, each the size of a five-story pagoda.
%zira_78%	They whispered their shape to your founding members, and those Witches carved them into what they are today.
%zira_79%	You worship them, and in exchange, they guard the souls of every member of your clan.
%zira_80%	If you bring the heart of a Jade Witch back to the Jade Monks, they can be born again, but as a mortal, retaining their memories but not their powers.
%zira_81%	Those reborn must stay in your temple to serve the living Witches of your coven.
%zira_82%	I am so honored and impressed by your vast knowledge.
%zira_83%	My heart is at ease that you will fully comprehend the nature of our current conflict.
%zira_87%	I found a way of retaining power and immortality when rebirthing at the Jade Monk waterfalls.
%zira_88%	It's all thanks to a new stone carving method I devised, which consists of imbuing quicksilver into the veins of raw Jade.
%zira_90%	But our sisters considered this to be heresy.
%zira_92%	They claim that the purity of Jade must be preserved...
%zira_93%	...but I suspect they are mostly interested in not losing the influx of mortal servants.
%zira_94%	Some of us, a minority I must say, tried to defend the virtue of imbuing Jade with metals, however...
%zira_96%	They declared us heretics and are hunting us down.
%zira_97%	Ugh... that sounds awful.
%zira_99%	That's why we need your help.
%zira_100%	And I'm aware of how risky it is to protect us at the moment.
%zira_101%	But hear me out. I came up with a proposal that may benefit us both.
%zira_102%	Uh... ok, let's hear it.
%zira_103%	I researched many covens to see who'd be the best suited to give us asylum, and yours is one of the most powerful.
%zira_104%	I also learned that your sisterhood works on the basis of invitation. If any sister vouches for another Witch, they can become a rightful member of your coven immediately.
%zira_105%	And I happen to know that you are in the middle of some elections too.
%zira_107%	So...
%zira_109%	Invite me and my nine sisters to your coven and we will all vote for you in the upcoming elections.
%zira_110%	Wow, that's...
%zira_111%	We also have some magic saved up, so as compensation for all your trouble, we can offer you 10 units of Earth energy.
%zira_112%	I know the Jade Sculptors don't have the capacity to mess with a coven as powerful as yours.
%zira_113%	Take us in and we will all be safe.
%zira_115%	Please, I beg you.
%zira_116%	Protect us and you will have ten more votes and more Earth energy!
%zira_119%	I'm sorry, I can't do that.
%zira_120%	Very well, I accept.
%zira_121%	I accept, but no need to vote for me.
%zira_126%	I'm sorry, I can't do that.
%zira_127%	It's not only that it's unfair for my opponents, it's also that I can't chance an inter-coven conflict during such complicated times for my sisterhood.
%zira_129%	Please! You are our only hope!
%zira_130%	We'll become your servants for a decade if necessary!
%zira_133%	I'm sorry, I must ask you to leave.
%zira_134%	I can help you with my cards.
%zira_139%	I'm sorry, I must ask you to leave.
%zira_141%	You are sending us to our death.
%zira_142%	I am terribly sorry. I truly am.
%zira_143%	But I can't afford to get involved. Please understand.
%zira_144%	...
%zira_145%	Thank you for receiving me...
%zira_150%	I can help you with my cards.
%zira_151%	Help with the cards? How?
%zira_154%	(Tell her the truth about your powers.)
%zira_155%	(Act as a regular fortune teller.)
%zira_160%	I can rewrite your fate.
%zira_161%	Can you really do that? ...How?
%zira_162%	I recently discovered that what I do is not exactly fortune telling.
%zira_163%	I can nudge the Cosmic Wheel and... alter reality.
%zira_164%	But that is... Too much power for a single Witch to handle.
%zira_167%	Well, do you want my help or not?
%zira_168%	You're right, maybe I shouldn't do this...
%zira_172%	Well, do you want my help or not?
%zira_173%	Ah...
%zira_175%	...
%zira_176%	Yes, please.
%zira_178%	I understand the ethical pickle of all this, believe me.
%zira_179%	But for now, I have this power, and I can help people, so it is what it is.
%zira_181%	You're right.
%zira_182%	Help us, please.
%zira_184%	Alright, let me get my cards.
%zira_189%	You're right, maybe I shouldn't do this...
%zira_190%	Ah...
%zira_192%	...
%zira_193%	I was just shocked at the fact that Witches as powerful as you exist in this cosmos.
%zira_194%	But, please, we are desperate, we need your help.
%zira_197%	I'm sorry, I changed my mind.
%zira_198%	Ah... alright, I will help.
%zira_202%	I'm sorry, I changed my mind.
%zira_204%	No!
%zira_205%	I can't risk messing with other coven's conflicts.
%zira_206%	I don't really know the whole picture...
%zira_207%	Messing with the fate of a whole sisterhood is too much responsibility.
%zira_209%	...
%zira_213%	Ah... alright, I will help.
%zira_217%	I can take a look at your future and your enemies' future.
%zira_219%	Enemies, huh... my own sisters...
%zira_220%	I'm sorry for putting it that way...
%zira_221%	But you'll be able to deal with this situation better with some additional knowledge as to what to expect next.
%zira_223%	Any kind of help is welcome, yes...
%zira_224%	Thank you.
%zira_229%	Very well, I accept.
%zira_231%	By the Jade Monks! Is that true?
%zira_232%	Yes, I can't morally turn you away.
%zira_233%	Our coven will protect you.
%zira_234%	Thank you so much, you are saving our lives.
%zira_235%	We will support you with all our might.
%zira_236%	Not only with our votes, but also our magic.
%zira_237%	Whatever we can do for you. We are forever indebted.
%zira_238%	I only did what was right.
%zira_240%	Please, here, accept our Jade Earth energy.
%zira_242%	Thank you so much.
%zira_244%	How do we proceed now?
%zira_247%	I can examine your future with my cards.
%zira_248%	I could write you a new future with my cards.
%zira_249%	Get some rest, meet with the rest of the coven.
%zira_253%	I can examine your future with my cards.
%zira_254%	Oh, that'll give me some peace, yes.
%zira_255%	It'll be my pleasure then.
%zira_260%	I could write you a new future with my cards.
%zira_261%	Come again? Write?
%zira_262%	That's right. I possess the ability to affect the Cosmic Wheel.
%zira_263%	I don't have absolute control over what'll happen, but my predictions aren't just predictions.
%zira_264%	I can foresee a variety of futures and nudge the Cosmic Wheel in a certain direction.
%zira_265%	Your power never ceases to amaze me, Witch Fortuna.
%zira_266%	Would you like me to take a look at your possible futures?
%zira_267%	Yes, please.
%zira_271%	Get some rest, meet with the rest of the coven.
%zira_273%	I can't believe we're going to be able to stop running at last...
%zira_275%	You can't possibly know how grateful I am.
%zira_276%	Me and my sisters will remember this act of kindness for the rest of our lives.
%zira_277%	I'm just happy to help some fellow Witches.
%zira_278%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%zira_279%	And good luck with your personal quest.
%zira_280%	Thank you. Rest yourselves up.
%zira_286%	I accept, but no need to vote for me.
%zira_288%	Is... that right? Would you take us in without asking for anything in exchange?
%zira_291%	Well, I would still love that Earth energy.
%zira_292%	That's right. I'll protect you.
%zira_296%	Well, I would still love that Earth energy.
%zira_297%	Ah! But of course!
%zira_301%	That's right. I'll protect you.
%zira_302%	No strings attached, I just want to help. You don't even need to participate in this election.
%zira_303%	You are too kind.
%zira_304%	I couldn't have hoped for such a selfless soul when I came up with this desperate plan.
%zira_305%	Thank you, truly.
%zira_306%	I'm just happy to offer you some peace.
%zira_308%	Thank you so much.
%zira_309%	We've been through too much...
%zira_311%	We are forever indebted to you.
%zira_312%	Really, I'm just happy to help.
%spread_cupressa_intro_2%	Tell me what it is you wish to ask the cards.
%spread_cupressa_intro_3%	There is only one thing on my mind. Something really dear to me.
%spread_cupressa_intro_4%	Will I be able to safeguard Aedana's legacy?
%spread_cupressa_intro_6%	Of all the eras I've lived through, Aedana's has been the most peaceful and prosperous.
%spread_cupressa_intro_7%	At the expense of some of her sisters, but sure.
%spread_cupressa_intro_8%	Please, don't poison the reading with your resentment. That's improper of an oracle.
%spread_cupressa_intro_9%	You're right.
%spread_cupressa_intro_10%	I will focus on your honest will.
%spread_cupressa_intro_11%	Think about Aedana while I shuffle my deck.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_6%	No, but you will make peace with it and find new forms of happiness.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_7%	...
%spread_cupressa_legacy_8%	What's up? Happiness is always good news, isn't it?
%spread_cupressa_legacy_9%	Happiness means nothing to me.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_10%	What I want is for Aedana's work to be eternal.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_11%	Nothing is eternal.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_12%	I know.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_13%	I knew this endeavor was meaningless from the moment I set out to do it.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_14%	But still, I needed to try.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_15%	Will you give up now?
%spread_cupressa_legacy_16%	No. Even if it's just the tiniest fraction, keeping some of Aedana's legacy alive is priceless.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_17%	I see...
%spread_cupressa_legacy_22%	Yes, the coven will idolize Aedana and her sacrifice. Most will follow her philosophy even if it's not the official rule anymore.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_23%	Ah... that is wonderful. It's even better than I'd hoped.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_24%	I was worried that if Dahlia rose to power, she'd undo everything Aedana worked so hard to build.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_25%	That was my main reason for running for leader myself.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_26%	But now that I know I can trust in our sisters' judgment I feel there's a bright future ahead for our coven.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_27%	Will you drop out of the race, then?
%spread_cupressa_legacy_28%	No. I still feel we should keep Aedana's corpse with us for guidance.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_29%	I will fight for her.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_30%	A bit creepy, but sure.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_35%	You will steal one of Aedana's masks and drop out of the race. You will leave the coven and start a cult to follow the mask's whispers.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_36%	...
%spread_cupressa_legacy_37%	That's one of my contingency plans... How did you...?
%spread_cupressa_legacy_38%	Well, you wouldn't be an oracle if you didn't tap into the unknown, of course.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_39%	So it'll come to that, huh...
%spread_cupressa_legacy_40%	Maybe that's for the best?
%spread_cupressa_legacy_41%	The coven seems to be ready to drift away from Aedana's vision.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_42%	None of us besides you seem to plan to adhere to it, in any case.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_43%	And let's be honest, you're not this race's favorite.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_44%	I know. I'm not an idiot.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_45%	But still, I had to try.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_46%	I am going to keep trying, in fact.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_47%	So I can spread my message, and when I leave the coven, more Witches will follow me.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_48%	Suit yourself.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_53%	No, the pressure of this race will become so unbearable that you will lose your mind. Nothing will matter after that.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_54%	...
%spread_cupressa_legacy_55%	That is impossible.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_56%	I've survived for thousands of years. I've seen true horrors, all kinds of chaos and desolation.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_57%	This petty race won't make a dent in my mind.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_58%	Maybe it'll come in the shape of illumination?
%spread_cupressa_legacy_59%	Your mind will transcend?
%spread_cupressa_legacy_60%	No. You are wrong.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_61%	You're just trying to mess with me to drive me out of the race.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_62%	I'm afraid not a single prediction of mine has failed to happen, Cupressa.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_63%	May this be the first one.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_68%	The coven will respect Aedana's contributions, but as time passes, it'll inevitably progress towards new ideas.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_69%	...
%spread_cupressa_legacy_70%	I knew this endeavor was meaningless from the moment I set out to do it.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_71%	It doesn't matter how hard we try, nothing lasts forever.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_72%	I know.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_73%	I guess that raising respect for Aedana's legacy is still a worthy objective.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_74%	I'll try to keep it alive for as long as I can.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_75%	I am not forever, either, after all.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_76%	I hope my cards have helped you in some way.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_77%	Yes, they opened my eyes to an obvious truth. That's the most valuable gift an oracle can offer.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_82%	Yes, many Witches will follow Aedana's philosophy even if it's not the official rule anymore. However, you will pay a high price to keep her legacy alive.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_83%	That's great to know.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_84%	Mmm? Aren't you worried about the price?
%spread_cupressa_legacy_85%	No. Personal price doesn't mean anything to me.
%spread_cupressa_legacy_86%	All is good. This is great news.
%spread_cupressa_followup_3%	Thank you for allowing me to peek into the future, Fortuna.
%spread_cupressa_followup_5%	And thanks for having me at your home.
%spread_cupressa_followup_6%	Good luck with the race.
%spread_cupressa_followup_7%	Good luck to you too.
%spread_cupressa_followup_12%	...
%spread_cupressa_followup_14%	I need to go now.
%spread_cupressa_followup_15%	Thanks for coming, Cupressa.
%spread_cupressa_followup_16%	Good luck with the race.
%spread_cupressa_followup_17%	Goodbye.
%spread_kurielle_intro_2%	Well, I want to find a way to make an impact on the future of the coven.
%spread_kurielle_intro_3%	Like... I can't physically alter anything, but...
%spread_kurielle_intro_4%	Can my illusions help our sisters in a substantial way in these times of change?
%spread_kurielle_intro_6%	I understand.
%spread_kurielle_intro_7%	Focus on your fondest memories of experiencing your powers while I shuffle my deck.
%spread_kurielle_help_6%	Make everyone envision what a more powerful version of themselves would be like.
%spread_kurielle_help_7%	Oh. Wow.
%spread_kurielle_help_9%	Like a coven-wide illusory pep talk?
%spread_kurielle_help_10%	Yeah, I guess so?
%spread_kurielle_help_12%	I've never thought about a use for illusions beyond leisure or deception.
%spread_kurielle_help_13%	To help others envision ideas or possible futures...
%spread_kurielle_help_15%	That's a great idea!
%spread_kurielle_help_16%	Thank you, little cards!
%spread_kurielle_help_21%	Allow every Witch to perceive the utopic version of every candidate's program.
%spread_kurielle_help_23%	Oh?
%spread_kurielle_help_24%	Like... get all the points in every program and create a massive illusion...
%spread_kurielle_help_25%	...And feature the wonders of a community built like that?
%spread_kurielle_help_26%	I suppose?
%spread_kurielle_help_27%	I mean, this is what the cards are prompting you to do. How you go about it is totally up to you.
%spread_kurielle_help_29%	Ok! Challenge accepted!
%spread_kurielle_help_30%	I'll create illusory realms for each program so Witches can visit them and form a better opinion on who to support.
%spread_kurielle_help_31%	Like a political theme park or something like that.
%spread_kurielle_help_33%	Urgh... Put like that sounds super lame...
%spread_kurielle_help_34%	Hahahaha.
%spread_kurielle_help_36%	I'll make it work!
%spread_kurielle_help_37%	Thank you for the guidance!
%spread_kurielle_help_42%	Make everyone visualize the worst thing that could happen.
%spread_kurielle_help_44%	That sounds terrible...
%spread_kurielle_help_45%	But I guess it'll make everyone take the election as seriously as possible?
%spread_kurielle_help_46%	I guess, I mean, nightmares are how the subconscious prepares us to deal with the unexpected, right?
%spread_kurielle_help_47%	Yeah... but I never thought about torturing anyone's mind through sensorial magic...
%spread_kurielle_help_48%	It's up to you how you go about it.
%spread_kurielle_help_49%	Mmm...
%spread_kurielle_help_51%	I guess I should Witch up and see this through.
%spread_kurielle_help_52%	I wanted a way to impact this cosmos, right?
%spread_kurielle_help_53%	It doesn't get more impactful than this, I suppose.
%spread_kurielle_help_54%	That's a good way to see it, yeah.
%spread_kurielle_help_55%	Thank you so much for your guidance.
%spread_kurielle_help_60%	Take our sisters' minds off the race, help them relax.
%spread_kurielle_help_62%	Oh? What do you mean?
%spread_kurielle_help_63%	Like... sensorial TV to chill to?
%spread_kurielle_help_64%	Haha, what? What's that?
%spread_kurielle_help_66%	It's what your reading inspired in me. Like...
%spread_kurielle_help_68%	Create a sensorial realm for Witches to connect to with their minds and forget about the cosmos for a while?
%spread_kurielle_help_69%	That does sound cool.
%spread_kurielle_help_71%	Yeah? Do you think it's a good idea?
%spread_kurielle_help_72%	Absolutely. I see myself using it, for sure.
%spread_kurielle_help_73%	Alright! I'm going to set up something along those lines then!
%spread_kurielle_help_74%	Thank you!
%spread_kurielle_help_79%	Project the kind of experiences we'd access if we were to welcome and befriend more Witches into our coven.
%spread_kurielle_help_81%	Oh? Like a coven-wide premonition of a hypothetical future?
%spread_kurielle_help_82%	Eh... I guess so.
%spread_kurielle_help_84%	Mmm... interesting.
%spread_kurielle_help_85%	A lot of the time we fail to really understand what we really want until we get there.
%spread_kurielle_help_87%	I hope this helps everyone form a better idea of what kind of coven they want to build.
%spread_kurielle_help_92%	Help every Witch to put themselves in their sisters' shoes.
%spread_kurielle_help_94%	Oh?
%spread_kurielle_help_95%	Use sensorial magic to allow Witches to experience other Witches' existences?
%spread_kurielle_help_96%	Or however this reading inspires you, really.
%spread_kurielle_help_98%	No, no. It's a fantastic idea!
%spread_kurielle_help_99%	I feel a surge of purpose running through my veins!
%spread_kurielle_help_100%	A coven-wide ultra empathetic experience!
%spread_kurielle_help_101%	This can only be a good thing. It's gonna bring peace for sure.
%spread_kurielle_help_102%	That's what I call making an impact in this cosmos.
%spread_kurielle_help_103%	Yes!!
%spread_kurielle_help_104%	Thank you so much, Fortuna!
%spread_kurielle_followup_2%	Well, there you have it.
%spread_kurielle_followup_4%	That's it? Easy as that?
%spread_kurielle_followup_5%	Yup. I'm sorry there aren't any fireworks or anything.
%spread_kurielle_followup_6%	Haha, no, I mean, I'm very impressed.
%spread_kurielle_followup_7%	I love how straightforward it is! Plus the art on the cards is super cool, I'd love to see more of them.
%spread_kurielle_followup_8%	I may become a regular!
%spread_kurielle_followup_9%	You're very welcome to come back any time you want.
%spread_kurielle_followup_10%	Yay!
%spread_kurielle_followup_12%	I'm going to head out now. I'm eager to start exploring this new purpose the cards have shown me!
%spread_kurielle_followup_13%	Go get them.
%spread_kurielle_followup_14%	Thanks!!
%spread_rangimarie_followup_2%	Fortuna. This is extremely good.
%spread_rangimarie_followup_4%	Let me bind everything together in a spell.
%spread_rangimarie_followup_5%	I can't wait to listen to it. My mind will be welcoming for this one, haha.
%spread_rangimarie_followup_6%	Ready?
%spread_rangimarie_hook_4%	Whoa!
%spread_rangimarie_hook_6%	Powerful! You bet it caught my attention!
%spread_rangimarie_intro_2%	How do we go about this?
%spread_rangimarie_intro_4%	Ok, so, cosmic poems are composed of three important elements.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_5%	I'd like you to ask the cards to look into each of them.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_6%	Ah! Also, before we get started, please forget everything you know about human poetry.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_7%	These are spells unbound by language. In fact, everyone perceives them in their native tongue.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_8%	So forget about rhyme, metric, and all that bullshit.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_9%	This is the real deal... just powerful ideas.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_10%	Like...
%spread_rangimarie_intro_12%	Like a hit Tweet.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_13%	What's a Tweet?
%spread_rangimarie_intro_15%	Oh, you're a pre-internet witch, I see.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_16%	When are you from?
%spread_rangimarie_intro_17%	I ascended in the early 60s, from Planet Earth's United States.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_18%	Right. So, like... graffiti that you read somewhere and find yourself thinking about it again and again.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_19%	Gotcha.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_20%	When are you from, by the way?
%spread_rangimarie_intro_22%	Nowhere, nowhen, literally.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_23%	I woke up inside a collapsed star. Where space and time stop making sense.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_25%	I've never been a mortal.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_26%	But I really dig the human vibe.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_27%	Oh, wow.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_28%	(...Is that even possible?)
%spread_rangimarie_intro_29%	Anyway, cosmic poems 101:
%spread_rangimarie_intro_31%	The first and most crucial element is the Hook.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_33%	A conceptual gust that pries open your mind.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_34%	It readies you to absorb the energy of the poem.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_36%	Second comes the Line.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_38%	The substance, the development of the idea.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_39%	And third, and quite critical, there's the Sinker.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_42%	It's what drives everything home. It seals the deal.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_43%	Reaches for the depths of your soul and delivers the cosmic poem.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_45%	Are you following?
%spread_rangimarie_intro_46%	Hook, line and sinker. Got it.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_47%	The idea is to develop a cosmic poem that makes Witches connect better with your cause.
%spread_rangimarie_intro_48%	Right. So...
%spread_rangimarie_intro_49%	Focus on what inspired you to support us while I shuffle my deck.
%spread_rangimarie_line_4%	For the first black hole, there's so much meaning engraved in that.
%spread_rangimarie_line_6%	This may turn out to be the deepest poem of my career.
%spread_rangimarie_line_7%	And I didn't even have to actually write it.
%spread_rangimarie_sinker_4%	Shit. This sinker is a game changer.
%spread_rangimarie_sinker_6%	I love it.
%spread_wunn_followup_3%	So...
%spread_wunn_followup_6%	It's a shame we couldn't really have a conversation.
%spread_wunn_followup_8%	Thanks for coming?
%spread_wunn_followup_13%	Oh, whoa, what is this sensation? I can taste glyphs under my tongue.
%spread_wunn_followup_15%	Is this real? It was as simple as that?
%spread_wunn_followup_16%	Oh! It worked! I can understand you! Yes!
%spread_wunn_followup_17%	This must be one of the most extraordinary displays of power I have ever seen.
%spread_wunn_followup_18%	Hehe... thank you.
%spread_wunn_followup_19%	Should we try this conversation again?
%spread_wunn_intro_2%	I'm going to draw a single card to explore the options our relationship offers.
%spread_wunn_intro_4%	Keep in mind what you came here to do to see if I can channel it in some way.
%spread_wunn_wunn_6%	In a minute, stars will align over my asteroid and bestow upon me the ability to speak the Tongue of the Nebula.
%spread_wunn_wunn_8%	Now that is wishful thinking.
%spread_wunn_wunn_10%	Problem solved then!
%spread_wunn_wunn_15%	Fed up with my incompetence, and worried about the dire prospects for our coven, you will convince a group of academics to abandon the sisterhood and become independent.
%spread_wunn_wunn_17%	Really? Is this coven really that hopeless since we lost Aedana?
%spread_wunn_wunn_19%	...I'm sorry.
%spread_wunn_wunn_24%	It's hopeless. You and I will never understand each other. But even so, we'll respect and inspire each other for years to come.
%spread_wunn_wunn_26%	Did you really need to consult your deck for that?
%spread_wunn_wunn_27%	I hope the inspiration part is true, because so far I'm not feeling that respect.
%spread_wunn_wunn_29%	Cool.
%spread_wunn_wunn_34%	Disappointed in me, you will go to Cupressa and find in her the connection we couldn't build here. You will help her boost her chances considerably.
%spread_wunn_wunn_36%	You must be very sure of yourself if you can afford to read such a prediction out loud.
%spread_wunn_wunn_38%	That sucks for me, yeah.
%spread_wunn_wunn_43%	Even though we are unable to talk to each other, you will feel greatly inspired by my presence and will support our cause regardless.
%spread_wunn_wunn_45%	Is that right? So far you're not doing a great job.
%spread_wunn_wunn_47%	That is fantastic!
%spread_yu_followup_2%	Anyway...
%spread_yu_followup_3%	What do you think about my true talents?
%spread_yu_followup_5%	I understand why Aedana was scared enough to deprive you of your old deck.
%spread_yu_followup_6%	But I'm not scared at all, because I know you. Aedana didn't. She made a grave mistake.
%spread_yu_followup_7%	If Aedana had told you the truth, you would have treated your newfound power with care, I have no doubt about it.
%spread_yu_followup_8%	But sentencing you to a millennium of exile? That's dangerous. You could have gone insane, and...
%spread_yu_followup_10%	I don't even want to think about a mad Witch with the power to alter reality.
%spread_yu_followup_12%	I'm so glad I taught you the song to summon Ábramar.
%spread_yu_followup_13%	Wait, you know Ábramar?
%spread_yu_followup_14%	Not personally, but my mentor did. She taught me the forbidden song and told many tales about Ábramar.
%spread_yu_followup_15%	But I never got to use the spell myself.
%spread_yu_followup_18%	Wait, tell me more about your mentor and Ábramar.
%spread_yu_followup_19%	Pity.
%spread_yu_followup_24%	Wait, tell me more about your mentor and Ábramar.
%spread_yu_followup_25%	My mentor was a Sumerian Witch, master of shapeshifting.
%spread_yu_followup_26%	She was one of the founders of our coven. Apparently they had to dispel Ábramar because one of the sisters made a pact that endangered the fabric of time itself.
%spread_yu_followup_27%	My mentor rarely talked about the incident because it brought her sour memories that tainted her transformations, but they had to erase their sister out of existence.
%spread_yu_followup_28%	And chained Ábramar back into the forbidden song.
%spread_yu_followup_29%	I know Ábramar isn't happy about that.
%spread_yu_followup_30%	I'm sure. And my mentor felt quite sorry for everything, but what could they do... the price was too high.
%spread_yu_followup_31%	In any case, my mentor spoke fondly about their time with Ábramar. I'm kind of sad I never got to summon him myself.
%spread_yu_followup_35%	Pity.
%spread_yu_followup_37%	To be honest, it's frustrating that I never got to chant the forbidden song.
%spread_yu_followup_38%	All these years of temptation, waiting for a valid excuse... hah.
%spread_yu_followup_41%	How are you liking him?
%spread_yu_followup_44%	I like him very much... I owe him my life.
%spread_yu_followup_45%	I don't really trust him.
%spread_yu_followup_46%	I both hate him and love him.
%spread_yu_followup_47%	I don't know. The Behemoth is just a tool to me.
%spread_yu_followup_52%	I like him very much... I owe him my life.
%spread_yu_followup_54%	I'm so happy to hear that. I'm glad you found such a good ally.
%spread_yu_followup_55%	It's rare to hear you talk so fondly about anybody.
%spread_yu_followup_56%	I guess that extradimensional beings are my weak spot.
%spread_yu_followup_58%	Hah.
%spread_yu_followup_63%	I don't really trust him.
%spread_yu_followup_65%	Oh... Why's that?
%spread_yu_followup_66%	Are you in trouble?
%spread_yu_followup_67%	I don't know...
%spread_yu_followup_68%	He's helped me so far, but Ábramar is so difficult to read.
%spread_yu_followup_69%	I can't really tell what his true intentions are.
%spread_yu_followup_71%	I see...
%spread_yu_followup_72%	Well, it got you out of exile, at least.
%spread_yu_followup_73%	If things get out of hand just let me know and we'll stop him together, ok?
%spread_yu_followup_74%	Ok... thank you.
%spread_yu_followup_75%	Whatever you need, Fortuna.
%spread_yu_followup_76%	Actually, I want to give you something to enrich that deck of yours.
%spread_yu_followup_81%	I both hate him and love him.
%spread_yu_followup_82%	Oh, heh...
%spread_yu_followup_83%	Those are the best ones, aren't they?
%spread_yu_followup_84%	Yu-ënia!
%spread_yu_followup_85%	It's true, the ones who keep your energies in disarray...
%spread_yu_followup_87%	...ah, to be alive!
%spread_yu_followup_88%	It's not like that.
%spread_yu_followup_89%	Ábramar is very helpful, but he won't stop messing with me.
%spread_yu_followup_90%	Always putting uncomfortable thoughts in my head.
%spread_yu_followup_92%	That's good. I'm happy to hear your new partner keeps challenging you.
%spread_yu_followup_93%	Yay...
%spread_yu_followup_98%	I don't know. The Behemoth is just a tool to me.
%spread_yu_followup_100%	Oh, that's cold.
%spread_yu_followup_101%	Is Ábramar that dull?
%spread_yu_followup_102%	From what I heard from my mentor I thought he was this kind of charismatic entity, like...
%spread_yu_followup_103%	Someone nice to have around.
%spread_yu_followup_104%	I mean, he talks a lot.
%spread_yu_followup_105%	But we mustn't lose sight of what he actually is.
%spread_yu_followup_106%	Ábramar is a dangerous being that I'm using to get out of a desperate situation. We shouldn't get attached to him, or...
%spread_yu_followup_108%	You're afraid of being let down, I see.
%spread_yu_followup_109%	No, it's not that, it's...
%spread_yu_followup_110%	Maybe.
%spread_yu_followup_111%	I don't know.
%spread_yu_followup_112%	It's ok. I understand.
%spread_yu_followup_113%	It's good that you are keeping your guard up, in any case. You're right.
%spread_yu_followup_117%	Listen, I want you to have something.
%spread_yu_followup_119%	I believe my dominion may prove a very powerful sphere for your creations.
%spread_yu_followup_120%	The four elements converge there, after all.
%spread_yu_intro_2%	What future do you want to alter?
%spread_yu_intro_3%	Not the future. If I understood you properly, we can work with everything that didn't happen right?
%spread_yu_intro_4%	Oh, right.
%spread_yu_intro_5%	I can't erase anything, but I can sew in new realities.
%spread_yu_intro_6%	Especially around times where our collective memories are fuzzy...
%spread_yu_intro_7%	Times in which nothing of worth seemed to happen.
%spread_yu_intro_8%	I understand.
%spread_yu_intro_10%	Then... I want you to write us a happy memory and an important lesson.
%spread_yu_intro_13%	Oh, that's unexpected.
%spread_yu_intro_14%	What's this about? Regret? Disappointment...?
%spread_yu_intro_15%	I did so much thinking when Aedana took you away from me.
%spread_yu_intro_16%	And I feel I should have been less strict and put more time into enjoying ourselves.
%spread_yu_intro_17%	Now you're telling me you have the power to fix that, so...
%spread_yu_intro_19%	Let's see if you can turn me into a better mentor, even retroactively.
%spread_yu_intro_20%	Wow. Ok.
%spread_yu_intro_21%	Focus on your pride and your compassion while I shuffle my deck.
%spread_yu_lesson_symbol_2%	As I once taught you, the opaline squirrel can channel the four elements at the same time, so it may prove a powerful combination with just about any arcana.
%spread_yu_lesson_symbol_3%	I'm looking forward to creating a card with it; thank you so much, Yu-ënia.
%spread_yu_lesson_symbol_4%	It is my pleasure.
%spread_yu_lesson_6%	You taught me to create a magical stash that would slowly grow during my penance... So I would have a meaty magical reserve ready for when I came back.
%spread_yu_lesson_7%	Oh, yes, I remember that.
%spread_yu_lesson_8%	And don't call it a "magical stash." It was an Astrologer's Dreamcatcher.
%spread_yu_lesson_9%	After two hundred years it must be ripe for the harvest.
%spread_yu_lesson_10%	Whoa, it's so uncanny, you immediately switched to that reality...
%spread_yu_lesson_12%	Ah, oh...
%spread_yu_lesson_13%	I cast the spell myself and I could swear this really happened.
%spread_yu_lesson_15%	Well, it really happened. I remember it clearly.
%spread_yu_lesson_16%	What you cast wasn't an illusion, after all. We lived through that.
%spread_yu_lesson_17%	True. Amazing.
%spread_yu_lesson_18%	Do you want to open it now? See how much energy it gathered?
%spread_yu_lesson_19%	Absolutely.
%spread_yu_lesson_20%	Ok, here I go.
%spread_yu_lesson_23%	Whoa!
%spread_yu_lesson_24%	Incredible.
%spread_yu_lesson_25%	This feels like cheating.
%spread_yu_lesson_27%	I don't think so. You sacrificed a bit of your past in exchange for this power, the cosmic balance is kept.
%spread_yu_lesson_28%	You'll eventually run out of past if you keep exploiting this.
%spread_yu_lesson_29%	Mmm... Right, but still.
%spread_yu_lesson_30%	Enjoy it, you own it. You used your abilities and your own time, after all.
%spread_yu_lesson_31%	I guess.
%spread_yu_lesson_32%	I'm still processing it...
%spread_yu_lesson_37%	You confided in me a way to summon the strength of your familiar, the opaline squirrel, as a conduit to channel the four elements at the same time.
%spread_yu_lesson_38%	Oh, right!
%spread_yu_lesson_39%	How come you didn't summon her yet?
%spread_yu_lesson_40%	Well, I guess I didn't have the chance to put it to good use. I confess I didn't care much about elemental energies during my exile.
%spread_yu_lesson_42%	Come again? But the four elements are--
%spread_yu_lesson_43%	--Everything, I know, I know.
%spread_yu_lesson_45%	I have an idea.
%spread_yu_lesson_46%	Now that I'm seeing your deck in action...
%spread_yu_lesson_47%	I notice the cards are composed of spheres, arcana and energy symbols, right?
%spread_yu_lesson_48%	That's it, good eye.
%spread_yu_lesson_49%	Very well. I shall summon my familiar in a way that will be useful to your new craft.
%spread_yu_lesson_50%	Here.
%spread_yu_lesson_56%	You taught me another forbidden spell to siphon magic from any Witch who visited my dominion.
%spread_yu_lesson_57%	My utter disrespect for the Magical Pact is starting to show, huh...
%spread_yu_lesson_58%	I don't regret it, though. I just wanted to equip you with tools to deal with any situation.
%spread_yu_lesson_59%	I am nothing but grateful for that.
%spread_yu_lesson_60%	Have you been using it?
%spread_yu_lesson_62%	Scarcely. Not since they lifted the ban on visitation, at least.
%spread_yu_lesson_63%	Oh... This... This is interesting.
%spread_yu_lesson_64%	Mmm?
%spread_yu_lesson_65%	We just altered the past, but anything that's been observed cannot be affected, so that's why I haven't been using the spell.
%spread_yu_lesson_66%	The cards keep the universe coherent, so I guess I can stop worrying about any kind of butterfly effect destroying the present as we know it.
%spread_yu_lesson_68%	Oh, I already forgot that you just wrote this into our past, it feels so real...
%spread_yu_lesson_69%	Because it happened. This isn't an illusion, we lived through that day.
%spread_yu_lesson_70%	Extraordinary. This is very interesting indeed.
%spread_yu_lesson_72%	Are you going to start using the siphon, then?
%spread_yu_lesson_73%	Yes.
%spread_yu_lesson_74%	I feel compelled to do it.
%spread_yu_lesson_76%	Is this your decision, or the deck's?
%spread_yu_lesson_77%	Isn't it the same?
%spread_yu_lesson_78%	Mmm... maybe.
%spread_yu_lesson_84%	You taught me oneiromancy to harvest magic from my own dreams.
%spread_yu_lesson_85%	Oh, yeah, I remember!
%spread_yu_lesson_86%	Those were fun days. In the beginning you were having trouble becoming lucid within a dream.
%spread_yu_lesson_87%	The moment you realized you were dreaming you always panicked and woke up.
%spread_yu_lesson_88%	Ah, whoa, yes. I don't remember it as being fun, though; I was so frustrated by it all.
%spread_yu_lesson_89%	Oh, but the moment I mastered it I immediately dream-walked to your mind and gave you a big old scare, haha.
%spread_yu_lesson_91%	That wasn't the fun part.
%spread_yu_lesson_92%	Hahaha.
%spread_yu_lesson_93%	Who would have thought you would be so afraid of beetles.
%spread_yu_lesson_94%	I'm telling you, stag beetles aren't natural. I haven't been able to prove it yet, but they are of Daemonic origin.
%spread_yu_lesson_95%	Hahaha.
%spread_yu_lesson_97%	Ahem... anyway, have you been harvesting energy from your dreams lately?
%spread_yu_lesson_100%	I will try it as soon as I go to sleep next, though.
%spread_yu_lesson_101%	It's getting close to election day, so it's good to know that I'm going to be productive even in my dreams.
%spread_yu_lesson_103%	I'm happy to see my lessons are going to be helpful.
%spread_yu_lesson_104%	Isn't the merit kind of mine, though, if I just wrote that you taught me this?
%spread_yu_lesson_105%	Mmm... Maybe... It doesn't feel like it, though, and that's what counts.
%spread_yu_lesson_106%	Heh, I guess.
%spread_yu_memory_6%	One of my fondest memories is when you accompanied me to Earth to visit my birthplace, and we ended up having too many cocktails in Barcelona.
%spread_yu_memory_8%	Oh, you humans and your obsession with mixing alcohol in delicious ways.
%spread_yu_memory_9%	What was your hometown called, again?
%spread_yu_memory_11%	Tortosa.
%spread_yu_memory_12%	Although I wouldn't call it my hometown, I was just born there. My parents moved to France before I was two.
%spread_yu_memory_13%	I was curious to visit it in person, but I felt like a tourist there, really.
%spread_yu_memory_14%	I liked the cathedral.
%spread_yu_memory_15%	Yeah, it was cool.
%spread_yu_memory_16%	Then we flew away to Barcelona to see how society evolved after you ascended.
%spread_yu_memory_21%	Yeah, this was before that AI rose up to rule humanity.
%spread_yu_memory_24%	Yeah, it was super crowded, overpopulation was becoming a pressing issue.
%spread_yu_memory_25%	Barely a decade later they started with the human-digitization plan.
%spread_yu_memory_28%	Yeah, this was before they started building the domed cities.
%spread_yu_memory_29%	I remember the air in the city was almost poisonous, most people were wearing masks.
%spread_yu_memory_32%	Yeah, it was a few years before the super bacteria decimated humanity, it was so lively!
%spread_yu_memory_35%	Yeah, I remember how everyone was excited about the first passenger trip to Mars.
%spread_yu_memory_37%	I remember the shock of seeing a smartphone for the first time. Life on Earth felt like science-fiction.
%spread_yu_memory_38%	You immediately got yourself one to fiddle with it.
%spread_yu_memory_39%	And after the fourth cocktail you couldn't stop doing those selfie things those German tourists taught you about.
%spread_yu_memory_40%	Hahaha, wow, yeah, I had a lot of fun.
%spread_yu_memory_41%	It's been centuries now and I still feel a bit embarrassed.
%spread_yu_memory_46%	Oh, I remember how your ears went wild the first time I baked you a margarita pizza.
%spread_yu_memory_48%	My ears!?
%spread_yu_memory_49%	Hahahaha, yeah!
%spread_yu_memory_50%	It was during the first months of my training.
%spread_yu_memory_51%	I was getting used to my ascension, and I wanted to do something to thank you for taking me in.
%spread_yu_memory_52%	I asked you if you liked pizza, and you were like...
%spread_yu_memory_54%	What's a pizza?
%spread_yu_memory_55%	Haha, exactly.
%spread_yu_memory_56%	I couldn't believe that in all of your years of immortal existence you hadn't heard about pizza at all.
%spread_yu_memory_57%	Well, it's not like you had any knowledge of Deerfolk gastronomy.
%spread_yu_memory_58%	Haha, I know, I know. But by that time I couldn't process existence without pizza.
%spread_yu_memory_59%	So I went and made you one, the simplest.
%spread_yu_memory_61%	Ah... As I remember it my mouth is beginning to water again...
%spread_yu_memory_62%	And when you put the first slice in your mouth, your eyes went wide open and your ears started going up and down uncontrollably, hahaha.
%spread_yu_memory_64%	Now I need pizza.
%spread_yu_memory_65%	It's been centuries since I had one.
%spread_yu_memory_66%	Next time I visit you, get ready to make some pizza, Fortuna.
%spread_yu_memory_67%	Haha, sure. It's a promise.
%spread_yu_memory_72%	Do you remember that winter in your cabin, when we built a Snow Golem... and how I cried when he melted away?
%spread_yu_memory_74%	Oh, good old Graeme.
%spread_yu_memory_75%	Of course I remember.
%spread_yu_memory_76%	It was part of your automaton arts training.
%spread_yu_memory_78%	You put a lot of effort into creating him, and once the class was over you refused to dispel him.
%spread_yu_memory_79%	So we kept Graeme around for the winter.
%spread_yu_memory_80%	It was just you and me in that cabin, with the occasional visitor once in a blue moon.
%spread_yu_memory_81%	I needed some company that wouldn't be judging me all the time.
%spread_yu_memory_82%	I never told you about this, but... I used to sneak out of bed at night to speak with Graeme.
%spread_yu_memory_83%	I told him all about the life I left behind, and how excited and sad I was at the same time now that I'd become a Witch.
%spread_yu_memory_85%	Oh, so that's why you couldn't stop crying when the spring took him away.
%spread_yu_memory_86%	...It does make sense.
%spread_yu_memory_88%	You hadn't shed a single tear since I'd taken you in.
%spread_yu_memory_89%	But Graeme was the first thing you lost as a Witch.
%spread_yu_memory_90%	It must have triggered all the pain you were holding from losing your mortal self and your mortal loved ones.
%spread_yu_memory_91%	It does make sense in hindsight, yeah...
%spread_yu_memory_92%	After that, your magical talents really started to shine.
%spread_yu_memory_93%	Yeah... I needed to let go.
%spread_yu_memory_98%	I really loved that time you took me camping in one of the beautiful valleys in the Deerfolk realm. It was so peaceful...
%spread_yu_memory_100%	Oh, yes, I feel that's when you finally opened up to me.
%spread_yu_memory_101%	Yes, I remember it too.
%spread_yu_memory_102%	And do you know why that happened?
%spread_yu_memory_103%	Of course, it was that broth we prepared together.
%spread_yu_memory_104%	Foraging for the ingredients, getting water from the river, starting a fire...
%spread_yu_memory_105%	And how comforting it was...
%spread_yu_memory_106%	Ah, when we drank from it in silence, letting it warm us to fight the wet cold of the valley.
%spread_yu_memory_107%	A true bonding experience.
%spread_yu_memory_108%	It was very nice, but that wasn't what made me lower my guard.
%spread_yu_memory_110%	Oh, yeah? What was it then?
%spread_yu_memory_111%	When you fell down on your ass when a grasshopper jumped out of nowhere.
%spread_yu_memory_113%	What!? That!?
%spread_yu_memory_114%	Hahahaha.
%spread_yu_memory_115%	Why!?
%spread_yu_memory_116%	The little scream and the dumb look on your face were priceless.
%spread_yu_memory_117%	And that made you trust me!?
%spread_yu_memory_118%	Absolutely.
%spread_yu_memory_119%	Up to that point you were nothing but perfection, the master of the elements Yu-ënia, oh so wise and faultless.
%spread_yu_memory_120%	But, you fell on your ass.
%spread_yu_memory_122%	Really...
%spread_yu_memory_123%	Suddenly you were within my reach.
%spread_yu_memory_124%	If a millennium-old Witch can fall on her ass, everything is alright.
%spread_yu_memory_125%	I can aim to become that.
%spread_yu_memory_130%	Ah... This is so strange, I know you just wrote that with your cards, but...
%spread_yu_memory_131%	I remember it so vividly, so many details...
%spread_yu_memory_132%	The smells, the temperature, so many sensations...
%spread_yu_memory_133%	Yeah, me too. It's uncanny. I immediately embraced this new reality.
%spread_yu_memory_134%	It's not an illusion, after all. We really lived through that. It actually happened.
%spread_yu_memory_136%	This is incredible.
%spread_yu_memory_137%	Thank you for creating such a valuable memory for us.
%spread_zira_followup_3%	Thank you for looking into our future.
%spread_zira_followup_6%	Somehow it's less bleak than I expected...
%spread_zira_followup_8%	Even if I know there are still many hardships ahead.
%spread_zira_followup_11%	Thank you, really.
%spread_zira_followup_13%	For now, I'll focus on showing proper gratitude for you having taken us in.
%spread_zira_followup_14%	You are saving our lives, in more than one sense.
%spread_zira_followup_16%	I hope everything works out for you all, in the end.
%spread_zira_followup_21%	I only wish I could have convinced you to accept us as your sisters.
%spread_zira_followup_23%	But I understand the difficult position I was putting you in.
%spread_zira_followup_24%	Thank you for the counsel.
%spread_zira_followup_28%	Are things really going to happen as you just wrote?
%spread_zira_followup_29%	Yes.
%spread_zira_followup_33%	Why didn't you write us an ideal future, one in which no one had to suffer?
%spread_zira_followup_34%	I... I can't exactly shape fate to my liking. My cards allow me to envision different futures to take us to.
%spread_zira_followup_35%	But more often than not, there are no ideal paths.
%spread_zira_followup_36%	I'm sorry.
%spread_zira_followup_37%	I see...
%spread_zira_followup_38%	Even so... I am thankful for this alternative future.
%spread_zira_followup_41%	How can you be so powerful?
%spread_zira_followup_42%	This is incredible.
%spread_zira_followup_44%	I still can't believe that we're going to not only survive but thrive, after all we've suffered...
%spread_zira_followup_45%	I just hope you can find happiness.
%spread_zira_followup_48%	If our foresisters really end up acknowledging their mistakes...
%spread_zira_followup_49%	You truly are a fate bender.
%spread_zira_followup_50%	Because after all the hunting... I...
%spread_zira_followup_52%	I still don't believe this is a viable future.
%spread_zira_followup_54%	For now, we can only place our trust in your abilities.
%spread_zira_intro_2%	I see two major forces at play in this predicament, so I'm going to draw a card for each of them.
%spread_zira_intro_4%	On one hand, we have you and your sisters, refugees, fleeing from your old coven.
%spread_zira_intro_5%	And...
%spread_zira_intro_7%	On the other hand, we have your pursuers; the foresisters that are after you, claiming that you are heretics.
%spread_zira_intro_8%	Please, Jade Monks, show mercy upon us...
%spread_zira_intro_9%	Focus on your training as a Jade Sculptor, and on your desires as a Witch, while I shuffle my deck.
%spread_zira_pursuers_6%	No matter where you hide, your foresisters will end up finding a way to punish you all, one way or another.
%spread_zira_pursuers_8%	...
%spread_zira_pursuers_9%	There's no escaping them, then.
%spread_zira_pursuers_15%	I might as well surrender and end this despair altogether.
%spread_zira_pursuers_16%	Well, we still don't know what options you may have. Maybe fate has more in store for you than being punished.
%spread_zira_pursuers_18%	Let's draw another card.
%spread_zira_pursuers_21%	Even with a new coven, a greater coven than theirs, we will still be punished.
%spread_zira_pursuers_23%	Hey, provided it doesn't kill you, immortality has infinite chances in store.
%spread_zira_pursuers_24%	Look at me, I'm just coming out of a 200-year-long exile.
%spread_zira_pursuers_26%	I see...
%spread_zira_pursuers_27%	Finding balance is good, in my opinion.
%spread_zira_pursuers_28%	You may be right, yes.
%spread_zira_pursuers_31%	Even if we go through with the outlandish idea of building a cult around your figure, we'll receive our punishment.
%spread_zira_pursuers_34%	Even if we end up begging for mercy we'll be punished.
%spread_zira_pursuers_35%	Well, punishment doesn't necessarily imply death.
%spread_zira_pursuers_36%	The other card did say that you will make amends, so...
%spread_zira_pursuers_37%	I feel you'll make things work out in the end.
%spread_zira_pursuers_40%	Maybe...
%spread_zira_pursuers_41%	It's a sliver of hope, in any case.
%spread_zira_pursuers_44%	Even losing our Witchhood won't be enough.
%spread_zira_pursuers_45%	Maybe losing your Witchhood is what the punishment leads to?
%spread_zira_pursuers_46%	If you weren't going to actually be able to live as mortal priestesses my cards wouldn't have mentioned it.
%spread_zira_pursuers_47%	So we still don't understand how the pieces will fit together, but you will make it, Zira.
%spread_zira_pursuers_48%	...
%spread_zira_pursuers_51%	We can become an almighty cosmic entity, but they will still manage to get us...
%spread_zira_pursuers_52%	Or maybe the fact that they get to you is what'll push you all to fuse into this cosmic being.
%spread_zira_pursuers_53%	You will get to see the end of this universe, my cards were clear about that.
%spread_zira_pursuers_58%	Your pursuers will eventually realize how ignorant they have been and will try to recruit you back and compensate you and your sisters for all the damage they caused.
%spread_zira_pursuers_60%	...
%spread_zira_pursuers_62%	Hah. That's rich.
%spread_zira_pursuers_68%	They bloodied their hands on our fallen sisters already.
%spread_zira_pursuers_69%	I don't see how they could possibly bring us back into the fold.
%spread_zira_pursuers_70%	Well, let's draw another card to see what'll happen with you and your sisters.
%spread_zira_pursuers_73%	But I guess that if we manage to build that new and improved coven...
%spread_zira_pursuers_74%	There are some talented Sculptors we won't mind having back.
%spread_zira_pursuers_77%	However, you'll lose us as your worshipers if that were to happen, right?
%spread_zira_pursuers_78%	Or maybe the whole of the Jade Sculptor coven could become my followers, who knows.
%spread_zira_pursuers_79%	...
%spread_zira_pursuers_80%	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
%spread_zira_pursuers_81%	You are terrifying, Fortuna.
%spread_zira_pursuers_84%	But I guess it's consistent with that tale about us realizing that we committed heresy.
%spread_zira_pursuers_85%	If we can find some common ground, maybe there's hope for the Jade Sculptors after all.
%spread_zira_pursuers_86%	Thank you.
%spread_zira_pursuers_89%	They'll try to recruit us back even after we renounce our powers?
%spread_zira_pursuers_90%	That would mean working as servants at the Jade Monk Waterfalls...
%spread_zira_pursuers_91%	Back to square one...
%spread_zira_pursuers_92%	But better than being hunted and tortured, I guess...
%spread_zira_pursuers_95%	They'll try to recruit us back once we become an almighty cosmic entity?
%spread_zira_pursuers_96%	I don't see us ever forgiving them for hunting us down.
%spread_zira_pursuers_97%	But that's a hopeful picture, the one you're painting here, yeah.
%spread_zira_pursuers_102%	The Jade Sculptors will devise a ritual to turn all of their dead servants into ghosts and have them haunt the dreams of anyone who betrayed them.
%spread_zira_pursuers_104%	...
%spread_zira_pursuers_105%	Are they really going to send our dead ancestors after us?
%spread_zira_pursuers_107%	I guess that it's better than cosmic erasure, which is the point we're at right now...
%spread_zira_pursuers_109%	But still, haunting our dreams forever...
%spread_zira_pursuers_110%	It's going to make for a difficult existence, no matter which path we take.
%spread_zira_pursuers_112%	Thank you for the heads up, anyway.
%spread_zira_pursuers_117%	The Jade Monks that you worshiped, displeased by the atrocities committed by your foresisters, will turn everyone, except you and the ones who fled, into Jade statues.
%spread_zira_pursuers_119%	...
%spread_zira_pursuers_120%	I don't want to find joy in their tragedy...
%spread_zira_pursuers_122%	But it does sound like proper justice after everything they've put us through.
%spread_zira_pursuers_124%	There's some solace in that.
%spread_zira_pursuers_125%	Thank you.
%spread_zira_pursuers_128%	How does that work with our fate of repenting and trying to make amends with them, though?
%spread_zira_pursuers_129%	A bit tragically, in my opinion.
%spread_zira_pursuers_130%	Realizing you were mistaken after all, just to find all of your sisters turned to stone.
%spread_zira_pursuers_131%	I guess that the reading about making amends here is that maybe you will start serving and worshiping their statues the same way you did with the Jade Monks?
%spread_zira_pursuers_132%	Oh...
%spread_zira_pursuers_134%	...
%spread_zira_pursuers_135%	I'm not really looking forward to that.
%spread_zira_pursuers_136%	I'm sorry.
%spread_zira_pursuers_138%	It's ok. Thank you for your counsel.
%spread_zira_pursuers_143%	The Jade Sculptors will be deemed a danger to cosmic society and will be stopped and dissolved by the Arbitrage Office.
%spread_zira_pursuers_145%	...
%spread_zira_pursuers_147%	Serves them right.
%spread_zira_pursuers_149%	I could cry if I wasn't so utterly exhausted.
%spread_zira_pursuers_152%	The idea of being able to exist beyond the Jade Sculptors gives me some solace.
%spread_zira_pursuers_153%	Surviving them is not something I would have thought possible a few minutes ago.
%spread_zira_pursuers_154%	Thank you...
%spread_zira_pursuers_157%	How does that work with our fate of repenting and trying to make amends with them, though?
%spread_zira_pursuers_158%	A bit tragically, in my opinion.
%spread_zira_pursuers_159%	Realizing you were mistaken after all, just to find all of your sisters arrested, serving as arbiters, or worse.
%spread_zira_pursuers_160%	The amends the card told us about could be trying to rebuild the coven, building a new form of worship for the Jade Monks?
%spread_zira_pursuers_161%	Hah... The irony.
%spread_zira_refugee_6%	You will end up founding your own coven that'll surpass the Jade Sculptors.
%spread_zira_refugee_7%	That...
%spread_zira_refugee_8%	That's not possible.
%spread_zira_refugee_9%	Why not?
%spread_zira_refugee_10%	The Jade Sculptors didn't exist before your ancestors carved the giant Jade stones, right?
%spread_zira_refugee_11%	The possibilities are as endless as time for immortal beings such as you and me.
%spread_zira_refugee_13%	...
%spread_zira_refugee_14%	You're right.
%spread_zira_refugee_16%	I need to start focusing on what's ahead.
%spread_zira_refugee_20%	And what you foretold is something well worth looking forward to.
%spread_zira_refugee_22%	Thank you.
%spread_zira_refugee_25%	It's good to know that we will survive their punishment.
%spread_zira_refugee_27%	Not only that, but we'll get to thrive and maybe even forget this pain one day...
%spread_zira_refugee_30%	You've brought hope back into my heart. Thank you.
%spread_zira_refugee_33%	Admittedly, it's going to feel good when they realize their mistake and try to recruit us back.
%spread_zira_refugee_34%	Not that they'll stand a chance.
%spread_zira_refugee_35%	But it's going to be healing for sure, to see them begging.
%spread_zira_refugee_38%	Although, if it goes as you say... It's going to be tough...
%spread_zira_refugee_40%	With the ghosts of our ancestors haunting us forever...
%spread_zira_refugee_41%	But still, to know that we're going to survive and thrive...
%spread_zira_refugee_46%	Greatly inspired by my talents, you will carve a temple and a statue in my name to worship my figure and nurture my powers.
%spread_zira_refugee_48%	What?
%spread_zira_refugee_49%	Are you being serious right now?
%spread_zira_refugee_50%	That's the future my cards offered, yes.
%spread_zira_refugee_51%	Is this just some elaborate method of telling us that we'll be safe as long as we serve you?
%spread_zira_refugee_52%	No! The whole thing with the cards is real! I swear!
%spread_zira_refugee_53%	...
%spread_zira_refugee_55%	Time will tell, I guess.
%spread_zira_refugee_56%	So far, any alternative is better than being hunted.
%spread_zira_refugee_61%	You will realize the heresy in your actions and will find a way to make amends with your foresisters.
%spread_zira_refugee_68%	What is this...
%spread_zira_refugee_69%	Are you in cahoots with the Jade Sculptors?
%spread_zira_refugee_70%	Trying to manipulate us back into the fold?
%spread_zira_refugee_71%	No! It's an honest interpretation of this card, I swear.
%spread_zira_refugee_73%	Have I really committed heresy, then...?
%spread_zira_refugee_74%	I'd say it's worth dedicating some thought to what your new methods really entail, at least.
%spread_zira_refugee_76%	All the sisters I dragged down with me deserve at least that, yes.
%spread_zira_refugee_77%	Thank you for your counsel.
%spread_zira_refugee_81%	So their punishment is going to work...
%spread_zira_refugee_82%	I can't really see myself thinking that what I'm doing right now is heresy.
%spread_zira_refugee_84%	But I shouldn't be blaming the oracle.
%spread_zira_refugee_88%	Hah, that is fun.
%spread_zira_refugee_89%	We're both changing our minds?
%spread_zira_refugee_90%	Am I going to realize that what I do is heresy only for them to accept my new methods?
%spread_zira_refugee_91%	Maybe there's some middle ground in all this confusion.
%spread_zira_refugee_96%	So the ghosts of our ancestors will manage to persuade us, after all...
%spread_zira_refugee_97%	It's a likely outcome, yes...
%spread_zira_refugee_101%	It can't be! Are we really walking the path of heresy?
%spread_zira_refugee_102%	But even so...
%spread_zira_refugee_104%	...What good is realizing our mistakes going to do if all of them turned to stone?
%spread_zira_refugee_105%	Ah... it's quite tragic, yes...
%spread_zira_refugee_106%	Realizing you were mistaken after all, just to find all of your sisters are gone.
%spread_zira_refugee_107%	Maybe you will start serving and worshiping their statues the same way you did with the Jade Monks, in order to make amends?
%spread_zira_refugee_108%	Oh...
%spread_zira_refugee_110%	...
%spread_zira_refugee_111%	I'm not really looking forward to that.
%spread_zira_refugee_112%	I'm sorry.
%spread_zira_refugee_114%	It's ok. Thank you for your counsel.
%spread_zira_refugee_117%	It can't be! Are we really walking the path of heresy?
%spread_zira_refugee_118%	But even so...
%spread_zira_refugee_120%	Wasn't the Arbitrage Office going to dissolve the Jade Sculptors?
%spread_zira_refugee_121%	What kind of amends are we supposed to make after that?
%spread_zira_refugee_122%	Ah... it's quite tragic, yes...
%spread_zira_refugee_123%	Realizing you were mistaken after all, just to lose your sisterhood...
%spread_zira_refugee_124%	I'm sorry.
%spread_zira_refugee_125%	...
%spread_zira_refugee_127%	Still, we're going to live.
%spread_zira_refugee_128%	That's more than I was hoping for some minutes ago, to be honest...
%spread_zira_refugee_133%	Witchhood will become unbearable for you and your sisters. You will renounce your powers and go back to live as priestesses among mortals.
%spread_zira_refugee_135%	So that's what this rebellion will boil down to, huh...
%spread_zira_refugee_137%	After this much suffering and running I don't see it as a bad ending, I guess.
%spread_zira_refugee_139%	A fulfilling mortal life is certainly preferable to immortal despair.
%spread_zira_refugee_141%	That's a wise deck.
%spread_zira_refugee_142%	I hope you find your happiness.
%spread_zira_refugee_147%	Using your art of imbuing Jade with quicksilver, you will fuse with your sisters to become a powerful entity that'll witness and survive the end of this universe.
%spread_zira_refugee_149%	...
%spread_zira_refugee_150%	Your arts pierce deep.
%spread_zira_refugee_151%	That's a possibility I've been considering since I discovered the magical merging qualities of quicksilver.
%spread_zira_refugee_153%	It'd allow us to become powerful enough to survive our pursuers, or do just about anything, really.
%spread_zira_refugee_154%	But the price is losing our individuality.
%spread_zira_refugee_155%	If your cards nudge fate in that direction, I guess I'll start working on the spell.
%spread_zira_refugee_158%	Thank you for your guidance.
%spread_zira_refugee_161%	I'm looking forward to seeing how this comes together with that prediction about them asking us to go back.
%spread_zira_refugee_162%	...Will they start worshiping us once we become a powerful entity?
%spread_zira_refugee_163%	Ha, wouldn't that be cool?
%spread_zira_refugee_164%	Honestly, I don't have a shred of sympathy left for them, but I guess we'll see.
%rival_cupressa_oracles_2%	I have a report on Cupressa's advances.
%rival_cupressa_oracles_3%	She's taken Aedana's corpse for a meeting with the oracles.
%rival_cupressa_oracles_4%	To demonstrate how they can still access Aedana's runic visions even though she's deceased.
%rival_cupressa_oracles_6%	It won many oracles over to her side. We should remind them who's the star oracle of our coven, don't you think?
%rival_cupressa_academics_2%	Cupressa's been moving.
%rival_cupressa_academics_3%	I don't know if she's calling in some favors or what, but the "old guard" has suddenly decided to support her.
%rival_cupressa_academics_5%	We should do something about it.
%rival_cupressa_supermove_2%	Ok, I have something worrying to report.
%rival_cupressa_supermove_3%	Cupressa's been shamelessly parading Aedana's corpse around to gather support.
%rival_cupressa_supermove_4%	It may be because they go back way too far, but for some reason the corpse complies with everything Cupressa says.
%rival_cupressa_supermove_11%	This is giving our sisters reason to believe in Cupressa's plan of keeping Aedana as some sort of mystic guide.
%rival_cupressa_supermove_12%	We need to do something.
%rival_jasmine_producers_2%	I have some updates regarding Jasmine.
%rival_jasmine_producers_3%	She's using the approach we expected, and is securing the demography closest to her: the producers.
%rival_jasmine_producers_5%	We could try to fight her on this, or maybe let her have the producers and try to conquer another demographic.
%rival_jasmine_producers_6%	Choose wisely.
%rival_jasmine_explorers_2%	New blow from Jasmine's party.
%rival_jasmine_explorers_3%	She must have struck some kind of deal or something, but suddenly a bunch of explorers are all about Jasmine.
%rival_jasmine_explorers_5%	Should we try to counter this?
%rival_jasmine_fearful_2%	Mmm... I have a worrisome report.
%rival_jasmine_fearful_3%	Jasmine's party has been campaigning, warning our sisters about the dangers of the Forbidden Arts.
%rival_jasmine_fearful_4%	Retelling catastrophic events of the past involving Behemoths and time-bending spells.
%rival_jasmine_fearful_5%	Many Witches are reconsidering their stance on the Forbidden Arts policy.
%rival_jasmine_fearful_18%	We shouldn't let her scare tactics spiral out of control.
%rival_jasmine_supermove_2%	Bad news regarding Jasmine...
%rival_jasmine_supermove_3%	Apparently she's been funding a group of academics to research what it'd really entail for our powers if we all devoured Aedana.
%rival_jasmine_supermove_4%	And...
%rival_jasmine_supermove_9%	Wow.
%rival_jasmine_supermove_10%	I mean, if I wasn't on your team I'd probably vote for her now.
%rival_jasmine_supermove_13%	But we mustn't give up.
%rival_jasmine_supermove_14%	Let's start the counterattack.
%rival_jasmine_supermove_17%	Even though we have the same point in our program, now we look like we wouldn't know what to do with all that power.
%rival_dahlia_explorers_2%	Dahlia's been campaigning among the explorers.
%rival_dahlia_explorers_3%	She's been painting a nice picture of how all her freedom combined with the magical tax could fund many cosmic expeditions.
%rival_dahlia_explorers_5%	Naturally, many explorers celebrated this idea.
%rival_dahlia_explorers_6%	We should be careful with this.
%rival_dahlia_warriors_2%	Well, it was only a matter of time.
%rival_dahlia_warriors_3%	Dahlia made a great speech that didn't really tackle many of the hot topics of this race but...
%rival_dahlia_warriors_5%	Warriors were super pumped and just decided to support her.
%rival_dahlia_warriors_6%	I don't really know if this is a battle we can win, to be honest.
%rival_dahlia_novi_explorers_2%	Dahlia's team has been going around promoting the wonders of spreading Aedana's remains and welcoming more Witches.
%rival_dahlia_novi_explorers_3%	The novices were especially into it.
%rival_dahlia_novi_explorers_5%	And some explorers and even some producers saw the benefits of increasing their workforce.
%rival_dahlia_novi_explorers_10%	Let's not let down our guard on this, or it may cost us the race.
%rival_dahlia_novi_explorers_13%	Even though we're running the same point in our program... I guess Dahlia's promoting it with more charisma?
%rival_dahlia_novi_explorers_14%	I'm really at a loss to why Dahlia's so successful.
%rival_dahlia_supermove_2%	Ok, I didn't see this one coming.
%rival_dahlia_supermove_3%	Dahlia and all the warriors just went on some sort of parade around the sisterhood.
%rival_dahlia_supermove_4%	It was more of a party than anything informative, but...
%rival_dahlia_supermove_5%	The energy was incredibly powerful. You know how it is with Dahlia.
%rival_dahlia_supermove_6%	She's just too good at pumping everyone up.
%rival_dahlia_supermove_13%	But we can come back from this.
%rival_dahlia_supermove_14%	Charisma is a temporary illusion. We can fight it with well-laid ideas and...
%rival_dahlia_supermove_15%	Who am I kidding? We need to be more charismatic at any cost.
%rival_dahlia_supermove_16%	Let's do our best, alright?
%rival_jasmine_novices_2%	Jasmine organized a meetup in her garden to get to know all the novices better.
%rival_jasmine_novices_3%	I don't know what transpired at that little tea party but many of them want to support Jasmine now.
%rival_jasmine_novices_5%	Let's be careful.
%rival_jasmine_academics_2%	Jasmine is going after academics now.
%rival_jasmine_academics_3%	She's outright selling fear about how our system is going to lead to chaos and the degrading of our sisterhood's well-established values.
%rival_jasmine_academics_4%	Whatever that means.
%rival_jasmine_academics_7%	The thing is that the oldest witches are buying it up.
%rival_jasmine_academics_8%	Let's stay on our toes.
%rival_dahlia_academics_2%	Dahlia's been selling her free access policy regarding the Forbidden Arts to the academics.
%rival_dahlia_academics_4%	And they're buying it.
%rival_dahlia_academics_5%	We'd better be careful about this.
%rival_dahlia_producers_2%	Bold, really bold.
%rival_dahlia_producers_3%	Dahlia's been campaigning among the producers.
%rival_dahlia_producers_5%	The impact hasn't been massive, but she's managed to cause some division among them.
%rival_dahlia_producers_6%	Stay sharp.
%con_cupressa_kickout_2%	Erm... is it true that you kicked Cupressa out of your home?
%con_cupressa_kickout_3%	Uh... yeah.
%con_cupressa_kickout_4%	She was asking us to drop out of the race.
%con_cupressa_kickout_5%	Hah!
%con_cupressa_kickout_6%	Worth losing all these votes then.
%con_cupressa_kickout_12%	She's telling everyone about your lack of diplomacy and how you're not fit to rule.
%con_cupressa_kickout_13%	But we'll overcome this.
%con_cupressa_kickout_14%	Just... try to stick to diplomacy in future meetings, please?
%con_nova_arbiter_pressure_2%	The Arbitrage Office is investigating our rivals for some reason.
%con_nova_arbiter_pressure_3%	That's affecting our sisters' trust in them.
%con_nova_arbiter_pressure_10%	Oh, yes... that was me.
%con_nova_arbiter_pressure_11%	You know what? I don't want to know.
%con_nova_arbiter_pressure_12%	Good job in any case, but be careful about... bending the law.
%con_yu_academics_2%	Fantastic news.
%con_yu_academics_3%	Yu-ënia has been meeting with academics, vouching for you.
%con_yu_academics_4%	And nepotism is powerful in our sisterhood, apparently.
%con_yu_academics_6%	Thank your mentor for me.
%con_yu_novices_2%	Fantastic news.
%con_yu_novices_3%	Yu-ënia's been meeting with the novices, counseling them in these times of change.
%con_yu_novices_4%	She vouched for you, and the novices respect her so much they're all eager to support us now.
%con_yu_novices_6%	Thank your mentor for me.
%con_arrest_junreisha_2%	Mmm...
%con_arrest_junreisha_3%	Junreisha has been arrested.
%con_arrest_junreisha_4%	Apparently she's been caught stealing the secrets of many Witches from inside and outside our coven.
%con_arrest_junreisha_5%	So the Arbitrage Office had to interfere...
%con_arrest_junreisha_12%	Since Junreisha was so clearly opposed to Dahlia, many Witches are suspecting foul play from her rivals...
%con_arrest_junreisha_14%	Even if we don't have anything to do with Junreisha's plot, the doubt has been cast.
%con_arrest_junreisha_15%	We need to focus on regaining the coven's trust.
%con_arrest_junreisha_18%	Even if they don't have anything to do with Junreisha's plot, the doubt has been cast.
%con_arrest_junreisha_19%	We can use this momentum to take the lead.
%con_junreisha_action_17%	I understand the meeting with Junreisha didn't go well, right?
%con_junreisha_action_18%	Junreisha is pulling her strings and convincing many academics to support Jasmine.
%con_junreisha_action_20%	We need to stop her. Let's get to work.
%con_junreisha_action_24%	YOU DIDN'T JUST CHANGE OUR PROGRAM.
%con_junreisha_action_25%	Ah... I'm sorry... I thought it was necessary to get Junreisha's support.
%con_junreisha_action_27%	Well... that part worked... yes.
%con_junreisha_action_28%	But now I need to rethink our strategy based on this.
%con_junreisha_action_29%	It's not exactly a minor point!
%con_junreisha_action_30%	I'm sorry!
%con_junreisha_action_31%	Ah... whatever... let's make the most of this.
%con_junreisha_action_39%	The meeting with Junreisha went well, huh?
%con_junreisha_action_41%	She got almost every academic to support us.
%con_junreisha_action_42%	What did you do?
%con_junreisha_action_46%	Ah... I kinda promised her privileged access to the Forbidden Arts.
%con_junreisha_action_47%	What...?
%con_junreisha_action_48%	Come on, Fortuna. That's so dirty.
%con_junreisha_action_49%	Let's pray word doesn't get out about it or we're going to be facing a lot of trouble.
%con_junreisha_action_50%	Sorry...
%con_junreisha_action_51%	Try to not make any more of these promises, please.
%con_junreisha_action_52%	We're not that desperate.
%con_junreisha_action_56%	Ah... nothing, really.
%con_junreisha_action_57%	Our interests just aligned.
%con_junreisha_action_58%	Really? That's fantastic.
%con_junreisha_action_59%	Let's try to keep her on our side then!
%con_junreisha_action_63%	I explained to Junreisha what my plans were once I became a god and she... liked it?
%con_junreisha_action_64%	Wait... are you planning on becoming a god?
%con_junreisha_action_65%	Well, it's a figure of speech. Once I absorb Aedana and become super powerful, I mean.
%con_junreisha_action_66%	Ok...?
%con_junreisha_action_67%	You scare me sometimes.
%con_junreisha_action_72%	Mmm... I've been keeping tabs on Junreisha since she's been known to oppose our party but...
%con_junreisha_action_73%	After her meeting with you, she's withdrawn.
%con_junreisha_action_74%	What happened?
%con_junreisha_action_76%	I kinda... blackmailed her into it.
%con_junreisha_action_77%	Come again? Are you nuts?
%con_junreisha_action_78%	If this gets out we're going to be in deep trouble.
%con_junreisha_action_79%	It won't.
%con_junreisha_action_80%	...I think.
%con_junreisha_action_81%	Ah... whatever. Good job stopping Junreisha, I guess.
%con_junreisha_action_85%	Nothing much, just a small favor.
%con_junreisha_action_86%	She's not really interested in politics, Junreisha's only after magical power.
%con_junreisha_action_87%	So I promised to share Aedana's trinket with her.
%con_junreisha_action_88%	Oh... Well, it worked.
%con_junreisha_action_89%	Let's hope our rivals don't catch wind of this and spin it to craft a story of bribery or something.
%con_junreisha_action_90%	Oops.
%con_junreisha_action_91%	It should be fine, just stay vigilant.
%con_junreisha_action_95%	Good job with Junreisha, Fortuna.
%con_junreisha_action_96%	After your meeting she started pulling her strings and convincing many academics to support Jasmine.
%con_junreisha_action_98%	Well done.
%con_junreisha_action_99%	Ah, I didn't do much, really. Junreisha just wants to eat Aedana at any cost, haha.
%con_junreisha_action_100%	Good for her.
%con_junreisha_action_104%	Did you tell Junreisha to bring the warriors to our side?
%con_junreisha_action_105%	Yeah... since they're a tough demographic I wanted to check if Junreisha could do anything about it.
%con_junreisha_action_106%	Well...
%con_junreisha_action_108%	Barely.
%con_junreisha_action_109%	What a way to waste our allies' time, Fortuna.
%con_junreisha_action_110%	I'm sorry! I had to try!
%con_junreisha_action_111%	It's ok. Let's focus on what's ahead.
%con_rangimarie_poem_3%	"$HOOK"
%con_rangimarie_poem_5%	"$LINE"
%con_rangimarie_poem_7%	"$SINKER"
%con_rangimarie_poem_8%	Wow.
%con_rangimarie_poem_9%	You're a cosmic poet now?
%con_rangimarie_poem_10%	That collaboration with Rangimarie is making every novice crazy.
%con_rangimarie_poem_12%	And it's inspiring sisters in every demographic, really.
%con_rangimarie_poem_18%	Really? I'm so happy.
%con_rangimarie_poem_19%	Great job, Fortuna.
%con_rangimarie_poem_20%	And remember:
%con_rangimarie_poem_22%	"$SINEND"
%con_rangimarie_poem_23%	Haha, shut up.
%con_rangimarie_upset_2%	Ah... Fortuna, what have you done?
%con_rangimarie_upset_3%	What now?
%con_rangimarie_upset_4%	Did you insult Rangimarie or something?
%con_rangimarie_upset_5%	She's talking shit about how you're just a shark or something.
%con_rangimarie_upset_6%	What? I just tried to get a discount for her services.
%con_rangimarie_upset_7%	Really...?
%con_rangimarie_upset_8%	Well she didn't take it well. You hurt her feelings.
%con_rangimarie_upset_10%	And no one liked that.
%con_rangimarie_upset_11%	Oops.
%con_rangimarie_upset_12%	Oops, indeed.
%con_kurielle_power_2%	What is going on? I've been having visions lately...
%con_kurielle_power_3%	And apparently the whole coven, too. About becoming more powerful.
%con_kurielle_power_4%	Now everyone is eager to devour Aedana.
%con_kurielle_power_13%	Me too, if I'm being honest...
%con_kurielle_power_14%	But we can't let Jasmine blind us and feed us the rest of her program just because Aedana's so tasty...
%con_kurielle_power_15%	Ahem.
%con_kurielle_power_16%	Sorry. Focus, Patrice.
%con_kurielle_power_17%	Let's fight this.
%con_kurielle_power_21%	That's probably Kurielle's doing.
%con_kurielle_power_22%	I read her fortune and inspired her to allow the coven to envision a future in which we can become more powerful.
%con_kurielle_power_23%	Oh, wow.
%con_kurielle_power_24%	Mass mind control.
%con_kurielle_power_25%	It's not control! It's just... propaganda?
%con_kurielle_power_26%	Sure. I'll buy it.
%con_kurielle_power_28%	Good work.
%con_kurielle_power_32%	Since you and Jasmine are both proposing to devour Aedana in your program, the votes are being split.
%con_kurielle_power_57%	A heavy blow for Dahlia and Cupressa, in any case.
%con_kurielle_welcome_2%	What is going on? I've been having visions lately...
%con_kurielle_welcome_3%	And apparently the whole coven, too. About welcoming more Witches.
%con_kurielle_welcome_4%	It's... beautiful, all that new life coming in, many new things to learn and to share...
%con_kurielle_welcome_5%	Now everyone wants to scatter Aedana's remains and have more women ascend and become Witches.
%con_kurielle_welcome_14%	Me too, if I'm being honest...
%con_kurielle_welcome_15%	But we can't let Dahlia blind us with this beautiful idea and feed us the rest of her irresponsible program...
%con_kurielle_welcome_16%	We need to focus.
%con_kurielle_welcome_17%	Let's fight this.
%con_kurielle_welcome_21%	That's probably Kurielle's doing.
%con_kurielle_welcome_22%	I read her fortune and inspired her to allow the coven to envision a future in which we welcome more sisters in.
%con_kurielle_welcome_23%	Oh, wow.
%con_kurielle_welcome_24%	Mass mind control.
%con_kurielle_welcome_25%	It's not control! It's just... propaganda?
%con_kurielle_welcome_26%	Sure. I'll buy it.
%con_kurielle_welcome_28%	Good work.
%con_kurielle_welcome_32%	Since you and Dahlia are both proposing to scatter Aedana's remains in your program, the votes are being split.
%con_kurielle_welcome_57%	A heavy blow for Jasmine and Cupressa, in any case.
%con_kurielle_utopic_2%	Sisters around the coven are reporting visions of an utopia.
%con_kurielle_utopic_3%	Now they feel that Dahlia's coven based on trust and community is the best direction for our sisterhood.
%con_kurielle_utopic_11%	I don't know when this is going to pass, but we mustn't surrender.
%con_kurielle_utopic_12%	We need to make sure that reason wins over this shallow idealism.
%con_kurielle_utopic_15%	That's probably Kurielle's doing.
%con_kurielle_utopic_16%	I read her fortune and inspired her to allow the coven to envision an ideal future.
%con_kurielle_utopic_17%	Oh, wow.
%con_kurielle_utopic_18%	Mass mind control.
%con_kurielle_utopic_19%	It's not control! It's just... propaganda?
%con_kurielle_utopic_20%	Plus it's not our fault that an ideal world looks pretty much like our program, right?
%con_kurielle_utopic_21%	Hah!
%con_kurielle_utopic_22%	You may be right. Let's enjoy this.
%con_kurielle_worst_2%	Witches around the coven are reporting visions of a catastrophe.
%con_kurielle_worst_3%	Unfortunately, many of our sisters are becoming afraid of the future and are turning toward more conservative stances.
%con_kurielle_worst_10%	They've started to fear change and are leaning towards Cupressa.
%con_kurielle_worst_11%	We need to regain their trust.
%con_kurielle_worst_12%	Let's switch gears and ease their minds.
%con_kurielle_relax_2%	Some weird spell is going around the coven making everyone feel pretty relaxed.
%con_kurielle_relax_3%	Oh, yeah, I read the cards for Kurielle and inspired her to help our sisters relax in these turbulent times.
%con_kurielle_relax_4%	Well, it's working.
%con_kurielle_relax_6%	Everyone's so relaxed that they've proposed that we postpone the deadline for the campaign by 6 cycles.
%con_kurielle_relax_7%	So everyone has the proper time to ponder each option and it gives us more time to prepare for election day.
%con_kurielle_relax_8%	Oh! Wow! Cool!
%con_kurielle_empathy_2%	Surprise.
%con_kurielle_empathy_3%	Our sisters have been putting themselves in the shoes of every candidate and they understand how stressed and tired we all are.
%con_kurielle_empathy_4%	So they decided to send a care package to every candidate to thank us for our efforts!
%con_kurielle_empathy_7%	Here's your share.
%con_kurielle_empathy_8%	Oh! So nice of them! Thank you!
%con_wunn_sabotage_2%	Something strange is going on.
%con_wunn_sabotage_5%	Cupressa's team is falling apart.
%con_wunn_sabotage_9%	Jasmine's team is falling apart.
%con_wunn_sabotage_13%	Dahlia's team is falling apart.
%con_wunn_sabotage_16%	The coven is losing faith in her abilities to run things smoothly.
%con_wunn_sabotage_17%	She's rebuilding things as we speak and will definitely counterattack.
%con_wunn_sabotage_18%	But right now things seem pretty dire for them.
%con_wunn_flee_2%	What happened with Wunn?
%con_wunn_flee_3%	I learned she's leaving the coven, and a group of academics are leaving with her.
%con_wunn_flee_6%	Uh... that's my fault.
%con_wunn_flee_7%	I couldn't communicate with her so I drew a card to see what fate had in store for us and...
%con_wunn_flee_8%	And you sent her away!? And many valued academics with her!??
%con_wunn_flee_9%	I'm sorry!! You know I don't totally control what happens with these cards.
%con_wunn_flee_10%	Ah...
%con_wunn_flee_11%	This is bad for the whole sisterhood, not just the race.
%con_wunn_flee_12%	I hope they decide to come back sometime in the future.
%con_wunn_flee_13%	Yeah...
%con_wunn_cupressa_2%	What have you done, Fortuna?
%con_wunn_cupressa_3%	Did you really scare Wunn into supporting Cupressa?
%con_wunn_cupressa_10%	They've become quite a threat to the rest of the parties now.
%con_wunn_cupressa_11%	Ah... I'm sorry. I couldn't really communicate with Wunn so I just drew a card and...
%con_wunn_cupressa_12%	Did you really write this!?
%con_wunn_cupressa_13%	You need to keep your deck in check, Fortuna.
%con_wunn_cupressa_14%	Ah... whatever, what's done is done.
%con_wunn_cupressa_15%	Let's focus on fighting back.
%con_wunn_support_2%	I don't know what you did but great job with Wunn!
%con_wunn_support_3%	She's decided to support us.
%con_wunn_support_4%	Wunn has a lot of pull within the coven so her explicitly vouching for you has caused a major shift in the vote intention.
%con_wunn_support_9%	Oh, wow!
%con_wunn_support_10%	Good job, Fortuna.
%con_zira_votes_2%	Did you welcome the Jade Sculptors' refugees into our coven?
%con_zira_votes_3%	Mmm... yeah.
%con_zira_votes_4%	That's a bit... complicated, in the middle of a race, Fortuna.
%con_zira_votes_5%	Based on the coven rules, they have the right to vote, and they're voting for us, of course.
%con_zira_votes_8%	But this didn't sit well with the rest of the coven.
%con_zira_votes_11%	Oh... I understand...
%con_zira_votes_12%	Well, I had to welcome them in, I couldn't refuse to help them.
%con_zira_votes_14%	Ah...
%con_zira_votes_15%	Ok, let's rebuild from here.
%con_zira_votes_18%	But I told them there was no need to vote for us!
%con_zira_votes_19%	Come on, you can't be that naive.
%con_zira_votes_20%	Of course they're going to vote for us! They owe you!
%con_zira_votes_21%	Yeah, but...
%con_zira_votes_22%	No buts. Our sisters have the right to be pissed.
%con_zira_votes_23%	I'm sorry...
%end_race_2%	Alright, time's up.
%end_race_3%	We did everything we could.
%end_race_6%	I know the situation looks dire, but don't let the polls intimidate you.
%end_race_8%	The whole campaign has just been to prepare for the final assembly.
%end_race_9%	Until the votes have been cast we have a fighting chance.
%end_race_12%	Right now we may not be the favorite in the polls, but this isn't over until election day.
%end_race_15%	We are the favorite in the polls, so things are looking good for us. Great job.
%end_race_16%	But let's not count our chickens yet.
%end_race_18%	In a couple of days the whole sisterhood will get together at The House of Cosmic Providence.
%end_race_19%	There, every party will get to debate our coven's future.
%end_race_20%	Not only that, but every sister also has the right to speak and will be able to express their hopes and concerns.
%end_race_21%	Pretty much anything can happen there.
%end_race_22%	Have you ever been to The House of Cosmic Providence?
%end_race_23%	Uh... I've only seen it from outside, and it's pretty intimidating.
%end_race_24%	I've been inside for some dealings, but never for an official assembly of the sisterhood.
%end_race_25%	...I'm nervous too, heh.
%end_race_26%	The thing is that inside its main hall, time holds still, so the debate can go on for hours, days or years if necessary.
%end_race_27%	Oh, no.
%end_race_28%	The rule is that no votes shall be cast until every sister has a chance to say their piece.
%end_race_29%	Then, after everything's said and done, we will all vote.
%end_race_30%	And the House of Cosmic Providence will release its hold on time so fate can unfold normally.
%end_race_31%	We've come this far, so we might as well do the whole dance.
%end_race_32%	Campaigning is now banned until the assembly, so take some time off, enjoy a bubble bath, or whatever is it you do to blow off steam.
%end_race_33%	For me it's going to be wine and sex fairies.
%end_race_34%	Patrice, again, too much information.
%end_race_35%	Shut up.
%end_race_36%	Congratulations on getting to the finish line.
%end_race_37%	Let's meet at the doors of The House of Cosmic Providence in a couple of days.
%menaka_2%	Hello, Fortuna. So nice to meet you.
%menaka_3%	Likewise.
%menaka_4%	It's an honor to meet with the Head of the Explorers.
%menaka_6%	Ah, I'm no head of anything, dear.
%menaka_7%	The rest of the explorers like to call me that, but it's just an affectionate way of calling me old.
%menaka_8%	Haha, I know many Witches hold you in great esteem, not only explorers.
%menaka_10%	Well, I mentored a lot of them, I understand the daughterly love...
%menaka_11%	But there's no such thing as a head, leader or chief of explorers.
%menaka_12%	In any case, I'm sure you have a lot of pull among them.
%menaka_13%	I won't deny that. My word carries more weight than I'd like, but that's not something I sought out.
%menaka_15%	I'd never brandish that love as a tool for command.
%menaka_17%	Anyway, enough about me.
%menaka_18%	I've always wanted to meet you! Did you know I was planning on paying you a visit right before you were exiled?
%menaka_19%	Oh, yeah?
%menaka_20%	At that time we were looking for an oracle to help us design a plan to travel inside a black hole.
%menaka_21%	Oh, whoa, I would have loved to be a part of that.
%menaka_23%	Well, unfortunately, that project was canceled after we lost a young explorer to the black hole.
%menaka_24%	The oracle that was helping us at that time told us she wasn't dead, but transported to a different era...
%menaka_25%	And that we'd probably never see her again.
%menaka_26%	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
%menaka_28%	Maybe with you on our side it would have gone differently?
%menaka_29%	We'll never know, I guess.
%menaka_31%	Look at me, talking about myself again. I'm so sorry.
%menaka_32%	Let's focus on the present or you could have me telling war stories until the end of the race.
%menaka_33%	Haha, it's quite alright.
%menaka_34%	So, you're visiting every candidate? How's that going so far?
%menaka_36%	It keeps getting harder and harder.
%menaka_38%	I'm not just visiting the candidates, but also their advisors and other team members.
%menaka_39%	And...
%menaka_41%	I just love you all too much.
%menaka_43%	The future is going to be bright, no matter who wins.
%menaka_46%	You love everyone? Even Cupressa?
%menaka_47%	The future will be brightest with us.
%menaka_48%	I agree, it's a pity we have to compete to begin with.
%menaka_52%	You love everyone? Even Cupressa?
%menaka_54%	Haha. Why of course.
%menaka_56%	She was my mentor when I ascended.
%menaka_57%	Oh, oops.
%menaka_58%	It's alright. I know how difficult Cupressa can be.
%menaka_59%	I'll even concede that she may not be the best qualified to rule, strategically speaking.
%menaka_60%	But at the same time, she is the most virtuous of us all.
%menaka_61%	I have no doubt Cupressa would always put our prosperity and well-being before anything.
%menaka_62%	Not that Dahlia, Jasmine, or whoever is the next leader wouldn't, but...
%menaka_63%	We human Witches tend to be a bit more unpredictable than the rest.
%menaka_64%	I understand.
%menaka_68%	The future will be brightest with us.
%menaka_70%	Haha. Switched to campaign mode, I see.
%menaka_71%	I mean it.
%menaka_72%	I'm sure you do.
%menaka_74%	You all adamantly believe that.
%menaka_75%	That's why I'm not worried at all.
%menaka_76%	My vote will be egotistical, as will the vote of all of our sisters, I'm sure.
%menaka_77%	Personally, since I know there's no wrong option, I am going to vote for whoever brings the coven closer to the interests of the explorers.
%menaka_81%	I agree, it's a pity we have to compete to begin with.
%menaka_83%	I know... It must be hard on you.
%menaka_84%	You, Jasmine and Dahlia are pretty close, right?
%menaka_85%	My true family, I'd say.
%menaka_87%	I hope this race makes you even closer after the dust settles.
%menaka_88%	Yeah, me too.
%menaka_89%	I wish I could have enjoyed some quiet time with my loved ones before getting thrown back into Witch society this hard.
%menaka_91%	We rarely choose our struggles.
%menaka_93%	Why don't you stay out of it if the race is this hard on you?
%menaka_94%	I should have, shouldn't I?
%menaka_95%	But I guess I do care about the fate of this coven.
%menaka_96%	That's why I have to make sure it's our program we move forward with.
%menaka_98%	Ah... the clash of friendship and conviction.
%menaka_102%	So, tell me, is there a way to count on your support?
%menaka_103%	Hah, so blunt.
%menaka_104%	That's a good sign.
%menaka_105%	It's not that there's something specific you can do to get my vote.
%menaka_106%	But yours is the only party with an oracle in it. I'm curious about that.
%menaka_107%	So, if it's not rude to ask, I would like to experience your divination.
%menaka_108%	Specifically, how it may benefit the everlasting task of charting this universe.
%menaka_109%	What did you have in mind?
%menaka_110%	A simple request.
%menaka_111%	Tell me about somewhere I haven't been.
%menaka_112%	Heh, not so simple, considering you're famous for having been everywhere.
%menaka_113%	Everywhere known, at least.
%menaka_114%	(I guess there's no harm in writing up a place for Menaka to find.)
%menaka_115%	(Should I overdo it and impress her? Or should I stick to her request?)
%menaka_118%	(Let's totally overdo this.)
%menaka_119%	(Nah... I'll play it safe.)
%menaka_128%	Very well, I accept your challenge.
%spread_menaka_intro_3%	Haha, it's not a challenge, my dear.
%spread_menaka_intro_4%	Ahem...
%spread_menaka_intro_6%	Well, you're right, it is a challenge, fair enough.
%spread_menaka_intro_8%	You know, Menaka, it'd be a huge honor to count on your support.
%spread_menaka_intro_10%	So I'm not only going to tell you about a place you haven't been...
%spread_menaka_intro_12%	I'm going to tell you about what you'll find there.
%spread_menaka_intro_13%	Oh, bold.
%spread_menaka_intro_16%	It's alright, I can deliver.
%spread_menaka_intro_17%	Let's ask my deck for somewhere you haven't been.
%spread_menaka_intro_20%	Ok, I'm starting to get excited.
%spread_menaka_intro_21%	Hold tight to that excitement while I shuffle my deck.
%spread_menaka_intro_22%	And connect with what you felt the first time you visited an uncharted place.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_6%	There's a naturally formed icosahedron the size of Everest in orbit around Jupiter, between its fifth and sixth moon.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_8%	That's impossible.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_9%	Only one way to find out.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_11%	Earth's solar system has been mapped ad nauseam.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_12%	I'm not going to find anything among the moons of any planet there.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_13%	As I said. Only one way to find out.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_15%	...
%spread_menaka_somewhere_17%	Very well, I'll revisit our boring old solar system once more, just for you.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_18%	I hope it's worth my time.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_19%	I'm sure it will be.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_21%	...And a "naturally formed icosahedron" to top it off, haha.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_23%	I'll believe it when I see it.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_28%	Trace the light between the two largest stars of our galaxy and you will find an undiscovered moon that lost its planet half a million years ago.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_30%	Mmm... are you sure?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_31%	Our galaxy is pretty well mapped.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_32%	I mean, yeah, there's the chance we've overlooked a wandering moon but...
%spread_menaka_somewhere_34%	I am 100% sure that you will find it.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_37%	Very well.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_38%	I'll bet on your divination.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_43%	Adrift inside the Horsehead nebula, you will find the skull of a massive Behemoth, the size of the Moon Stone Temple.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_44%	Mmm... How recent is it?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_45%	I doubt we would have overlooked something so prominent.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_46%	I don't know, but I am certain you'll find it there should you explore the Horsehead nebula once more.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_47%	It's a risky bet. Are you sure you want me to go all the way there?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_52%	Travel a light-year below my house, and you'll discover a planet whose atmosphere is immune to light.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_54%	Haha, come again?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_55%	There's a planet immune to light under my asteroid home.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_57%	First of all, there's no "under" when it comes to navigating space. But sure, I'll take it.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_58%	But then, what does "immune to light" even mean?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_60%	Are you sure you're not just improvising some cheap sci-fi nonsense?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_61%	Haha, when you put it like that, it does sound ridiculous.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_62%	I don't know what being immune to light means, but I'm sure that if you follow my directions you will find just that.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_64%	Fortuna, this is not a game to me. Are you sure you want me to travel one light-year below your home right now?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_65%	Yes.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_70%	Close to the black hole you last studied you missed the remnants of a planet once mined by the Quarry Titans.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_71%	...Are you sure?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_72%	We charted that area pretty exhaustively.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_73%	Maybe the high stakes of it all made you overlook the husk of a mined planet.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_75%	It's not... impossible.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_76%	I can go sweep the area once more.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_77%	Are you certain it'll be worth my time?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_82%	Observe the surface of VY Canis Majoris carefully. There, you'll find a wormhole that can be crossed safely without getting burnt. It'll take you to an undiscovered location.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_83%	Oh.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_84%	Wow.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_85%	That is pretty...
%spread_menaka_somewhere_87%	Far-fetched.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_88%	Is it possible, though?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_89%	Well... It's not impossible.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_90%	Then you will find it.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_92%	Are you sure you want to send your elder into one of the largest known stars?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_93%	Hahahaha.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_94%	Yes.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_95%	I mean, it sounds funny.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_96%	But I'm 100% sure. You are going to find that wormhole and you will be able to go through it safely.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_110%	And I will find the sister we lost to the black hole... there?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_111%	It doesn't make any sense.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_112%	I just hope... you're right.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_113%	Everything is going to be alright.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_115%	Thank you, dear.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_119%	So I just need to find the place, feel some sort of inspiration and start meditating, right?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_120%	You'll know what to do.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_121%	Very well, looking forward to hearing that mystic melody.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_124%	I'm supposed to find a star the size of an apple.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_125%	That'd be weird enough on its own... but to find it there?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_126%	If you're right you're going to have a life-long believer.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_127%	Haha, sounds nice.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_130%	I'll be on the lookout for that strange mineral.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_131%	Can't wait to blow the mind of every smith around the universe.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_132%	The excitement is real.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_135%	And I'm supposed to find a telepathic octopus made of dark matter there?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_136%	This is some sort of elaborate prank, right?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_137%	Hahahaha.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_138%	No, no, all legit, I swear.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_139%	Alright...
%spread_menaka_somewhere_142%	And you say you can predict what I'll discover there?
%spread_menaka_somewhere_143%	This goes beyond any kind of precognition I've ever witnessed before.
%spread_menaka_somewhere_144%	Let's draw another card and see!
%spread_menaka_discovery_6%	Do a thorough search, for there you will find the sister you lost to the black hole.
%spread_menaka_discovery_8%	What...? Is that... true?
%spread_menaka_discovery_9%	Don't give hope to these old bones.
%spread_menaka_discovery_10%	This is real.
%spread_menaka_discovery_11%	I want to believe you more than anything, but...
%spread_menaka_discovery_12%	We did everything in our power back then and there wasn't a way to get her back.
%spread_menaka_discovery_13%	It's going to work.
%spread_menaka_discovery_14%	Trust me.
%spread_menaka_discovery_15%	...
%spread_menaka_discovery_17%	Ok.
%spread_menaka_discovery_19%	Thank you.
%spread_menaka_discovery_24%	This new place will invite you into meditation. There you will hear the echo of a long lost melody that will expand the breadth of your arts.
%spread_menaka_discovery_25%	Wow, I'm in for an experience, then?
%spread_menaka_discovery_26%	Looks like it! Now I'm jealous!
%spread_menaka_discovery_27%	Haha, if this place really exists I'll share what I learn with you.
%spread_menaka_discovery_28%	Deal.
%spread_menaka_discovery_33%	You will find an anomalous star, the size of an apple, but it'll hold as much power as the Sun.
%spread_menaka_discovery_34%	Hahaha. Oh, dear.
%spread_menaka_discovery_35%	...
%spread_menaka_discovery_37%	Wait, you're being serious.
%spread_menaka_discovery_38%	I am. My divination is never wrong.
%spread_menaka_discovery_39%	If I really find a star the size of an apple, "anomalous" is going to fall short as a description.
%spread_menaka_discovery_40%	I'm looking forward to hearing all about it.
%spread_menaka_discovery_42%	Very well. I shall look for it.
%spread_menaka_discovery_47%	In this new place, you will find an undiscovered mineral that will be coveted by many Witch smiths.
%spread_menaka_discovery_48%	Oh! Exciting!
%spread_menaka_discovery_49%	Discovering something that propels magical society in new directions is one of the biggest honors and pleasures for an explorer.
%spread_menaka_discovery_50%	Enjoy it, then!
%spread_menaka_discovery_51%	I will!
%spread_menaka_discovery_56%	You will meet with a telepathic octopus made of dark matter. It will teach you to forgive yourself.
%spread_menaka_discovery_57%	Oh! Then we'll join a band of golden dolphins to dance around a rainbow!
%spread_menaka_discovery_58%	What?
%spread_menaka_discovery_59%	Oh, I thought we were getting creative.
%spread_menaka_discovery_60%	Hahahaha.
%spread_menaka_discovery_61%	No, this will really happen.
%spread_menaka_discovery_63%	Come on. That can't be real!
%spread_menaka_discovery_64%	You more than anyone should know that the cosmos is full of surprises!
%spread_menaka_discovery_66%	Oh, my. You're completely serious.
%spread_menaka_discovery_67%	Yes!
%spread_menaka_discovery_68%	Now I'm curious... and a bit scared.
%spread_menaka_discovery_73%	Ok, where do I need to go, then?
%spread_menaka_discovery_74%	Let's draw another card.
%spread_menaka_followup_2%	What you just did... it's something else.
%spread_menaka_followup_4%	I'm leaving immediately to explore.
%spread_menaka_followup_5%	Can't wait to hear back from you!
%spread_menaka_followup_6%	You can bet you will.
%spread_menaka_followup_8%	Thank you so much for indulging me.
%menaka_2_2%	Ok. You are the real deal.
%menaka_2_3%	You must forgive me for all my condescension.
%menaka_2_9%	There it was, smiting all of my preconceived ideas: the icosahedron, floating placidly among the moons of Jupiter.
%menaka_2_10%	And you were right, upon closer inspection there was no doubt it was naturally formed.
%menaka_2_11%	It taught me how little I still know about this cosmos, and how much left I have to explore and... re-explore.
%menaka_2_12%	It made me feel...
%menaka_2_14%	Young.
%menaka_2_18%	There it was, timidly spinning, alone in the void its mother planet left.
%menaka_2_19%	Too small and insignificant to be charted or named.
%menaka_2_20%	But a new place nonetheless.
%menaka_2_21%	I called it Fortuna, in your honor.
%menaka_2_24%	There it was, waiting to be found, overlooked by the ego of so many explorers who wouldn't deign to explore anywhere that has already been named.
%menaka_2_25%	The skull of a Behemoth.
%menaka_2_26%	Big enough to hold a whole coven inside.
%menaka_2_27%	There's so much power to be learned and drawn from it.
%menaka_2_30%	A planet immune to light. Impossible to discover in the vastness of this cosmos.
%menaka_2_31%	We'll send a team there after the elections, but... I touched it, I stood on it. It's there, even if it can't be seen.
%menaka_2_32%	It's not like a black hole, where light can't escape its pull.
%menaka_2_33%	Photons can't interact with it. They just go straight through, like glass, but its surface was harder and denser than the Earth.
%menaka_2_36%	The remnants of a Titan Quarry were there. The distant black hole slowly pulls on its pieces, disintegrating it further.
%menaka_2_37%	Its molten core is no more, sapped by the Titans.
%menaka_2_38%	The only thing left is a fragmented husk, robbed of everything useful, but...
%menaka_2_39%	There's a twisted beauty in contemplating the bare bones of a celestial body.
%menaka_2_42%	I dared to cross the wormhole, buried among the imposing flames of the giant star.
%menaka_2_43%	It took me to a non-euclidian labyrinth, made of what looked like quartz and jasper.
%menaka_2_44%	If it's the work of a sentient being, it's not any we've encountered so far.
%menaka_2_45%	A Behemoth, maybe? The thing is that any spell I cast was absorbed towards its insides.
%menaka_2_46%	When the race is over we should put together a task force to properly map it.
%menaka_2_47%	The place is hypnotic, enthralling, even for the most seasoned eyes.
%menaka_2_57%	And... you were right.
%menaka_2_58%	When I was about to leave, our lost sister put her hand on my shoulder.
%menaka_2_59%	I don't understand how she ended up there.
%menaka_2_60%	Her mind was lost, but she still recognized me.
%menaka_2_61%	We can't age, so it's difficult to say how long she's been stranded there.
%menaka_2_62%	But her clothes... were almost disintegrating.
%menaka_2_63%	I took her back to the explorer's guild, we'll do our best to heal her mind.
%menaka_2_64%	Thank you so much for helping me find her.
%menaka_2_65%	It was an open wound I've had for far too long. Poor Witch...
%menaka_2_68%	And yes, it called out to me, a soft hum at the beginning.
%menaka_2_69%	I had to sit, alone, in that untrodden corner of the cosmos, and meditate.
%menaka_2_70%	Soon the melody became clear, part lost memory, part influx of some arcane gods.
%menaka_2_71%	I'm still analyzing its tantalizing structure, but it's filling me with inspiration.
%menaka_2_72%	I may do something I've never done before.
%menaka_2_74%	I'm going to write a book.
%menaka_2_75%	Haha, wow. What a trip.
%menaka_2_78%	Ultimately, my attention was captured by a bonfire that burned more intensely than the hottest forge.
%menaka_2_79%	Only, it wasn't a bonfire. My heart was easy, I wasn't robbed of the pleasure of being the first one there.
%menaka_2_80%	It was indeed a star, the size of an apple, burning away with the strength of a sun.
%menaka_2_81%	My eyes couldn't believe it. Such an anomalous imbalance between space and energy might change magic as we know it.
%menaka_2_84%	Since you forewarned me about it, I took a sample with me and checked its composition.
%menaka_2_85%	It's unlike anything we've seen before. You were right.
%menaka_2_86%	We just discovered a new element.
%menaka_2_89%	I was about to leave, to claim my--our--discovery, and the most alien words sprouted in my mind. But they weren't my thoughts.
%menaka_2_90%	Impossible to witness without Witch eyes, and without losing some of your sanity, there it was:
%menaka_2_91%	An octopus made of dark matter, projecting thoughts into my mind.
%menaka_2_92%	It spoke the Tongue of the Nebula, and its words were like fractal poems.
%menaka_2_93%	You were right...
%menaka_2_95%	It managed to soothe my inner Daemons.
%menaka_2_97%	I thanked the creature and left.
%menaka_2_98%	Wow. I wish I could have gone with you.
%menaka_2_101%	You are incredible, Fortuna.
%menaka_2_102%	I've never witnessed such a display of power.
%menaka_2_103%	Thank you.
%menaka_2_104%	I've worked with other oracles in the past to aid in our expeditions, but this...
%menaka_2_105%	This is something else.
%menaka_2_106%	See, centuries ago I built a special orrery that continuously sweeps our charted space and mutates to depict any changes in our universe...
%menaka_2_107%	...down to the precision of an asteroid: your cute little house does indeed appear there.
%menaka_2_108%	So, what the evidence points towards so far is either that the orrery is malfunctioning, or that the place you sent me to didn't exist before our meeting.
%menaka_2_110%	...Are we sure that what you're doing is divination?
%menaka_2_113%	(Confess the true nature of your powers.)
%menaka_2_114%	(Play dumb.)
%menaka_2_118%	Your instincts are right.
%menaka_2_119%	I discovered recently that what I do with my cards is not divination.
%menaka_2_120%	I'm bending reality.
%menaka_2_122%	Oh, my, the implications of that...
%menaka_2_123%	Yes, I've been mulling them over and over.
%menaka_2_124%	The question now is...
%menaka_2_126%	Should I fear or follow someone like you?
%menaka_2_129%	You should definitely respect me.
%menaka_2_130%	Follow me and I'll take care of all of you.
%menaka_2_131%	Neither, we can just be friends.
%menaka_2_135%	You should definitely respect me.
%menaka_2_138%	You say that, but...
%menaka_2_140%	You don't inspire a single speck of intimidation.
%menaka_2_141%	I can't bring myself to fear or have that kind of respect for you.
%menaka_2_143%	Which may be your strongest suit, making everyone lower their guard around you.
%menaka_2_146%	Yes. Excuse me. You're right.
%menaka_2_147%	We are lucky to count you among our allies.
%menaka_2_148%	I'm only sorry we didn't discover your talents sooner.
%menaka_2_152%	Follow me and I'll take care of all of you.
%menaka_2_155%	You say that, but...
%menaka_2_157%	You don't really have the presence of a leader.
%menaka_2_158%	You may be a great counselor, the best ally one could dream of, but...
%menaka_2_160%	It's not exactly you who I'd follow.
%menaka_2_163%	Yes. Excuse me. You're right.
%menaka_2_165%	There's an animal instinct in me yelling that it wouldn't be wise to go against you.
%menaka_2_167%	But you would never act against your sisters... right?
%menaka_2_168%	It's unlikely, yes.
%menaka_2_170%	Then this must just be a primal reaction to having encountered a power so far beyond my expectations.
%menaka_2_173%	Yes! Finally a leader I can blindly trust.
%menaka_2_175%	Pity it's not you who's running for leader. But I'd follow any party you're in without hesitation.
%menaka_2_177%	You're making me feel an excitement I haven't experienced since I was a novice.
%menaka_2_181%	Neither, we can just be friends.
%menaka_2_185%	Haha, that would be for the best, yes.
%menaka_2_186%	You must be struggling with so many responsibilities on your shoulders, poor thing.
%menaka_2_188%	Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on you, ok?
%menaka_2_189%	Thank you...
%menaka_2_192%	Well... of course, if that's what you want.
%menaka_2_194%	I can't help but fear there's something more to all of this.
%menaka_2_197%	Haha, absolutely!
%menaka_2_198%	Sometimes things are simpler than we think.
%menaka_2_199%	I would love to be considered your friend.
%menaka_2_200%	Likewise!
%menaka_2_204%	What else would we call it?
%menaka_2_205%	I shuffle my cards, I interpret them, and, yes, uncannily, I am always right.
%menaka_2_206%	Maybe we should invent a word for being this precise and clear through divination...
%menaka_2_207%	Futuremancer or something like that?
%menaka_2_208%	Hmm...
%menaka_2_209%	I can't help but feel there's something more to it.
%menaka_2_211%	Where you sent me... and what I found...
%menaka_2_213%	But sure, I respect it if you don't want to show me all your cards, of course.
%menaka_2_217%	But... that's impossible, of course.
%menaka_2_218%	(Phew... I'm glad I played it safe with her request.)
%menaka_2_220%	Mmm...
%menaka_2_221%	I'd like to further test these capabilities of yours, if you don't mind.
%menaka_2_222%	I'm going to have to start charging you, Menaka.
%menaka_2_223%	Haha, this time it's something pretty straightforward.
%menaka_2_225%	Do you know what this is?
%menaka_2_227%	No... some sort of puzzle box?
%menaka_2_228%	It's what was left of Archwitch Kedamia when her coven scattered her remains.
%menaka_2_229%	Her sisters aren't around anymore, but they trusted Cupressa with this contraption, and Cupressa trusted me with solving its mystery...
%menaka_2_230%	This is... ancient, even by Witch standards.
%menaka_2_233%	Yes.
%menaka_2_234%	It's what was left of Archwitch Kedamia when her coven scattered her remains.
%menaka_2_235%	This contraption has been around in our coven for a long time, and in all those millennia there's been little progress with solving its mystery.
%menaka_2_236%	Oh, I'm impressed. Not many are aware of the existence of Kedamia's artifact.
%menaka_2_238%	And you would like me to open it? As a test?
%menaka_2_239%	Oh, no, that would be an unfair demand.
%menaka_2_240%	We've been stumped by it for ages now.
%menaka_2_241%	I'd like to find a clue as to what it is, using your... divination.
%menaka_2_244%	And what do I get in exchange?
%menaka_2_245%	Very well, let's take a look at it.
%menaka_2_246%	(POWER) Gimme. I'll open that for you.
%menaka_2_250%	And what do I get in exchange?
%menaka_2_252%	True... I'm abusing your hospitality at this point, right?
%menaka_2_254%	I'm beyond impressed by your capabilities. My vote will go to your party, for sure.
%menaka_2_255%	But, if you help us with this... I'll do everything in my power to get as many sisters as I can to support your cause.
%menaka_2_256%	Not because I'd owe you, but because you and your team would be the right choice.
%menaka_2_258%	So, will you help me, please?
%menaka_2_261%	I'll help you if we win this race.
%menaka_2_262%	Very well, let's take a look at it.
%menaka_2_263%	(POWER) Gimme. I'll open that for you.
%menaka_2_269%	I'll help you if we win this race.
%menaka_2_271%	It's going to be like that, huh...
%menaka_2_272%	We need this victory.
%menaka_2_274%	Very well. I'm not so proud as to let the chance of finally unraveling Kedamia's secret slip by me.
%menaka_2_275%	I'll do anything it takes.
%menaka_2_276%	So I'll rally my sisters in your support.
%menaka_2_277%	See you in congress.
%menaka_2_278%	Thank you for your support, Menaka.
%menaka_2_279%	Good luck.
%menaka_2_285%	Gimme. I'll open that for you.
%menaka_2_287%	Ah... But this artifact has eluded our--
%menaka_2_288%	It's alright. I can handle it.
%menaka_2_289%	Here.
%menaka_2_292%	Bu-but... This is impossible!
%menaka_2_294%	How could you possibly?
%menaka_2_295%	Look, there's some writing inside, no?
%menaka_2_296%	This is... The Tongue of the Nebula, right?
%menaka_2_297%	I need to take this to Wunn immediately.
%menaka_2_298%	As for you...
%menaka_2_300%	You need to rise to power, Fortuna.
%menaka_2_301%	Lead us.
%menaka_2_306%	I don't care if it's under Dahlia's banner.
%menaka_2_309%	I don't care if it's under Jasmine's banner.
%menaka_2_311%	I will support you with everything I have.
%menaka_2_312%	I'll rally our sisters to your cause.
%menaka_2_313%	Thank you!!!
%menaka_2_314%	Now, I need to dissect Kedamia's message.
%menaka_2_315%	This is exciting! Finally some progress!
%menaka_2_316%	Keep me posted!
%menaka_2_317%	Will do. Thanks for everything!
%menaka_2_322%	Very well, let's take a look at it.
%spread_menaka_artifact_intro_2%	I'm going to ask my deck to put you on the path that'll untangle this mystery.
%spread_menaka_artifact_intro_3%	Yes please.
%spread_menaka_artifact_intro_4%	Let's take a look at this artifact's future.
%spread_menaka_artifact_intro_6%	Focus on everything you've learned about it.
%spread_menaka_artifact_intro_7%	On the countless hours you've spent studying it.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_6%	You will require the aid of the highest ranking Arbiter. She has classified information that'll allow you to finally unlock Kedamia's artifact.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_7%	Oh, I would never have expected that angle.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_8%	I'm not a big fan of the Witch police, but I'll take it.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_13%	Only a Behemoth can open it. You'll need to form a pact with one of them to discover what's inside the artifact.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_15%	Oh, no... Forbidden magic.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_21%	...And your program plans to keep these arts forbidden.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_22%	You're putting me in a tough spot, Fortuna...
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_23%	Oh, oops... You're right.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_24%	Well, you can always form a pact in secrecy...?
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_26%	Let's ignore that suggestion and move on.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_28%	I'll handle it.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_32%	Pretty convenient that your party plans to give free access to these arts, huh?
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_34%	Oh, I wasn't thinking about that! It's just a coincidence.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_35%	Absolutely, my dear.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_37%	It works for me.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_41%	Pretty convenient that your party plans to extend permits to access the Forbidden Arts, huh?
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_46%	Study the songbooks of the Deerfolk. Commit to their culture and soon enough you will be magically inspired as to how to unravel this mystery.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_47%	Uh... That sounds pretty time consuming.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_48%	It's gonna keep me from exploring for a long time.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_50%	I could even think you're sending me on a fool's errand.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_51%	I would never.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_53%	I know, I know. I'm sure it'll be fun.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_54%	Familiarizing yourself with another culture is another form of exploration.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_59%	The artifact can only be opened by the reincarnation of Archwitch Kedamia. She still hasn't been born, but you will recognize her once you meet her.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_61%	Oh... So it's a waiting game, then.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_63%	Well, there's some kind of freedom in knowing you can't do anything more.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_65%	It'll free up a lot of space in my mind, that's for sure.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_70%	You need to pierce through Kedamia's entelechy. A witch named Louise can weave you a key to peel off the protective layers.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_71%	Oh, Louise?
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_72%	You know her?
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_73%	Yes. She trained to be an explorer back when she was a novice, but it didn't work out.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_75%	She was too... absorbed, by that entelechy thing.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_76%	Was more interested in the substance of things than in the actual exploration.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_77%	Louise is one of the kindest souls I've ever known. I would have loved to have her with us.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_82%	I heard she recently moved to live on Earth with her lover, right?
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_83%	That's right, yeah.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_84%	My, my... It's been eons since I visited Earth.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_85%	I'll go pay her a visit.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_89%	She recently had to flee the coven to avoid Aedana's punishment, right?
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_90%	Poor Louise, if only she had waited for a few weeks, Aedana would have stopped being her problem.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_92%	We need to invite her back.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_96%	Happy to hear we'll work together again!
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_100%	And having experienced your talents firsthand... This must be it.
%spread_menaka_artifact_clue_101%	Finally, some progress in Kedamia's mystery!
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_2%	Thank you so much, Fortuna.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_4%	You surpassed every expectation I had.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_6%	Even more than that, you made me fall in love with immortality again.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_8%	Before meeting you, I was disillusioned with this cosmos already. I felt like I had seen it all.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_10%	And you tore through all that like a supernova, not only showing me new places but magic beyond my comprehension.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_11%	I'm so happy to hear that.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_13%	You have my full support.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_14%	I'll vouch for you in front of our sisters.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_15%	I'm looking forward to the future of this coven with you at the helm.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_20%	Well, you and Dahlia, of course.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_23%	Well, you and Jasmine, of course.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_25%	Thank you so much.
%spread_menaka_artifact_followup_26%	See you in congress, good luck with the race!
%con_menaka_support_2%	You made a great impression on Menaka.
%con_menaka_support_3%	She is vouching for us, swaying most of the explorers to our side.
%con_menaka_support_6%	Menaka is wonderful, I had a great time with her.
%con_menaka_support_7%	That's good. Good energy for the race. Keep it up.
%con_menaka_impressed_2%	What happened with Menaka!?
%con_menaka_impressed_3%	Have you seen the numbers!?
%con_menaka_impressed_10%	You blew her mind with your magic!
%con_menaka_impressed_11%	She's urging everyone to vote for us with unprecedented fervor.
%con_menaka_impressed_12%	Hahaha, wow, that's great!
%con_menaka_impressed_13%	Seriously, what did you do?
%con_menaka_impressed_14%	Just solved Kedamia's artifact.
%con_menaka_impressed_15%	What!?? The coven's been working at that for centuries, Fortuna!
%con_menaka_impressed_16%	What can I say, I've got talent.
%con_menaka_impressed_17%	You don't make any sense.
%con_menaka_impressed_18%	That's good. Let's keep this momentum.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_2%	Hey, Fortuna, I came up with a little strat. Want to hear about it?
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_5%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_6%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_10%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_13%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_14%	Excuuuse me?
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_15%	Really rude. Come on, hear me out:
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_17%	I've got some dirt on Jasmine from... the days you were exiled.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_18%	I was thinking of taking it to the Arbitrage Office. It's nothing big enough to get her arrested or anything.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_19%	But triggering an investigation will damper Jasmine's image. What do you think?
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_22%	Very cunning. Let's do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_23%	We shouldn't play dirty. I'd rather not.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_27%	Very cunning. Let's do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_28%	Alright! I'll head out right away then!
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_34%	We shouldn't play dirty. I'd rather not.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_35%	Mmm... I get your point, but... Look, this race is not getting any easier.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_36%	I'm going to do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_37%	Uh... ok.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_38%	(I guess I didn't have a saying since I wrote Dahlia would do this back when she consulted me about the race...)
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_39%	Trust me, it'll be good.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_con_2%	It's done.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_con_3%	Not my proudest moment, but it worked. The Arbiters are investigating Jasmine... quite publicly.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_con_10%	Now let's make use of this... sacrifice, and try to stay ahead.
%sp_race_dahlia_arbiter_con_11%	We got this, Fortuna.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_2%	Hey, Fortuna, I came up with a little strat. Want to hear about it?
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_5%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_6%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_10%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_13%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_14%	Excuuuse me?
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_15%	Really rude. Come on, hear me out:
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_17%	I'm going to extend an open duel to the whole coven!
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_18%	I'll welcome just anyone to face me, to prove before everyone I'm the strongest Witch in our sisterhood!
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_19%	I'm confident I can beat just anyone in a one-to-one duel. That'll for sure boost our ratings, right!?
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_22%	So bold! Let's do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_23%	That's too risky... I'd rather not.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_27%	So bold! Let's do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_28%	Alright! I'll head out right away then!
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_34%	That's too risky... I'd rather not.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_35%	Mmm... I get your point, but... Look, this race is not getting any easier.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_36%	I'm going to do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_37%	Uh... ok.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_38%	(I guess I didn't have a saying since I wrote Dahlia would do this back when she consulted me about the race...)
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_39%	Trust me, it'll be good.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_con_2%	HAHA! I KNEW IT!
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_con_3%	Not a single Witch dared to accept my duel.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_con_10%	We're golden. I just established myself as the strongest Witch in our sisterhood.
%sp_race_dahlia_duel_con_11%	Let's use this momentum to keep on garnering support.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_2%	Hey, Fortuna, I came up with a little strat. Want to hear about it?
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_5%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_6%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_10%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_13%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_14%	Excuuuse me?
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_15%	Really rude. Come on, hear me out:
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_17%	I know if this Daemon I deal with from time to time... After failing to kill them for the umpteenth time, we kinda started talking.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_18%	And... I believe I could strike a deal with them.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_19%	Make the Daemon infiltrate our sisters' nightmares to show them how ugly it could get under Jasmine od Cupressas's management. What do you say?
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_22%	That's twisted, but... Yes. Let's do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_23%	We shouldn't play dirty. I'd rather not.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_27%	That's twisted, but... Yes. Let's do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_28%	Alright! I'll head out right away then!
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_34%	We shouldn't play dirty. I'd rather not.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_35%	Mmm... I get your point, but... Look, this race is not getting any easier.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_36%	I'm going to do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_37%	Uh... ok.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_38%	(I guess I didn't have a saying since I wrote Dahlia would do this back when she consulted me about the race...)
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_39%	Trust me, it'll be good.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_con_2%	It's done...
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_con_3%	Not my proudest moment, but it's already working. Our sisters are getting visions of how wrong it could be under Jasmine or Cupressa's rule.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_con_10%	The Daemon arts should be untraceable so... We're good.
%sp_race_dahlia_daemon_con_11%	Let's keep our grit now and make it to the finish line.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_2%	Hey, Fortuna, I came up with a little strat. Want to hear about it?
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_5%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_6%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_10%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_13%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_14%	Excuuuse me?
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_15%	Really rude. Come on, hear me out:
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_17%	I want to inspire our younger sisters to fight harder for our future!
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_18%	I'm not talking just about the novices, I'm aiming to rally the youngest among every demographic!
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_19%	The plan is to organize a demonstration to demand a more equitable sisterhood! What do you say!?
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_22%	Fantastic idea! Let's do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_23%	I don't think the timing's right...
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_27%	Fantastic idea! Let's do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_28%	Alright! I'll head out right away then!
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_34%	I don't think the timing's right...
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_35%	Mmm... I think I get your point, but... Look, this race is not getting any easier.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_36%	I'm going to do it.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_37%	Uh... ok.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_38%	(I guess I didn't have a saying since I wrote Dahlia would do this back when she consulted me about the race...)
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_39%	Trust me, it'll be good.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_con_2%	IT WAS FANTASTIC! WHAT A RUSH!
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_con_9%	I wish you were there, Fortuna.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_con_10%	All the young Witches are really looking forward to a more horizontal coven. The rally was glorious.
%sp_race_dahlia_rally_con_11%	We got this! Keep up the good work!
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_2%	Fortuna... I need to talk to you.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_3%	I... I'm not sure I'm cut out for this.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_4%	The race is getting too intense... Is this how it's going to feel to lead our sisters?
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_5%	I don't know if I'm strong enough.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_6%	Maybe I should drop out of the race...
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_7%	What!? No! What's going on?
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_8%	I... I need some time to gather my thoughts.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_9%	Can you hold the fort for me while I'm gone?
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_10%	(Shit... I caused this, it's what I read back when Jasmine consulted me about the race.)
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_11%	("You will lose faith in yourself and your leadership will resent from it.")
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_12%	Fuck me.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_13%	Come again?
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_14%	Nothing. Please. Yes. Take your time.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_15%	We got this, I'll cover for you.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_16%	But hey, what we're doing here is something good.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_17%	I want you back and strong, alright?
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_18%	...
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_19%	See you soon.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_20%	Thanks.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_con_2%	I'm back...
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_con_3%	...And?
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_con_4%	I'm ready to fight.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_con_5%	I'm sorry I put you all on the spot.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_con_6%	I'm better now. Let's win this.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_con_7%	Glad to have you back.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_con_8%	You can do this, Jasmine.
%sp_race_jasmine_confidence_con_9%	Yes. Time to work.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_2%	Hey, Fortuna, I cooked up a little plan. Want to hear about it?
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_5%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_6%	Not really. Let's focus on what works.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_10%	Of course. Tell me.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_13%	Not really. Let's stick to the plan.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_14%	Wow! Rude!
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_15%	Hear me out, at least:
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_17%	There's this really old academic Witch who's been one of our bigger supporters since the race began.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_18%	But... There's a detail about her past that's been eating at me... I know for a fact that she once broke the Magical Pact.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_19%	I believe we should report her to the Arbiters. That'll be a huge statement about how serious and incorruptible we are. What do you think?
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_22%	It's harsh, but it's a good move. Let's do it.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_23%	Uh... I don't think she deserves that.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_27%	It's harsh, but it's a good move. Let's do it.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_28%	Very well. I got this. I'll be back.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_34%	Uh... I don't think she deserves that.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_35%	Come on, Fortuna. We can't falter at this point.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_36%	I'm going to do it.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_37%	Uh... ok.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_38%	(I guess I didn't have a saying since I wrote Jasmine would do this back when she consulted me about the race...)
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_39%	Trust me. I got this. I'll be back.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_con_2%	It's done.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_con_3%	The Arbiter Office has made the arrest...
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_con_10%	As I expected, this caused the rest of the elders to respect us more, and we even managed to impress some of the youngest.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_con_11%	It's... This has been a necessary sacrifice. A matter of principle, even.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_con_12%	Better not let this sacrifice go to waste now.
%sp_race_jasmine_betray_con_13%	Back to work.
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_2%	Fortuna! It's happening! The crisis you predicted!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_5%	What's going on!?
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_6%	Not right now, Jasmine. I'm busy.
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_10%	What's going on!?
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_13%	Not right now, Jasmine. I'm busy.
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_14%	What? Shut up! This is important:
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_16%	An unexpected and pretty aggressive plague is eating away our sisters' gardens and orchards!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_17%	But I can fix it! I know exactly how!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_18%	It's as if this problem was especially made by the cosmos for me to fix it!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_19%	Again, you were right on the money with your fortune-telling!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_20%	Haha... Yeah.
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_21%	I'm off right now! time for Jasmine to save the day!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_22%	I leave you in charge while I'm gone!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_23%	Oh, ok!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_24%	Good luck!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_con_2%	Everything's good now! I saved everyone's harvests!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_con_3%	I'M A HERO!
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_con_9%	Thanks to your fortune telling there wasn't a single doubt in my heart.
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_con_10%	I knew I was meant to do this and I did it.
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_con_11%	I'll be forever thankful, Fortuna.
%sp_race_jasmine_crisis_con_12%	Now... The race is not over yet! Let's keep up the good work!
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_3%	Lucky break:
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_5%	For some reason an arbiter has become obsessed with Dahlia and is scrutinizing every move she makes.
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_6%	...I doubt she'll find anything troublesome for Dahlia, but...
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_27%	It doesn't look pretty for one of the candidates to have the Arbitrage Office on her tail.
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_29%	Oh, whoa, I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_30%	Oh... Good job?
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_31%	I didn't know I was "writing" when I did this reading for Dahlia... but it works for us I guess.
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_32%	Dahlia's support will wane until the air clears out. Let's make the most out of this opportunity.
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_36%	We're fucked.
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_37%	What happened!?
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_40%	Oh, shit... This is my fault. I made this happen with my cards back when Dahlia consulted me about the race.
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_41%	Fantastic.
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_42%	Dahlia's support will wane until the air clears out...
%con_sp_dahlia_arbiter_43%	But we've got nothing to hide, so let's press on and look for opportunities to make Dahlia look good.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_3%	Interesting...
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_5%	For some reason, the oldest Witches are after Dahlia's neck.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_6%	They've been whispering on the ears of the most influential Witches in every group.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_7%	And practically every demographic except for the warriors are losing trust in Dahlia's ability to lead.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_28%	This is something hard to shake off.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_30%	Oh, whoa, I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_31%	Oh... Good job?
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_32%	I didn't know I was "writing" when I did this reading for Dahlia... but it works for us I guess.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_33%	Dahlia's support will wane until she proves the elders whispers' to be unfounded. Let's make the most out of this opportunity.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_37%	We're fucked.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_38%	What happened!?
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_41%	Oh, shit... This is my fault. I made this happen with my cards back when Dahlia consulted me about the race.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_42%	Fantastic.
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_43%	Dahlia's support will wane until she proves the elders whispers' to be unfounded...
%con_sp_dahlia_elders_44%	But we've got nothing to hide, so let's press on and look for opportunities to rebuild Dahlia's image.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_2%	Mmm... Dahlia's playing dirty.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_3%	This wasn't on my calculations.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_4%	What happened?
%con_sp_dahlia_report_5%	This is not like Dahlia, but... she's been feeding info to the Arbitrage Office.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_12%	They're closely investigating all the candidates... I doubt they'll find something grave, but it's going to affect our image.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_13%	Vote intention is switching towards Dahlia because of this play.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_14%	Uh... I think I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_15%	Back when Dahlia consulted me about the race.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_16%	Oh... fuck. That explains things, though.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_17%	Don't worry, there is nothing much we can do about it.
%con_sp_dahlia_report_18%	Let's focus on earning back the trust from our sisters now.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_2%	Oh shit, Dahlia. The balls on this Witch.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_3%	What happened?
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_4%	She extended an official duel, before the whole coven. To prove she's the strongest.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_5%	Oh, no.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_6%	She said she'll take on just anyone.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_7%	And the worst part is that...
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_8%	No one dared to face her. Not even the elders. So her little bravado played out.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_15%	Vote intention is switching towards Dahlia because of this.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_16%	Uh... I think I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_17%	Back when Dahlia consulted me about the race.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_18%	Oh... fuck. That explains things, then.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_19%	Don't worry, there is nothing much we can do about it.
%con_sp_dahlia_duel_20%	Let's focus on earning back the trust from our sisters now.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_2%	Uh... This is dark.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_3%	What happened?
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_4%	I would have never expected it from Dahlia, but, apparently, she made a pact with a Daemon to sabotage her opponent's efforts.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_5%	Oh, wow. What does it imply?
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_6%	Nothing illegal, that's the worst part.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_7%	The Daemon is visiting the weakest witches in their nightmares...
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_8%	Showing them how a dire future we could have should someone other than Dahlia become leader.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_15%	And how's that not illegal!? That's not fair!
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_16%	Well, using your powers to ascend isn't forbidden in our coven... magical selection.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_17%	Urgh... Well, it makes me feel a bit less dirty for using my cards.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_18%	And... oh, shit.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_19%	What?
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_20%	I'm the one who wrote this! When Dahlia consulted me I wrote she'd make this pact with a Daemon!
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_21%	Hah, then it's just sweet karma. Nice.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_22%	I'm sorry...
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_23%	Don't worry, there is nothing much we can do about it.
%con_sp_dahlia_daemon_24%	Let's focus on earning back the trust from our sisters now.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_2%	Uh, uh... We need to watch out for Dahlia.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_3%	Why?
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_4%	She's been working the youngest Witches, with unprecedented success.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_5%	I'm not talking just about the novices, Dahlia's been touring giving inspirational speeches to the youngest among every demographic.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_6%	She rallied them all to demonstrate for a more equitable sisterhood.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_7%	And it's working...
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_14%	Vote intention is switching towards Dahlia because of this.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_15%	Uh... I think I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_16%	Back when Dahlia consulted me about the race, I read about how the best move for her would be to rally the youngest.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_17%	Oh... fuck. That explains things, then.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_18%	Don't worry. There is nothing much we can do about it now.
%con_sp_dahlia_rally_19%	Let's focus on earning back the trust from our sisters.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_3%	We're in luck!
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_5%	I don't know what happened, but one of the elders just had it with Jasmine and decided to withdraw her endorsement to Jasmine's party.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_6%	It's made quite some waves among the producers and academics.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_29%	Jasmine's going to have to work hard to earn their trust back.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_31%	Oh, whoa, I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_32%	Oh... Good job?
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_33%	I didn't know I was "writing" when I did this reading for Jasmine... but it works for us I guess.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_34%	Support for Jasmine will wane until the air clears out. Let's make the most out of this opportunity.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_38%	I bring bad news.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_39%	What happened!?
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_42%	Oh, shit... This is my fault. I made this happen with my cards back when Jasmine consulted me about the race.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_43%	Fantastic.
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_44%	Support for Jasmine will wane until the air clears out...
%con_sp_jasmine_switch_45%	But let's not falter, we'll look for opportunities to restore the respect for Jasmine.
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_2%	Mmm... Something unexpected happened.
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_3%	Apparently Jasmine broke down during a speech.
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_4%	Rumors say she's losing trust in herself. Her team is worried about her.
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_5%	Oh, oh...
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_6%	What?
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_7%	I made this happen with my cards back when Jasmine consulted me about the race.
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_8%	Oof, well played.
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_9%	Not that I'm proud about it, but it works in our favor, I guess.
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_31%	No time for mercy in this race. Let's press on and keep stealing votes from Jasmine.
%con_sp_jasmine_confidence_32%	We got this.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_3%	Something weird is going on... That is working in our favor.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_5%	I don't know who started the rumor, but word is that Jasmine's responsible for Aedana's death to begin with.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_6%	They're saying that Jasmine talked her into becoming a corpse after manipulating her with some psychedelic mixtures.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_7%	That's complete bullshit, of course. But... the rumor is out there, so it's going to be hard to shake off.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_30%	Jasmine's going to have to work hard to earn their trust back.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_32%	Oh, whoa... I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_33%	Oh... Good job?
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_34%	I didn't know I was "writing" when I read she would be blamed for a tragedy during the race... but it works for us I guess.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_35%	Support for Jasmine will wane until the air clears out. Let's make the most out of this opportunity.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_39%	Fuck me a hundred times. Shit.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_40%	What's going on!?
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_43%	Oh, shit... This is my fault. I made this happen with my cards back when Jasmine consulted me about the race.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_44%	Fantastic...
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_45%	Support for Jasmine will wane until the air clears out...
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_46%	But let's not falter, we'll look for opportunities to restore the respect for Jasmine.
%con_sp_jasmine_blamed_48%	Back to work.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_2%	Wow. Jasmine is ruthless, Fortuna.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_3%	Why? What happened?
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_4%	She's sold out one of the elders to the Arbitrage Office.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_5%	The wild thing is that it was one of her biggest supporters.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_6%	I didn't catch all the details, but it seems this Witch broke the Magical Pact a long time ago.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_7%	Something you would think to forgive, since it was ages ago, but not Jasmine.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_8%	The most shocking part is that this caused the rest of the elders to respect her, and even impressed some of the youngest.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_15%	Vote intention is switching towards Jasmine because of this.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_16%	Uh... I think I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_17%	Back when Jasmine consulted me about the race, I read about how she would gain many votes should she choose to betray someone close to her.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_18%	Oh... fuck. That explains things, then.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_19%	I can't believe she did it.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_20%	What did you expect, you put that elder on a silver platter for Jasmine.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_21%	Ah... maybe.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_22%	Anyway, we need to fight this.
%con_sp_jasmine_betray_23%	Let's regain the trust of the coven.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_3%	Bad news.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_5%	The Arbitrage Office went and released a... "analysis" of the race.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_6%	The report states that Jasmine's party is the best suited to guarantee a peaceful existence.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_13%	Not that peace is the only thing we're after as a sisterhood, but being endorsed by the Arbitrage Office is a huge thing.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_14%	Uh... I think I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_15%	Back when Jasmine consulted me about the race, I read about how the Arbitrage Office would support her cause.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_17%	Oh... fuck.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_18%	I'm sorry.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_19%	It's ok. Nothing we can do about it now.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_20%	Let's focus on earning back the trust from our sisters.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_21%	Back to work.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_24%	Incredible news.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_27%	Oh, yeah? Very nice, Fortuna.
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_28%	I did it unknowingly but... I guess it works for us!
%con_sp_jasmine_endorsement_29%	You bet. Let's make the most out of this momentum.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_3%	Mmm... Unexpected problem. I didn't see this one coming.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_5%	The elders have been meeting with the novices to guide them in these "confusing" times.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_6%	They've been telling them all about the history of the coven and how Aedana guided us out of some dark times that came before her.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_7%	And they're tying this nice tale up explaining how Jasmine's program is the best suited to ensure the continuity of this golden era.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_13%	As a consequence, Jasmine's sweeping the votes from all novices and then a bit more.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_14%	Oh, ok... I made this happen with my cards.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_15%	Back when Jasmine consulted me about the race, I read about how the elders would influence the novices to support her.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_17%	Oh... I see. Fuck.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_18%	I'm sorry.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_19%	It's ok. Nothing we can do about it now.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_20%	Let's focus on earning back the trust from our sisters.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_21%	Back to work.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_24%	Unexpected development. Don't worry, it's good!
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_27%	Oh, yeah? Very nice, Fortuna.
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_28%	I did it unknowingly but... I guess it works for us!
%con_sp_jasmine_elders_help_29%	You bet. Let's make the most out of this momentum.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_2%	Well... Isn't this just convenient? Something's off...
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_3%	What happened?
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_4%	Out of thin air, a plague has been hitting hard all of the producers' gardens and orchards.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_5%	And, guess who had the solution for this unexpected crisis?
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_6%	Jasmine?
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_7%	Jasmine.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_8%	It smells fishy. Too convenient.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_14%	The thing is that, of course, Jasmine saving the day has garnered her support from most of the producers and them some more.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_15%	Oh... I know what happened.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_16%	It's my fault, I made it happen with my cards.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_17%	Back when Jasmine consulted me about the race, I read about how she would solve a major crisis with her flower magic during the race.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_18%	Oh... fuck. That explains things, then.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_19%	I'm sorry...
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_20%	It's alright, you weren't aware about what you were actually doing back then.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_21%	Let's focus on finding opportunities to flex our skills in front of the coven now.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_22%	Jasmine's not the only formidable candidate in this race.
%con_sp_jasmine_flowers_23%	Back to work.
%garden_intro_2%	Come on! This one is super easy!
%garden_intro_3%	Ah... what is she doing?
%garden_intro_4%	Some clue, maybe?
%garden_intro_5%	This character is legendary! They're known for never giving up!
%garden_intro_6%	Alright... I think you're...
%garden_intro_9%	Batman?
%garden_intro_10%	James Bond?
%garden_intro_11%	Wile E. Coyote?
%garden_intro_15%	What? No! Who's that!?
%garden_intro_16%	I KNOW!
%garden_intro_17%	I KNOW, I KNOW!
%garden_intro_18%	What's the name of that famous earthling...
%garden_intro_19%	AH, YES.
%garden_intro_20%	LADY GAGA!!
%garden_intro_21%	What?? Hahahahah.
%garden_intro_22%	Lady Gaga!??
%garden_intro_23%	Who's that?
%garden_intro_24%	A pop star from the 2100s, I think?
%garden_intro_25%	I don't know, she's the only historical figure I know from Earth.
%garden_intro_26%	Ok, we're from completely different worlds and eras, this wasn't a good idea.
%garden_intro_27%	But Fortuna, you should know this character!
%garden_intro_28%	Tell me already, there's no way I can guess it.
%garden_intro_29%	Ahab!
%garden_intro_30%	Ahab?
%garden_intro_31%	Yes! From Moby Dick!
%garden_intro_32%	Look at me! With the harpoon and everything!
%garden_intro_33%	That's impossible! I didn't even know what the main character of Moby Dick was called!
%garden_intro_34%	No??
%garden_intro_35%	Bah...
%garden_intro_37%	Forget it.
%garden_intro_38%	The Magic Brownie should be ready to eat, anyway.
%garden_intro_39%	Up for some tea and some smiles?
%garden_intro_40%	Alright!
%garden_intro_41%	I'm ready, ma'm.
%garden_brownie_2%	Oof, you shouldn't make them so delicious. I always end up having one too many.
%garden_brownie_3%	And they pair with the tea so well...
%garden_brownie_4%	I'm going to want a literal ton to take out later.
%garden_brownie_5%	Haha, I figured as much. I already prepared a survival kit for you.
%garden_brownie_6%	I'll help you carry it to your asteroid later.
%garden_brownie_7%	Much appreciated.
%garden_brownie_8%	Hey, Fortuna.
%garden_brownie_9%	How come you never got a familiar?
%garden_brownie_10%	It's so lame every time you write to just get... like, an envelope with a message.
%garden_brownie_11%	One of the best parts of Witch correspondence is getting to pet each others' familiars!
%garden_brownie_12%	I've always wanted to bring that up too, yes.
%garden_brownie_13%	Ah... I don't know.
%garden_brownie_14%	I have serious trouble with commitment.
%garden_brownie_15%	Like, that's a living being, and I'd need to think about feeding them and taking care of them...
%garden_brownie_16%	But now that you're going to be exiled for a millennium, wouldn't it be good to keep you company?
%garden_brownie_17%	...
%garden_brownie_18%	Eh... We don't need to talk about this if you don't want to.
%garden_brownie_19%	No, it's alright.
%garden_brownie_20%	I guess I wouldn't want to keep any sentient being imprisoned with me just so that I don't feel alone.
%garden_brownie_21%	Fair point... You've always been so empathetic...
%garden_brownie_22%	Ah, I don't think empathy is what's going on here.
%garden_brownie_23%	I'd say it's the opposite. How egotistical and self-centered I am.
%garden_brownie_24%	Hey, hey, where's that coming from?
%garden_brownie_25%	I'm not looking for pity. I accepted it so long ago, don't worry.
%garden_brownie_26%	Fortuna...
%garden_brownie_27%	Hey, I know.
%garden_brownie_28%	If you HAD to get a familiar, what would you like it to be?
%garden_brownie_31%	Definitely a cat.
%garden_brownie_32%	A super intelligent crow!
%garden_brownie_33%	I'd like it eerie, like a sentient eye.
%garden_brownie_34%	Something weird, like a chocolate golem.
%garden_brownie_38%	Definitely a cat.
%garden_brownie_39%	Classic.
%garden_brownie_40%	What kind of cat?
%garden_brownie_41%	Any. All cats are beautiful.
%garden_brownie_42%	Yeah, but come on, you must have one in mind.
%garden_brownie_43%	Probably a Maine Coon. Big and fluffy.
%garden_brownie_44%	Ooooh! Now I want you to have a familiar!
%garden_brownie_45%	Hahaha, when I'm out of exile I might consider it.
%garden_brownie_46%	Yay!
%garden_brownie_50%	A super intelligent crow!
%garden_brownie_51%	Oh! I never would have guessed!
%garden_brownie_52%	Why super intelligent, though?
%garden_brownie_53%	Because all crows are super intelligent, duh.
%garden_brownie_54%	Hahaha.
%garden_brownie_55%	I imagine its wings with eye patterns, like a moth's wings.
%garden_brownie_56%	Oooh, that's super cool!
%garden_brownie_57%	Whoa, I'm totally seeing it, yeah.
%garden_brownie_58%	Where am I going to find a specimen like that?
%garden_brownie_59%	I'll keep an eye out, in case I can get you one for when you come out of exile!
%garden_brownie_60%	I feel bad capturing something so beautiful, though.
%garden_brownie_61%	But I'll look for a familiar when I'm free, I promise.
%garden_brownie_62%	Cool.
%garden_brownie_66%	I'd like it eerie, like a sentient eye.
%garden_brownie_67%	No! I object!
%garden_brownie_68%	What? Why?
%garden_brownie_69%	How are we supposed to pet an eye!?
%garden_brownie_70%	You're missing the whole point of this conversation, Fortuna!
%garden_brownie_71%	But I thought...
%garden_brownie_72%	I'm with Jasmine here, Fortuna.
%garden_brownie_73%	Under no circumstances are you to get a fucking creepy eye as a familiar.
%garden_brownie_74%	Ok, I give up.
%garden_brownie_75%	Just pick up whatever you want to pet and I'll look after it.
%garden_brownie_76%	Wise choice.
%garden_brownie_77%	Hahaha.
%garden_brownie_81%	Something weird, like a chocolate golem.
%garden_brownie_82%	Haha, what?
%garden_brownie_83%	Did I overdo it with the herbs in the brownie?
%garden_brownie_84%	Hahaha, I'm serious.
%garden_brownie_85%	You could pet it if you want, then lick your fingers afterwards.
%garden_brownie_86%	What are you saying? Why the hell would you want an edible familiar?
%garden_brownie_87%	Aren't most of them edible, though?
%garden_brownie_88%	NO!!
%garden_brownie_89%	Not in that way, at least!
%garden_brownie_90%	I'm just gonna say that I wouldn't mind having a chocolate surprise in my window from time to time.
%garden_brownie_91%	Dahlia!
%garden_brownie_92%	Hahahaha.
%garden_brownie_93%	It's settled. When I'm out of exile I'll craft a chocolate golem.
%garden_brownie_94%	Seriously...
%garden_brownie_98%	Friends, my brownies are kicking in.
%garden_brownie_99%	And they're making me feel like...
%garden_brownie_100%	Philosophy.
%garden_brownie_101%	Oh, no.
%garden_brownie_102%	Oh, yes. Here we go.
%garden_brownie_103%	Haha. Listen.
%garden_brownie_104%	Have you ever considered why men can't become Witches?
%garden_brownie_107%	Because men have too much privilege.
%garden_brownie_108%	It's because of our superior emotional intelligence.
%garden_brownie_109%	Maybe it's a biological thing?
%garden_brownie_110%	Because the cosmos is unfair.
%garden_brownie_114%	Because men have too much privilege.
%garden_brownie_115%	Hear hear.
%garden_brownie_116%	Nah, it's not that.
%garden_brownie_117%	My planet is matriarchal, but not a single man has ascended to become a Witch.
%garden_brownie_121%	It's because of our superior emotional intelligence.
%garden_brownie_122%	Hear hear.
%garden_brownie_123%	Wait.
%garden_brownie_124%	What's that?
%garden_brownie_125%	Haha, my sister explained it to me.
%garden_brownie_126%	It's like... being smart but for feelings?
%garden_brownie_127%	Huh...?
%garden_brownie_128%	They invented it on Earth a few decades after I became a Witch.
%garden_brownie_129%	It's like... listening to yourself, and being empathetic, and... being able to properly communicate...
%garden_brownie_130%	I think.
%garden_brownie_131%	And women have more of that than men?
%garden_brownie_132%	I don't know. I was just being mean for no reason.
%garden_brownie_136%	Maybe it's a biological thing?
%garden_brownie_137%	Like... our periods?
%garden_brownie_138%	It's not that at all.
%garden_brownie_139%	I know women that don't bleed.
%garden_brownie_140%	Oh, of course, trans women and nonbinary people can ascend.
%garden_brownie_141%	We have several in our coven, so the biological theory goes out of the window.
%garden_brownie_145%	Because the cosmos is unfair.
%garden_brownie_146%	Birds fly and fish can live underwater.
%garden_brownie_147%	That's just the state of reality.
%garden_brownie_148%	Mmm... but we know that birds fly and fish can breathe in water because evolution took them there through natural selection.
%garden_brownie_149%	There's no explanation as to why women and nonbinary people--no matter if they're human, deerfolk or any other species--are the only ones able to ascend.
%garden_brownie_150%	Oh... touché.
%garden_brownie_154%	It's because men are the fucking worst, then.
%garden_brownie_155%	Jeez, I will never understand how men got to be so awful on your home planet.
%garden_brownie_156%	Jasmine comes from the nineteenth century. From what I know that was fucking nightmarish.
%garden_brownie_157%	Women didn't even have the right to vote.
%garden_brownie_158%	Hah, and that was just a symptom of how much they saw us as inferior.
%garden_brownie_159%	You sure you don't want us to invade your planet and institute a matriarchy?
%garden_brownie_160%	Let's do it.
%garden_brownie_161%	No!
%garden_brownie_162%	We're on a path, in human society.
%garden_brownie_163%	Well, they're on a path.
%garden_brownie_164%	It's not our fight anymore.
%garden_brownie_165%	Slowly but surely, women are turning it around.
%garden_brownie_166%	My offer still stands if you ever want it less slowly and more surely.
%garden_brownie_167%	Oh, yeah, nice...
%garden_brownie_168%	Reaaaaally nice.
%garden_brownie_169%	Pfft... are you high, Jasmine?
%garden_brownie_170%	Yup, aren't you?
%garden_brownie_171%	...
%garden_brownie_172%	Yes.
%garden_brownie_173%	Let's dance.
%garden_dance_2%	Ooh!
%garden_dance_3%	Jasmine!? Have you been learning new moves??
%garden_dance_4%	YES.
%garden_dance_5%	Hahahaha.
%garden_dance_6%	Woohoo!!
%garden_dance_7%	Should we put some music on?
%garden_dance_8%	HAHAHA.
%garden_dance_9%	There's music already, the plants are singing!
%garden_dance_10%	Oh!
%garden_dance_11%	...
%garden_dance_12%	Sure!
%garden_dance_13%	Hahahaha.
%garden_dance_14%	Hahahaha.
%garden_dance_15%	...
%garden_dance_17%	I'm going to miss you so much...
%garden_dance_19%	Awww...
%garden_dance_20%	Fortuna...
%garden_dance_22%	I love you.
%garden_dance_23%	I love you too.
%garden_dance_24%	...I love you so much.
%garden_dance_25%	Hang in there, Forty.
%garden_dance_26%	What did you just call me?
%abramar_finally_alone_2%	Ah... Finally alone.
%abramar_finally_alone_3%	Yeah, it's been too much having so many people in here all of a sudden.
%abramar_finally_alone_4%	Yes.
%abramar_finally_alone_5%	Plus I missed you.
%abramar_finally_alone_6%	You missed me? I never left!
%abramar_finally_alone_7%	I missed talking to you. Just the two of us.
%abramar_finally_alone_10%	Aw, I missed you too.
%abramar_finally_alone_11%	Come on, don't be so clingy.
%abramar_finally_alone_12%	You're such a softie.
%abramar_finally_alone_16%	Aw, I missed you too.
%abramar_finally_alone_19%	Come on, don't be so clingy.
%abramar_finally_alone_22%	You are such a softie.
%abramar_finally_alone_24%	I don't want to be toxic and hoard you all for myself or anything...
%abramar_finally_alone_25%	But I was so jealous of all those Witches visiting you while I had to remain hidden.
%abramar_finally_alone_26%	Ok. What's going on? Why are you getting this cloying?
%abramar_finally_alone_28%	...
%abramar_finally_alone_29%	The end is near.
%abramar_finally_alone_30%	What end?
%abramar_finally_alone_31%	You will soon hate me.
%abramar_finally_alone_32%	Why? What are you going to do?
%abramar_finally_alone_34%	Activate the Fire seal.
%abramar_finally_alone_38%	And I will have to reap the life of the one you love the most.
%abramar_finally_alone_40%	Ah... Will it be...?
%abramar_finally_alone_41%	I won't say. You'll find out soon enough.
%abramar_finally_alone_43%	Patrice... I'm so sorry.
%abramar_finally_alone_44%	You chose your own price.
%abramar_finally_alone_47%	And I will have to absorb your immortality.
%abramar_finally_alone_48%	You'll need to go back to the mortal world, and we won't get to see each other again.
%abramar_finally_alone_51%	You swore to sacrifice your whole coven.
%abramar_finally_alone_52%	This whole race may have been pointless to begin with.
%abramar_finally_alone_54%	True. I knew the moment to pay would come, sooner or later.
%abramar_finally_alone_57%	I intend to pay. I won't hate you.
%abramar_finally_alone_58%	You're right... I will hate you.
%abramar_finally_alone_59%	There's no way around this?
%abramar_finally_alone_63%	I intend to pay. I won't hate you.
%abramar_finally_alone_64%	Heh...
%abramar_finally_alone_65%	We'll see about that.
%abramar_finally_alone_66%	I've been through this too many times.
%abramar_finally_alone_70%	You're right... I will hate you.
%abramar_finally_alone_71%	It's how it always goes. I end up despised or betrayed.
%abramar_finally_alone_73%	It's only natural to want to rebel against the one who's taking something precious from you.
%abramar_finally_alone_74%	I...
%abramar_finally_alone_75%	I don't think I will ever hate you, though. No matter how much you loathe me.
%abramar_finally_alone_76%	You really are special, Fortuna.
%abramar_finally_alone_77%	I will treasure our time together, no matter what happens.
%abramar_finally_alone_81%	There's no way around this?
%abramar_finally_alone_82%	No.
%abramar_finally_alone_83%	I can't evade my responsibility.
%abramar_finally_alone_84%	Can't I resist you in any way?
%abramar_finally_alone_86%	You could always try to destroy me.
%abramar_finally_alone_88%	But right now you're not at a level where you can dispel me.
%abramar_finally_alone_89%	You can't get rid of me. Not even with your deck.
%abramar_finally_alone_92%	What if I ask the whole coven to stop you?
%abramar_finally_alone_93%	What happens if you decide to spare me?
%abramar_finally_alone_94%	Ok... I'll pay.
%abramar_finally_alone_98%	What if I ask the whole coven to stop you?
%abramar_finally_alone_100%	You would go that far!?
%abramar_finally_alone_101%	Just... exploring my options.
%abramar_finally_alone_102%	I'm not sure your coven is currently powerful enough to defeat me.
%abramar_finally_alone_103%	Even if you make it, you will take severe losses.
%abramar_finally_alone_105%	Plus, wouldn't it defeat the purpose of regaining your freedom?
%abramar_finally_alone_106%	They'd see Aedana was right and that you should remain exiled and deprived of your powers.
%abramar_finally_alone_108%	They may even erase you.
%abramar_finally_alone_109%	That's true...
%abramar_finally_alone_113%	What happens if you decide to spare me?
%abramar_finally_alone_114%	I will never do that. It goes against my nature, my purpose, my entelechy.
%abramar_finally_alone_115%	The Cosmic Wheel would erase me from every universe since I wouldn't be Ábramar anymore.
%abramar_finally_alone_116%	My energy would be repurposed into something new.
%abramar_finally_alone_117%	Don't you feel like being born anew?
%abramar_finally_alone_119%	No.
%abramar_finally_alone_120%	I am Ábramar.
%abramar_finally_alone_121%	I want to be Ábramar.
%abramar_finally_alone_122%	Ok, ok...
%abramar_finally_alone_124%	Don't even joke about that.
%abramar_finally_alone_128%	Ok... I'll pay.
%abramar_finally_alone_130%	Please. You need to pay.
%abramar_finally_alone_131%	I understand... I'm sorry.
%abramar_finally_alone_135%	I'm happy I met you, despite everything.
%abramar_finally_alone_137%	Hate me or not, you're getting what you wanted.
%abramar_finally_alone_138%	Tomorrow you will leave this asteroid at last. How are you feeling?
%abramar_finally_alone_141%	Scared. I'm not sure if I'm ready.
%abramar_finally_alone_142%	Excited to return to society at last.
%abramar_finally_alone_143%	I feel... sad?
%abramar_finally_alone_147%	Scared. I'm not sure if I'm ready.
%abramar_finally_alone_148%	200 years inside these walls... I'm afraid that the world I miss isn't going to be out there anymore.
%abramar_finally_alone_149%	Everything will be different. I'm coming to terms with the fact that there's no way of getting back what I lost, really.
%abramar_finally_alone_151%	My only hope is to gather enough strength to build a life I can enjoy from this point onwards.
%abramar_finally_alone_155%	Excited to return to society at last.
%abramar_finally_alone_156%	I'm not one for crowds, I've never been super sociable, but...
%abramar_finally_alone_157%	After so much time isolated I feel like I'm about to rebound towards the other extreme.
%abramar_finally_alone_158%	I want to make friends, I want to hug strangers... I don't know.
%abramar_finally_alone_159%	I need to... FEEL other people.
%abramar_finally_alone_160%	It'll probably pass in a couple of weeks of disappointment and then I'll be back to my usual self, haha.
%abramar_finally_alone_164%	I feel... sad?
%abramar_finally_alone_165%	Oh?
%abramar_finally_alone_166%	It doesn't make any sense, I know.
%abramar_finally_alone_167%	All this time I've been longing for freedom, and when I'm about to reach it, I feel...
%abramar_finally_alone_168%	Sad?
%abramar_finally_alone_169%	Haven't you ever felt sad after achieving something it took you so much to accomplish?
%abramar_finally_alone_170%	Sorry. Can't relate. We Behemoths don't "achieve," we just make things happen.
%abramar_finally_alone_171%	Of course you do.
%abramar_finally_alone_172%	I don't know, Ábramar.
%abramar_finally_alone_176%	Whatever the case, I sincerely hope you enjoy the rest of your existence to the fullest.
%abramar_finally_alone_177%	Thank you.
%abramar_finally_alone_178%	And speaking of enjoying ourselves...
%abramar_finally_alone_179%	This is probably our last night together on this asteroid.
%abramar_finally_alone_180%	You're not coming back to this life, so make all the cards you want, enjoy some books, lay in bed...
%abramar_finally_alone_181%	And when you're ready, let me know and I'll let you ride my back to the House of Cosmic Providence.
%abramar_finally_alone_182%	What! I'm getting to ride you like a cosmic shrimp?
%abramar_finally_alone_184%	What?
%abramar_finally_alone_186%	Hahahaha! You didn't just call me a shrimp.
%abramar_finally_alone_187%	Sorry. I've been thinking about it since the moment I first saw you.
%abramar_finally_alone_189%	I've heard "lobster" before. But shrimp??
%abramar_finally_alone_191%	Come on, show some respect.
%abramar_finally_alone_192%	Hahaha.
%abramar_finally_alone_193%	Sorry, sorry, oh, magnificent lobster.
%abramar_finally_alone_194%	Shut the fuck up.
%abramar_finally_alone_195%	Take your time, and then I'll fly you to congress.
%abramar_finally_alone_196%	Aye aye.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_2%	Are you nervous?
%abramar_travel_to_congress_3%	Yes.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_4%	Why?
%abramar_travel_to_congress_5%	I'm about to meet dozens of Witches all at once.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_6%	Do you care about what others think of you?
%abramar_travel_to_congress_7%	Yes.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_8%	Don't you?
%abramar_travel_to_congress_9%	I'd like to say that I don't care about what anyone thinks about me.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_10%	And after having lived through many universes it's mostly true, but...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_11%	From time to time I find someone that I do care about what they think.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_12%	Are you talking about me?
%abramar_travel_to_congress_13%	Yes.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_14%	In fact, I was listening in when you were talking with Yu-ënia about me.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_15%	Of course you were.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_19%	"I don't know. The Behemoth is just a tool to me."
%abramar_travel_to_congress_20%	Mean.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_21%	Really mean.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_22%	Well, I...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_23%	Haha, don't worry. I know you were just trying to look strong in front of your mentor.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_24%	Sometimes we say stuff that we don't really mean.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_25%	It happens to me too.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_26%	...Too often, I'd say.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_27%	Yeah, you can be a piece of shit sometimes.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_28%	Hahahaha.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_29%	See, you love me. Otherwise you wouldn't get so worked up over what a "tool" has to say.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_30%	Shut up.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_34%	"I like him very much... I owe him my life."
%abramar_travel_to_congress_35%	Oh, I wish I had lacrimal glands to tear up.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_36%	Shut up.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_37%	Haha, I'm sorry. But I'm being serious...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_38%	Hearing you say that made me so happy that it made me wish I could cry.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_39%	Ábramar...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_43%	"I don't really trust him."
%abramar_travel_to_congress_44%	Ouch.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_45%	After everything I've done for you.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_46%	Well, you're mostly to blame for that, my man.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_47%	I'm the one hurt here and on top of that it's my fault, just wonderful.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_48%	I mean, have you seen yourself smile?
%abramar_travel_to_congress_49%	Plus you're always going on, like...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_50%	"Ooooh, the consequences, oooh, you don't know what you're getting yourself into."
%abramar_travel_to_congress_51%	HAHAHA.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_52%	Do I sound like that?
%abramar_travel_to_congress_53%	Well, no. You sound meaner and scarier.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_54%	Hahaha, ok, ok. It may be my fault a little bit.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_55%	...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_56%	I'm sorry.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_57%	I would like you to trust me.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_58%	I would like to trust you too...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_59%	I really like you.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_60%	Me too, Fortuna.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_64%	"I both hate him and love him."
%abramar_travel_to_congress_65%	If I had blood I'd still be blushing, miss.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_66%	Shut up, dude.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_67%	And then Yu-ënia was all like...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_68%	"Those are the best ones, aren't they?"
%abramar_travel_to_congress_69%	This is so embarrassing...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_70%	HAHAHAHA.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_71%	I hate you so much.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_72%	Well, for what is worth, I only love you.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_73%	You are constantly adorable.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_74%	Fuck you.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_75%	Hahahaha.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_79%	Listen...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_80%	I never got to thank you properly.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_81%	Ah, there's no need to, really.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_82%	It's all been you, this whole time.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_83%	No, I want to do it.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_84%	You've done so much for me these past few months...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_85%	I was lost, I was... beyond saving...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_86%	I summoned you as a last resort, and what you've given me is...
%abramar_travel_to_congress_87%	It's not just a new deck and getting to leave my house.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_88%	You brought me back to life.
%abramar_travel_to_congress_89%	Challenging me, teaching me, making me laugh, listening to me...
%abramar_hug_2%	Thank you, Ábramar.
%abramar_hug_3%	Thank you so much.
%abramar_hug_4%	...
%abramar_hug_5%	I love you.
%abramar_hug_6%	...
%abramar_hug_7%	Ah...
%abramar_hug_8%	I love you too.
%abramar_hug_9%	But you really shouldn't.
%abramar_hug_10%	I appreciate what you're saying, I really do.
%abramar_hug_11%	But I'm not doing all of this for free.
%abramar_hug_12%	Soon I'll reap something very important from you.
%abramar_hug_13%	I don't care.
%abramar_hug_14%	Right now, right here, I love you, and I am thankful.
%abramar_hug_15%	I may hate you in the future.
%abramar_hug_16%	Hell, I may even betray you. I don't really know how I'm going to react once the Fire seal activates.
%abramar_hug_17%	But in this specific moment, alone among the stars...
%abramar_hug_18%	I love you.
%abramar_hug_20%	...
%abramar_hug_21%	Thank you.
%abramar_hug_22%	Look, there it is.
%abramar_hug_23%	The House of Cosmic Providence.
%abramar_hug_24%	Moment of truth.
%abramar_hug_25%	Let's see what the cards led us to.
%congress_wheel_2%	Everything that is about to happen.
%congress_wheel_3%	Everything that will occur.
%congress_wheel_4%	None of it is your fault.
%congress_wheel_5%	But all of it is your responsibility.
%congress_wheel_6%	And that is true for every given moment of your life.
%congress_wheel_7%	And that is true for every single Witch in this cosmos.
%congress_wheel_8%	That is fate.
%congress_aedana_intro_2%	My corpse is without will.
%congress_aedana_intro_3%	But my body stands proud of the coven assembled here today.
%congress_aedana_intro_5%	A hundred voices to decide the fate of our sisterhood.
%congress_aedana_intro_6%	A hundred voices to steer this universe. Your power is enormous and it will continue to grow.
%congress_aedana_intro_7%	The House of Cosmic Providence will hold time still for us.
%congress_aedana_intro_8%	Not a single galaxy will dare spin until our coven has a new leader.
%congress_aedana_intro_9%	Now pour your voices into the Chalice and build the future upon my corpse.
%congress_begin_2%	Surrounding me, around the Chalice of Undying Legacy, we have the candidates.
%congress_begin_5%	Cupressa, the Historian.
%congress_begin_8%	Dahlia, the Daggersmith.
%congress_begin_10%	Jasmine, the Gardener.
%congress_begin_15%	Fortuna, the Soothsayer.
%congress_begin_21%	Cupressa, the Historian, should be among us too.
%congress_begin_22%	Regrettably, she stole one of my masks and disappeared. Her purpose remains unknown.
%congress_begin_23%	We will carry on without her.
%congress_begin_25%	We will soon hear our sisters' opening speeches.
%congress_begin_26%	But first, let's conjure the vote intention for all to gauge the progress of this debate.
%congress_begin_28%	And remember, in The House of Cosmic Providence, everyone is welcome to talk at any given moment, for we are all equal in discussing the fate of our sisterhood.
%congress_begin_33%	Also, we are introducing the first creation of one of our newest members.
%congress_begin_34%	Every candidate agreed to ingest one of these Truth Chili peppers.
%congress_begin_35%	So not a single lie may be spilled in these halls.
%congress_begin_36%	Voluntarily or not.
%congress_begin_38%	Now, my body shall remain silent for the rest of the debate.
%congress_begin_40%	I give the floor to the eldest of the candidates: Cupressa.
%congress_begin_43%	Thank you, Aedana.
%congress_begin_44%	I am aware that many of you are eager to leave behind the coven culture established by our former leader.
%congress_begin_45%	What I bring you here today is not a political pamphlet, but a plea.
%congress_begin_46%	I have lived through and recall every era of this coven.
%congress_begin_47%	That gives me the perspective and the confidence to assure you that our sisterhood has never been more prosperous than in Aedana's time.
%congress_begin_49%	I implore you, we must give Aedana's system a chance, experience where it takes us.
%congress_begin_51%	I know for a fact this was just the beginning of what Aedana had planned for us.
%congress_begin_53%	Her vision, the projection of her rules and system, was destined to make us the most powerful coven that's ever existed.
%congress_begin_55%	That's why my program plans to keep her design intact, with myself as a warden of its prosperity.
%congress_begin_59%	(Mmm... Cupressa's winning momentum with her conservative speech.)
%congress_begin_60%	(Should I crush her by revealing she's in love with Aedana and casting doubt over her true motivations?)
%congress_begin_63%	(Yes, time to be ruthless.)
%congress_begin_64%	(No, I'll respect her privacy...)
%congress_begin_69%	Ah... If I may, I must interject here.
%congress_begin_71%	...Oh?
%congress_begin_73%	Normally I would stay away from this kind of... information.
%congress_begin_74%	But I believe this to be relevant to the matter at hand.
%congress_begin_75%	Cupressa is in love with Aedana.
%congress_begin_78%	Oh!
%congress_begin_81%	Whaaaat!?
%congress_begin_83%	...
%congress_begin_84%	So. You are resorting to this.
%congress_begin_87%	I inherited one of Aedana's eyes. I can see through Cupressa.
%congress_begin_88%	You are in love with Aedana, and that's why you plan to keep her corpse intact.
%congress_begin_90%	Your judgment is compromised.
%congress_begin_92%	I...
%congress_begin_93%	I understand. You speak the truth, and it is only fair that our sisters know about it.
%congress_begin_94%	Emotion aside, I can still corroborate that Aedana's mandate has given us the best times our coven has ever experienced.
%congress_begin_95%	We should stick to her plan.
%congress_begin_99%	(It doesn't feel right. I'll drop it.)
%congress_begin_101%	Having said that, I am genuinely interested in hearing all about the alternatives our sisters have devised for our coven.
%congress_begin_104%	And I'd like to give the floor to our youngest:
%congress_begin_105%	Fortuna, if you please.
%congress_begin_108%	And I'd like to give the floor to our fiercest: Dahlia.
%congress_begin_111%	And I'd like to give the floor to our kindest: Jasmine.
%congress_begin_115%	For the love of the Fifth and Sixth voices and the wrath of the Fourth, I hereby declare:
%congress_begin_116%	What the golden masks built shall be worshiped as the mandate of the truest gods.
%congress_begin_117%	Physics, chemistry, and quantum truth! The rules of the cosmos as written in the original book.
%congress_begin_118%	We will follow Aedana, or I shall devour every soul in this House and then even more!
%congress_begin_120%	NOW, LET'S INDULGE IN THE WORDS OF THE EGOIST HUMANS.
%congress_begin_123%	FORTUNA, I CALL UPON YOU.
%congress_begin_125%	Ah... sure?
%congress_begin_128%	DAHLIA, I CALL UPON YOU.
%congress_begin_131%	Hahahaha, what's going on with her?
%congress_begin_134%	JASMINE, I CALL UPON YOU.
%congress_begin_137%	Oh, no... Is she feeling well?
%congress_begin_139%	I'll focus on the debate for now...
%congress_begin_141%	(I totally destroyed her mind with my cards... poor Cupressa.)
%congress_begin_149%	Alright, Fortuna, moment of truth.
%congress_begin_151%	I'll be by your side the whole time. It's my role to offer you counsel throughout the debate.
%congress_begin_152%	Right now, I'd say you should focus more on setting a tone than getting into any specific point.
%congress_begin_154%	You got this.
%congress_begin_156%	Thank you, Pat.
%congress_begin_157%	(Ok. How should I open...)
%congress_begin_160%	(Humble and conciliatory.)
%congress_begin_161%	(Ambitious and confident.)
%congress_begin_162%	(Authoritative and relentless.)
%congress_begin_166%	A Witch of my status is humbled by being able to speak here today, before all of you.
%congress_begin_167%	I am lucky to not only get to showcase my ideas for our sisterhood, but to debate them with my elders.
%congress_begin_168%	I implore you to have patience and understanding.
%congress_begin_172%	I'm extremely excited to be here today!
%congress_begin_173%	We are so close to turning over a new leaf and growing beyond the old ways!
%congress_begin_174%	The sisterhood I envision for us all is the product of both analysis and empathy, put through the fires of divination!
%congress_begin_175%	I bring you not only prosperity, but happiness and fulfillment!
%congress_begin_179%	Listen to me, my sisters!
%congress_begin_180%	Join me in writing a new page in the history of this coven!
%congress_begin_181%	We've suffered the ill-devised systems of Aedana long enough, focused only on results and not on satisfaction.
%congress_begin_182%	But it's time to take hold of our sisterhood again.
%congress_begin_183%	My intimate relationship with fate, my exhaustive comprehension of it, is the key to a joyous future!
%congress_begin_184%	I am the one who can take you there!
%congress_begin_189%	(Mmm... it's working, I did well to match the vibe I sealed with Ábramar for my Air energies...)
%congress_begin_192%	Good job, you won their hearts.
%congress_begin_198%	(Mmm... it's not working. I shouldn't swim against the vibe I sealed with Ábramar for my Air energies...)
%congress_begin_201%	Come on, you should stay true to yourself.
%congress_begin_203%	But let's push forward.
%congress_begin_205%	Now to sell what's truly important.
%congress_begin_207%	(Mmm... What should be the main focus of my speech?)
%congress_begin_210%	(An oracle should be at the helm.)
%congress_begin_211%	(We should build a caring and benevolent coven.)
%congress_begin_212%	(We must devour Aedana.)
%congress_begin_213%	(We must scatter Aedana and increase our numbers.)
%congress_begin_214%	(Sell the superleader idea. I'll eat Aedana.)
%congress_begin_218%	We must count ourselves lucky. We're living a change of leadership that is not fueled by greed or power struggles.
%congress_begin_219%	I'm so happy to see that every candidate is fighting for their ideal version of this sisterhood.
%congress_begin_220%	I've studied every program carefully and all of them are rooted in love and respect for our sisters.
%congress_begin_221%	I am truly, truly happy. My mind is at ease: this coven will prosper no matter what.
%congress_begin_222%	That's why I want to put the focus on the differentiating element, which is not the program but the person.
%congress_begin_223%	We can choose to be led by a daggersmith, a gardener, a historian or...
%congress_begin_224%	A fortune teller.
%congress_begin_225%	I am someone who has an intimate relationship with the future.
%congress_begin_226%	Leading is about taking a community towards the future. Leading is about building that future.
%congress_begin_227%	And, ask any of your sisters: I have never been wrong.
%congress_begin_228%	I engage with the future with heightened, unprecedented awareness.
%congress_begin_229%	I am the only one with enough mastery over her talents to guarantee you, with 100% accuracy, that I can deliver the vision I'm presenting to you.
%congress_begin_230%	I already built the gate. You just need to decide to enter it with me.
%congress_begin_234%	"Take fate into thy hands."
%congress_begin_240%	Even if Aedana brought us unprecedented progress in magical knowledge and a growth in power...
%congress_begin_241%	We must agree that she also brought us little if any of what truly gives meaning to immortal existence:
%congress_begin_242%	Joy, happiness, delight, pleasure.
%congress_begin_243%	None of us ascended just to be chained back to a system that exploits us, that sees the members of its community as a commodity.
%congress_begin_244%	My vision is to strike the perfect balance between growth and satisfaction.
%congress_begin_245%	And this growth is going to be focused on our personal development, not on the potency or status of our coven.
%congress_begin_246%	The betterment of our members is the only true path to the betterment of our sisterhood.
%congress_begin_252%	That's what our slogan has always meant:
%congress_begin_253%	"A very happy coven."
%congress_begin_254%	It may be corny, but it should be what we all strive for.
%congress_begin_257%	That's always been what I meant by "A real sisterhood".
%congress_begin_258%	Our slogan embodies that desire to become sisters again, not pieces of Aedana's machine.
%congress_begin_261%	That's always been what I meant by our slogan: "Stronger together."
%congress_begin_262%	Stronger not against adversity, but in taking care of each other, together.
%congress_begin_264%	Vote for me to reclaim all the happiness we sacrificed to Aedana's soulless designs.
%congress_begin_268%	We must count ourselves lucky. We're living a change of leadership that is not fueled by greed or power struggles.
%congress_begin_269%	I'm so happy to see that every candidate is fighting for their ideal version of this sisterhood.
%congress_begin_270%	I've studied every program carefully and all of them are rooted in love and respect for our sisters.
%congress_begin_271%	I am truly, truly happy. My mind is at ease: this coven will prosper no matter what.
%congress_begin_272%	That's why I want to put the focus on what truly matters when it comes to being able to make those visions a reality.
%congress_begin_273%	We need power.
%congress_begin_274%	Witches have the potential to shape the very cosmos, but we do need power to do it.
%congress_begin_275%	That's why we must devour Aedana.
%congress_begin_276%	There will be the time for welcoming more sisters, and becoming more and more diverse.
%congress_begin_277%	But first, we should... no, we must: create a coven with which we can properly welcome all those novices.
%congress_begin_278%	Aedana left us a hyperfunctional community, but we're barely a sisterhood anymore.
%congress_begin_279%	Let's devour her and turn her power into a brand new coven. One which we can proudly welcome new Witches into.
%congress_begin_285%	Even with all we endured under Aedana, one thing is true:
%congress_begin_286%	The hardships our former leader put us through have made us all stronger, more capable.
%congress_begin_287%	But it's been centuries of struggle, and even though we will never truly repair all the damage Aedana's system caused...
%congress_begin_288%	We can use the strength this ordeal granted to all of us who survived it to create a healthier and more welcoming sisterhood.
%congress_begin_289%	A place in which we no longer exploit our sisters' powers but nurture them.
%congress_begin_290%	Growth based on love and support.
%congress_begin_291%	And one thing we certainly don't need right now is more power and ambition.
%congress_begin_292%	It's time to heal.
%congress_begin_293%	We need to learn new ways and open our minds. Minds that Aedana ground down to the hilt with her exploitation.
%congress_begin_294%	We must scatter her remains and allow more women to ascend and become Witches.
%congress_begin_295%	New faces, new spirits, and new ideas will dissipate our trauma and let us see beyond what we've become.
%congress_begin_296%	That is, in my opinion, the most crucial point of this debate.
%congress_begin_302%	I know what you're all thinking.
%congress_begin_303%	No matter how sound my program looks, there's one point that may be making you all think I've gone mad.
%congress_begin_304%	Let's tackle it up front.
%congress_begin_305%	Yes, I plan on devouring Aedana.
%congress_begin_306%	All by myself.
%congress_begin_307%	This is without precedent, and we can't even gauge the depth of its implications.
%congress_begin_308%	The amount of sheer power that will be held within a single Witch.
%congress_begin_309%	A Super Witch.
%congress_begin_310%	And I know, many of you are curious. Some of you are even attracted to this idea. But it raises another question:
%congress_begin_311%	Why me? Why Fortuna?
%congress_begin_314%	(Confess that you can shape reality.)
%congress_begin_315%	(Sell it as fortune-telling.)
%congress_begin_320%	Because I mastered the ability to shape reality.
%congress_begin_321%	I have discovered that what I do with my cards is not divination. I am altering existence.
%congress_begin_322%	I can write the future and edit the past.
%congress_begin_323%	If you allow me to absorb Aedana, I will become the closest thing there's ever been to a Witch God!
%congress_begin_325%	I could grant all your wishes!
%congress_begin_326%	I could make us all the strongest, the happiest, the most advanced and knowledgeable!
%congress_begin_327%	If you vote for me...
%congress_begin_328%	We can have it all!
%congress_begin_336%	(No... I can't lie... the Truth Chili is forcing me to confess...)
%congress_begin_339%	Because I have an intimate relationship with the future.
%congress_begin_340%	Leading is about taking a community towards the future. Leading is about building that future.
%congress_begin_341%	And, ask any of your sisters: I have never been wrong.
%congress_begin_342%	I engage with the future with heightened, unprecedented awareness.
%congress_begin_343%	If you'd allow me to devour Aedana, to become a Super Witch...
%congress_begin_344%	I could see every path. I could take us anywhere. Fate would become clay in our hands.
%congress_begin_350%	LISTEN TO ME EVERYONE!
%congress_begin_352%	(Mmm... Dahlia has chosen me as her second, so my role here is to advise her as she goes. I might need to modulate or reel in her speeches...)
%congress_begin_355%	I have a clear vision for this coven!
%congress_begin_356%	(Ok... how should I suggest Dahlia opens...)
%congress_begin_359%	(Start by being humble and conciliatory.)
%congress_begin_360%	(Go ambitious and confident.)
%congress_begin_361%	(No quarter: Authoritative and relentless.)
%congress_begin_366%	Dahlia, I suggest--
%congress_begin_369%	COMMUNITY! SISTERHOOD! SOLIDARITY!
%congress_begin_371%	SUPPORT! DIVERSITY! ALL WITCHES EQUAL!!
%congress_begin_372%	(Alright, this is going to be trickier than I thought.)
%congress_begin_374%	(Her energy is kinda working, though.)
%congress_begin_376%	And there's one crucial aspect we need to make this vision happen!
%congress_begin_377%	(Ok, this is my opening, let's direct her speech towards...)
%congress_begin_380%	(Horizontalism. Shared power.)
%congress_begin_381%	(Support system. The magical tax.)
%congress_begin_382%	(We must scatter Aedana and increase our numbers.)
%congress_begin_387%	(Horizontalism. Gotcha. Thank you.)
%congress_begin_389%	HORIZONTALISM!
%congress_begin_391%	Our community is not so big that we should put our fate in the hands of just a few.
%congress_begin_393%	The opinion of every single Witch should bear the same weight!
%congress_begin_395%	The referendum system we want to implement will make sure that not a single choice is made to the detriment of the community ever again.
%congress_begin_397%	No more impositions like the obnoxious quarterly controls.
%congress_begin_398%	No more excessive punishments!
%congress_begin_401%	We must reclaim this coven for ourselves!
%congress_begin_407%	(Support and taxes. Gotcha. Thank you.)
%congress_begin_409%	WE MUST SUPPORT EACH OTHER!
%congress_begin_411%	We've had enough of working for the good of someone else!
%congress_begin_413%	The coven should be at the service of its members, not the other way around!
%congress_begin_414%	I plan to build a coven around the concept of cooperation.
%congress_begin_416%	We help each other, we teach each other, we empower each other!
%congress_begin_418%	We can accomplish this with the magical tax!
%congress_begin_419%	A pool of resources to develop projects for the common wellbeing!
%congress_begin_421%	Everyone's contribution proportional to their wealth!
%congress_begin_423%	No more unfair trials or demands, imposed by a ruthless ruler.
%congress_begin_428%	We'll make something good even from failure and mistakes!
%congress_begin_430%	The community service system will turn punishment into an act of love and collaboration!
%congress_begin_435%	(Scatter Aedana. Gotcha. Thank you.)
%congress_begin_437%	WE MUST SCATTER AEDANA'S CORPSE AND BECOME MORE!
%congress_begin_439%	New faces!
%congress_begin_441%	New beliefs! New ideas!
%congress_begin_443%	That's where true growth resides!
%congress_begin_445%	Can't you see that if we allow ourselves to give in to our power cravings we'll remain the same?
%congress_begin_446%	What good is power if we become stale?
%congress_begin_448%	Real power comes with no shortcuts. It's better and more interesting to grow in every direction with every new Witch we meet!
%congress_begin_450%	Let's make this coven exciting again!
%congress_begin_457%	I am so happy to be here in front of all of my sisters today!
%congress_begin_459%	(Mmm... Jasmine has chosen me as her second, so my role here is to advise her as she goes. I might need to modulate or reel in her speeches....)
%congress_begin_462%	I...
%congress_begin_463%	(Ok... how should I suggest Jasmine opens...)
%congress_begin_466%	(Start by being humble and conciliatory.)
%congress_begin_467%	(Go ambitious and confident.)
%congress_begin_468%	(No quarter: Authoritative and relentless.)
%congress_begin_472%	I thank you all for the opportunity to present my plan for an ideal coven.
%congress_begin_474%	I'm really moved by all the support we've received so far.
%congress_begin_476%	And I understand why so many of you still have your doubts about the picture I'm trying to paint.
%congress_begin_478%	But hopefully after I explain our ideas before all of you...
%congress_begin_480%	I can get you all as excited as I am for the future of our sisterhood!
%congress_begin_482%	(That was a good move, it really fit with Jasmine's personality.)
%congress_begin_487%	I'm excited to finally be able to present you the wonderful ideas I've cooked up with my team!
%congress_begin_489%	I have no doubt that when you hear about the finer points of our program you'll all be as excited as we are!
%congress_begin_490%	The coven we can build together is not only the strong sisterhood that we already are...
%congress_begin_492%	I will fill this community with happiness, pride and success!
%congress_begin_494%	I am determined to make each one of you here today thrive beyond your wildest expectations!
%congress_begin_496%	(Not bad... although this kind of grandiose speech isn't Jasmine's forté.)
%congress_begin_501%	I have a duty. We have a duty.
%congress_begin_502%	Aedana has spent centuries building a powerful coven.
%congress_begin_504%	And she succeeded greatly at that task.
%congress_begin_506%	But now, we must grow beyond it.
%congress_begin_507%	And our program is the best suited to do that!
%congress_begin_509%	Hear me out. What I bring you here today is the best possible future.
%congress_begin_511%	(Oops... it seems our sisters aren't really buying Jasmine as an authoritative figure.)
%congress_begin_515%	(Moving on... Where should we put the focus for the opening speech?)
%congress_begin_518%	(Freedom and trust.)
%congress_begin_519%	(Quorum of the eldest: wisdom and guidance.)
%congress_begin_520%	(We must devour Aedana.)
%congress_begin_524%	We must be grateful for everything Aedana's given us.
%congress_begin_525%	She's made us grow in an unprecedented way.
%congress_begin_527%	But it's time we stop being treated like children.
%congress_begin_529%	We need to grow beyond her system, with all her controls and punishments that made us behave like a well-oiled machine.
%congress_begin_531%	I want to take us all into an era of freedom and trust.
%congress_begin_533%	We've learned the benefits of hard work and sacrifice.
%congress_begin_534%	Now it's up to every Witch to decide how to improve our sisterhood.
%congress_begin_535%	We are more powerful, we are wiser, we are very capable of being responsible towards our coven without impositions of any kind.
%congress_begin_536%	Our program is the next step to ensure the full maturity of our coven!
%congress_begin_542%	We have lost a very important figure in our community.
%congress_begin_543%	Aedana blessed us with infinite wisdom and took us this far.
%congress_begin_544%	Well beyond what we would have expected from ourselves.
%congress_begin_546%	We have a lot to be thankful for!
%congress_begin_548%	And I'm determined to expand on Aedana's work and make sure we all thrive even further.
%congress_begin_549%	That's why I'm betting on the Quorum of the Eldest, to profit from the guidance the most veteran Witches have to offer.
%congress_begin_550%	Consider the peace of letting ourselves be guided by caring hands!
%congress_begin_551%	Enjoy the freedom of pursuing your own interests and projects, knowing that the most experienced souls have their trustworthy hands on the wheel.
%congress_begin_553%	Witch life is about to get way more enjoyable!
%congress_begin_559%	We have lost a very important figure in our community.
%congress_begin_560%	The loss of Aedana is sure to rock the stability she built for all of us.
%congress_begin_562%	We must make sure that all her outstanding work isn't wasted without her guidance.
%congress_begin_564%	Though I am sure that the Quorum of the Eldest is the closest we can get to Aedana's infinite wisdom...
%congress_begin_566%	We must also become stronger.
%congress_begin_567%	Aedana's body is her parting gift, and we must make the most of it.
%congress_begin_569%	To have her live through us! To welcome her powers into us! It'll open the doors to never before seen wonders!
%congress_begin_570%	Think of all of our talents combined, empowered by our former leader's strength!
%congress_begin_572%	I'm sure there's nothing we can't overcome once we absorb her.
%congress_begin_578%	Wait a minute!
%congress_kurielle_3%	Sisters, I want to share some findings with you.
%congress_kurielle_5%	I'm not proud of the methods I used but...
%congress_kurielle_6%	I was worried about letting a dangerous exile into coven politics...
%congress_kurielle_10%	So I created an illusory world to draw some raw truth from Fortuna.
%congress_kurielle_13%	So I created an illusory world to draw some raw truth from Fortuna, the oracle exile supporting Dahlia's party.
%congress_kurielle_16%	So I created an illusory world to draw some raw truth from Fortuna, the oracle exile supporting Jasmine's party.
%congress_kurielle_19%	What I found...
%congress_kurielle_27%	Is that we've got nothing to worry about.
%congress_kurielle_28%	If anything, this Witch may be a bit too naive.
%congress_kurielle_29%	She expressed that her purpose is "to make everybody happy."
%congress_kurielle_32%	Anyway...
%congress_kurielle_34%	I'll let you all proceed, thank you for listening to me.
%congress_kurielle_39%	Is that Fortuna has the ability to alter this reality!
%congress_kurielle_40%	What she does is not divination. It is writing the future itself!
%congress_kurielle_42%	The implications of this are too severe! We must adjourn this congress until we decide how to deal with her!
%congress_kurielle_44%	...
%congress_kurielle_47%	Incommensurable power is not a violation of the rules of this community.
%congress_kurielle_49%	Congress shall proceed as planned.
%congress_kurielle_52%	But...
%congress_kurielle_54%	Whether this information is relevant to the choice of a new leader is left to the judgment of each of our sisters.
%congress_kurielle_56%	And as such, they shall express themselves through their votes.
%congress_kurielle_59%	But... This isn't fair...
%congress_kurielle_61%	Do you have any other relevant information to disclose to the coven?
%congress_kurielle_64%	...
%congress_kurielle_65%	No.
%congress_kurielle_67%	But I beg all of you to be very careful with who we surrender the fate of this coven to.
%congress_kurielle_74%	Fortuna herself confessed to me in the dream that she's been abusing her powers to manipulate these elections!
%congress_kurielle_76%	We must be very careful with her.
%congress_kurielle_80%	Is that we've got nothing to worry about.
%congress_kurielle_81%	If there's any doubt that I have, it's that this Witch may be a bit too ambitious.
%congress_kurielle_82%	She expressed that her purpose is "to make us more powerful than ever."
%congress_kurielle_84%	But I say we can trust her.
%congress_kurielle_88%	Is that exile may have caused her to enter some sort of delusional state.
%congress_kurielle_89%	She expressed that her purpose is "to reshape the whole universe."
%congress_kurielle_90%	And I could tell it wasn't a metaphor.
%congress_kurielle_92%	She truly is after a complete reconfiguration of our reality, and that... sounds dangerous to me.
%congress_kurielle_94%	Please, keep that in mind while you cast your votes today...
%congress_kurielle_96%	That'll be all.
%congress_kurielle_100%	Is that her motives for joining these elections may be somewhat tainted.
%congress_kurielle_101%	She literally told me that her objective is to "undo the damage our last leader caused."
%congress_kurielle_103%	That doesn't sound like a positive agenda to me.
%congress_kurielle_105%	I don't know what to do with this information.
%congress_kurielle_106%	I'm just sharing it before the whole sisterhood so you can cast your vote with all the information possible.
%congress_kurielle_110%	Fortuna even confessed her deep hatred for our leader.
%congress_kurielle_111%	I wouldn't put it past her to be behind the early demise of Aedana...
%congress_kurielle_113%	Please, be very careful with how you cast your vote today...
%congress_louise_4%	Sorry for intruding so early on in the debate...
%congress_louise_7%	But I just wanted to offer my input on the candidate Witch Fortuna.
%congress_louise_10%	But I just wanted to offer my input on Dahlia's right hand: Witch Fortuna.
%congress_louise_13%	But I just wanted to offer my input on Jasmine's right hand: Witch Fortuna.
%congress_louise_16%	I came to her for help, as suggested by my friend and leader candidate Jasmine.
%congress_louise_17%	I was in a dire situation, handling a gruesome task Aedana imposed upon me, and...
%congress_louise_20%	...Fortuna suggested I start World War III on planet Earth.
%congress_louise_23%	No. Aedana tasked you with that. I only offered my help.
%congress_louise_24%	I'm sorry Louise, I was only trying to help you.
%congress_louise_25%	That's right. Mortals are a commodity we should be exploiting.
%congress_louise_30%	No. Aedana tasked you with that. I only offered my help.
%congress_louise_33%	I came to you to help me escape that situation!
%congress_louise_34%	You don't understand your sisters' struggles! Exile has eaten away your humanity!
%congress_louise_36%	You're blowing this out of proportion.
%congress_louise_38%	We should put personal squabbles aside and focus on the elections.
%congress_louise_40%	Fine. I just wanted to say my piece.
%congress_louise_41%	I'll let you all continue.
%congress_louise_47%	I'm sorry Louise, I was only trying to help you.
%congress_louise_53%	That's right. Mortals are a commodity we should be exploiting.
%congress_louise_57%	How can you say that!?
%congress_louise_59%	Haven't you checked our program?
%congress_louise_61%	We plan to keep exploiting mortals however necessary.
%congress_louise_62%	Your testimony is only a confirmation of how committed we are to our program.
%congress_louise_66%	So maybe this sisterhood isn't for me after all.
%congress_louise_67%	I truly hope your party doesn't win.
%congress_louise_72%	Fortuna, with her cards, not only helped me get out of it, she allowed me to find a happiness I hadn't experienced before.
%congress_louise_73%	Her guidance was otherworldly. Her deck is powerful and her soul is pure.
%congress_louise_74%	Please, we need her party at the helm.
%congress_louise_77%	That's all I wanted to say.
%congress_louise_78%	Thank you for everything, Fortuna.
%congress_2_3%	Let us move on to another candidate.
%congress_2_5%	Dahlia, offer your opening statement.
%congress_2_8%	LISTEN TO ME EVERYONE!
%congress_2_10%	I have a clear vision for this coven!
%congress_2_12%	COMMUNITY! SISTERHOOD! SOLIDARITY!
%congress_2_14%	SUPPORT! DIVERSITY! ALL WITCHES EQUAL!!
%congress_2_16%	And there's one crucial aspect to making this vision happen!
%congress_2_18%	HORIZONTALISM!
%congress_2_20%	Our community is not so big that we should put our fate in the hands of just a few.
%congress_2_22%	The opinion of every single Witch should bear the same weight!
%congress_2_24%	The referendum system we want to implement will make sure that not a single choice is made to the detriment of the community ever again.
%congress_2_26%	No more impositions like the obnoxious quarterly controls.
%congress_2_27%	No more excessive punishments!
%congress_2_29%	We must reclaim this coven for ourselves!
%congress_2_34%	Jasmine, offer your opening statement.
%congress_2_36%	Thank you, Aedana.
%congress_2_38%	I am so happy to be in front of all of my sisters here today!
%congress_2_39%	I thank you all for the opportunity to present my plan for an ideal coven.
%congress_2_41%	I'm really moved by all the support we've received this far.
%congress_2_43%	And I understand why so many of you still have your doubts about the picture I'm trying to paint.
%congress_2_45%	But hopefully after I explain our ideas before all of you...
%congress_2_47%	I can get you all as excited as I am for the future of our sisterhood!
%congress_2_49%	We must be grateful for everything Aedana's given us.
%congress_2_50%	She's made us grow in an unprecedented way.
%congress_2_52%	But it's time we stop being treated like children.
%congress_2_54%	We need to grow beyond her system, with all her controls and punishments that made us behave like a well-oiled machine.
%congress_2_56%	I want to take us all into an era of freedom and trust.
%congress_2_58%	We've learned the benefits of hard work and sacrifice.
%congress_2_59%	Now it's up to every Witch to decide how to improve our sisterhood.
%congress_2_60%	We are more powerful, we are wiser, we are very capable of being responsible towards our coven without impositions of any kind.
%congress_2_61%	Our program is the next step to ensure the full maturity of our coven!
%congress_2_66%	I must speak!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_4%	Hold on right there.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_5%	I'm sorry, but I must interject.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_6%	We should make it our duty to call on Dahlia's demagogy every time she goes on a motivational speech.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_7%	The most dangerous part is that Dahlia is unaware of the demagogy herself.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_8%	I'll concede that her discourse feels really pure and wholehearted... Dahlia honestly believes in the utopia she's selling, but!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_9%	It's all buzzwords!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_11%	Community, sisterhood, solidarity, support, diversity, and... Horizontalism!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_13%	Yet not a single laid out plan on how to implement all that effectively!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_16%	That's not true!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_19%	Oh, right, you do have a plan, but that's the weakest part of your program.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_22%	...?
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_25%	You are betting everything on the goodwill of our sisters.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_27%	Trust is a beautiful concept but, look at us, here in congress, with radically opposed visions.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_29%	Yet you want us to buy this whole amicable resolution system? All voices chiming in for every decision?
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_30%	Your horizontalism is a system that doesn't acknowledge the convoluted reality of our sisterhood!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_31%	It's a system for the coven you wished you were in, not the one we currently inhabit!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_35%	I...
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_36%	Of course I designed a system for the coven I wish to be in!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_37%	We can't surrender to an idiosyncrasy below our potential!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_38%	Maybe... maybe I just believe in my sisters more than you'll ever be able to!
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_41%	I'm sure you do.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_42%	That's all I had to say, anyway.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_43%	Thanks for listening to me.
%congress_patrice_vs_dahlia_46%	...
%congress_grethe_3%	Hello.
%congress_grethe_5%	Sorry for interrupting the debate so early.
%congress_grethe_8%	Sorry for halting the conversations again.
%congress_grethe_10%	For those who don't know me, I'm Grethe, a Witch Architect... you may have used one of my thought shrines.
%congress_grethe_11%	I'll cut to the chase.
%congress_grethe_13%	Recent experiences have made me connect with the forbidden.
%congress_grethe_15%	I have summoned a Behemoth.
%congress_grethe_19%	What!?
%congress_grethe_22%	This person shouldn't be allowed to participate in congress!
%congress_grethe_24%	Time holds still in the House of Cosmic Providence.
%congress_grethe_25%	Should Grethe be apprehended, it will be right after we conclude the debate.
%congress_grethe_26%	For now, we should listen to every voice.
%congress_grethe_28%	Thank you, Aedana.
%congress_grethe_29%	It's important for the future of our coven that you all listen to this.
%congress_grethe_30%	I didn't only summon the Behemoth. I fused with them.
%congress_grethe_33%	Fortuna helped me get rid of them, but... in the time we were together, some knowledge was left lingering in my mind.
%congress_grethe_36%	As you can see, it's flowing out of my head.
%congress_grethe_39%	In fact, I have assimilated it and now it lives inside of me.
%congress_grethe_42%	I was scared at first, but it allowed me to comprehend this cosmos in a way that I would never have dreamed that I could achieve.
%congress_grethe_43%	And it's becoming clear as these ideas mature in my limited Witch brain, constrained by the rules of physics.
%congress_grethe_45%	Behemoths are not our enemies.
%congress_grethe_46%	Every disaster linked to a Behemoth has not been caused by them, but by the Witches who accessed their power.
%congress_grethe_47%	It's us who are dangerous, not them.
%congress_grethe_49%	And the ideas and comprehension of this reality that Gaethëryan is allowing me to experience...
%congress_grethe_51%	I want this elevated form of enlightenment for all of you!
%congress_grethe_53%	Reality is way more malleable than we think!
%congress_grethe_55%	We are shackled by how our mortal selves first entered into contact with this universe.
%congress_grethe_57%	But we can be anything we want to be! There's happiness beyond happiness!
%congress_grethe_58%	There's existence without language, absolute and incorruptible communication!
%congress_grethe_60%	I could end my speech here telling you all that what we should do is to vote for Dahlia and welcome the forbidden into our lives.
%congress_grethe_62%	But!
%congress_grethe_63%	There's something even greater at play here today.
%congress_grethe_65%	Fortuna.
%congress_grethe_67%	What are you doing, Grethe...
%congress_grethe_71%	Gaethëryan allowed me to know that there are more Behemoth users in our coven.
%congress_grethe_72%	This is in part how I know this is the correct path.
%congress_grethe_75%	Trust me.
%congress_grethe_78%	Trust me, my love.
%congress_grethe_80%	Fortuna!
%congress_grethe_81%	Care to share your experience with the Behemoth with all your sisters!?
%congress_grethe_84%	What is the meaning of this?
%congress_grethe_86%	...
%congress_grethe_88%	Tell all of our sisters how high we could ascend should we dispel these absurd traditions that make us live in fear of the forbidden!
%congress_grethe_91%	I don't know what she's talking about.
%congress_grethe_92%	It's true. Show yourself, Ábramar.
%congress_grethe_93%	(Remain silent.)
%congress_grethe_94%	I deny everything. This Witch has lost her mind to the Behemoth.
%congress_grethe_95%	Let me explain! I'm the victim here!
%congress_grethe_96%	That's outrageous! She's trying to sabotage our party!
%congress_arbiter_5%	I'm sorry to disrupt such a critical moment for your coven.
%congress_arbiter_6%	But it's imperative that I bring the concerns of the Arbitrage Office before all of you.
%congress_arbiter_7%	As you may know, we recently had to deal with one of your sisters, Grethe, who had formed a pact with a Behemoth.
%congress_arbiter_8%	We managed to imprison the being who had fused themselves with Grethe's body.
%congress_arbiter_9%	And... after several intense submission spells, we managed to extract some worrying information from them.
%congress_arbiter_10%	...
%congress_arbiter_11%	The Arbitrage Office has grounds to believe there is yet another practitioner of the forbidden among you.
%congress_arbiter_14%	That can't be possible!
%congress_arbiter_16%	...
%congress_arbiter_18%	I'm sorry. We're convinced there is a Behemoth meddling with these elections.
%congress_arbiter_20%	...
%congress_arbiter_22%	...We're also pretty certain as to who is responsible.
%congress_arbiter_23%	But we'd like to extend the courtesy for that Witch to honorably surrender herself.
%congress_arbiter_24%	Or to any of you to do the right thing and expose her before the whole coven.
%congress_arbiter_25%	If not, I'll be forced to bring the prime suspects in with me for a less amicable interrogation process.
%congress_arbiter_27%	This is not acceptable. The sanctity of this congress must not be interrupted by an external party.
%congress_arbiter_29%	I'm afraid there's no alternative. We can't risk a Behemoth user becoming the next leader of this coven.
%congress_arbiter_30%	...It may be too late, then.
%congress_arbiter_32%	...
%congress_arbiter_33%	Very well.
%congress_arbiter_34%	Sisters, we shall comply with the Magical Pact.
%congress_arbiter_35%	Confess now, Witch, or bring your whole coven down with you.
%congress_arbiter_38%	(Remain silent.)
%congress_arbiter_39%	(Confess everything.)
%chaos_laments_2%	Aaaaargh!
%chaos_laments_4%	It hurts!
%chaos_laments_6%	Make it stop!
%chaos_laments_8%	What's going on!?
%chaos_laments_10%	Somebody help me!
%chaos_confusion_2%	What the hell is going on!?
%chaos_confusion_3%	They're trapped in a ball of fire!
%chaos_confusion_4%	We need to save them!
%chaos_confusion_8%	...Is this... the end of our coven?
%chaos_confusion_11%	FIRE AND AIR IN FULL VORTEX AROUND US!
%chaos_confusion_12%	REJOICE, YOU WAILING SOULS!
%chaos_confusion_14%	FORTUNA! DO SOMETHING!
%chaos_confusion_15%	Me!?
%chaos_confusion_16%	YES!
%chaos_confusion_17%	Dahlia! Calm down! What can Fortuna possibly do about this?
%chaos_confusion_18%	No... Dahlia's gut is right, as always...
%chaos_confusion_19%	Let me collect my thoughts for a second.
%chaos_confusion_decision_2%	...
%chaos_confusion_decision_3%	I'm going to use my cards to make sense of what is going on here.
%chaos_confusion_decision_7%	I'm aware of the paradox it entails...
%chaos_confusion_decision_8%	Looking into the origin is going to define what caused this to begin with.
%chaos_confusion_decision_9%	But we must do something.
%chaos_confusion_decision_12%	If we understand why this is happening, we may be able to do something about it.
%spread_congress_intro_2%	Everyone focus on the coven.
%spread_congress_intro_4%	Project your feelings towards our sisterhood into my deck.
%spread_congress_destruction_6%	This is a final test designed by Aedana, the conclusion of her attempt to create the most powerful coven in existence.
%spread_congress_destruction_7%	She has been grinding us to the bone and engineered this crisis to prove she's been right all along and open our minds to real power.
%spread_congress_destruction_12%	Junreisha is trying to turn us all into power. She scribbled her formulas upon every column to turn congress into an instrument for magical synthesis.
%spread_congress_destruction_13%	She is feeding from this ball of fire as we speak.
%spread_congress_destruction_17%	Even while in the holding cells of the Arbitrage Office.
%spread_congress_destruction_22%	...Ábramar used me to take revenge on the coven that banished him.
%spread_congress_destruction_23%	Ábramar is... the Behemoth I summoned to regain my freedom.
%spread_congress_destruction_24%	I'm so sorry...
%spread_congress_destruction_25%	And now...
%spread_congress_destruction_30%	This is a covert op by the Arbitrage Office to keep us from becoming too powerful and conquering the magical world.
%spread_congress_destruction_31%	Their official role is to uphold the Magical Pact, but...
%spread_congress_destruction_32%	This is not the first hit they have committed on the magical community.
%spread_congress_destruction_33%	They aim to keep peace and balance, no matter the cost.
%spread_congress_destruction_34%	They destroyed the House of Cosmic Providence with all of us inside because they feared they wouldn't be able to control us anymore.
%spread_congress_destruction_39%	Cupressa, unable to process the death of Aedana, is determined to end the coven to keep the work of our leader from being corrupted.
%spread_congress_destruction_40%	She has brought down the House of Cosmic Providence to burn us all inside.
%spread_congress_destruction_45%	It's my fault... I have become too powerful and the House of Cosmic Providence imploded trying to stop time and fate around me.
%spread_congress_destruction_46%	And now we're all trapped in this massive ball of flames... I'm so sorry...
%spread_congress_destruction_47%	This is all my fault. Everything is my fault.
%spread_congress_destruction_48%	And now...
%spread_congress_followup_2%	Since time can't flow until we reach a decision as to who'll become the next leader...
%spread_congress_followup_3%	Our sisters are doomed to burn eternally.
%spread_congress_followup_5%	We must come to an agreement to free them.
%spread_congress_followup_16%	I can't believe this fucking hag!
%spread_congress_followup_17%	For real, Aedana!? What the fuck do you want from us!?
%spread_congress_followup_19%	...
%spread_congress_followup_22%	Come on, Dahlia, I'm sure Aedana had her reasons... right?
%spread_congress_followup_24%	...
%spread_congress_followup_27%	You can't be such a fucking dog, Jasmine.
%spread_congress_followup_28%	Wake the fuck up, Aedana is messed up!
%spread_congress_followup_31%	Oh, Aedana, I see it! This is glorious!
%spread_congress_followup_32%	If we couldn't protect our sisters from impending doom we're not worthy at all to follow in your footsteps!
%spread_congress_followup_36%	Well, you're right, Dahlia...
%spread_congress_followup_38%	This is way too much.
%spread_congress_followup_39%	No lesson or test is worth risking the lives of all of our sisters.
%spread_congress_followup_46%	I can't believe Junreisha is trying to turn us all into... energy?
%spread_congress_followup_48%	I would never have expected this from one of our sisters...
%spread_congress_followup_51%	I'm going to fucking kill her when we're out of here.
%spread_congress_followup_54%	You're way too naive.
%spread_congress_followup_55%	That's why your programs were destined to fail.
%spread_congress_followup_57%	This wouldn't have happened under Aedana's attentive eye.
%spread_congress_followup_61%	Come on, Cupressa, it would have happened just the same.
%spread_congress_followup_62%	Now isn't the time to assign blame.
%spread_congress_followup_63%	We should focus on helping our sisters.
%spread_congress_followup_69%	I will happily aid you in this.
%spread_congress_followup_76%	So it's true... you summoned a Behemoth.
%spread_congress_followup_78%	I can't believe this, Fortuna...
%spread_congress_followup_80%	I did what I had to do to survive...
%spread_congress_followup_83%	So this is what Grethe was talking about...
%spread_congress_followup_85%	But this is a good thing!
%spread_congress_followup_86%	The Behemoth will unlock the path to true and complete understanding!
%spread_congress_followup_89%	Grethe!? How can you call this good!?
%spread_congress_followup_90%	Everyone is dying!!
%spread_congress_followup_93%	Oh, right... Why would Ábramar do something like this?
%spread_congress_followup_94%	From what I learned from Gaethëryan, revenge isn't something a Behemoth should be interested in...
%spread_congress_followup_95%	Have I been played, too?
%spread_congress_followup_97%	I'm sorry...
%spread_congress_followup_100%	So it's as the Arbitrage Office suspected...
%spread_congress_followup_103%	I can't believe you used me like that.
%spread_congress_followup_104%	I kept trying to help you and I was just being played.
%spread_congress_followup_106%	Come on, it's not like that.
%spread_congress_followup_109%	I had to regain my freedom or lose my mind.
%spread_congress_followup_110%	A thousand-year-long exile is too much. Aedana pushed me to this.
%spread_congress_followup_112%	...
%spread_congress_followup_115%	You did all this on your own. Don't blame Aedana.
%spread_congress_followup_116%	Now I understand why she was trying to keep you far away from our sisterhood.
%spread_congress_followup_119%	Hey, cut it out. My friend had the right to fight for her life.
%spread_congress_followup_123%	What you did was really dangerous, Fortuna...
%spread_congress_followup_124%	But I'm your friend, and I will help you.
%spread_congress_followup_126%	But first, let's focus on freeing our sisters, ok?
%spread_congress_followup_133%	This is war!
%spread_congress_followup_134%	The Arbitrage Office's days are numbered!
%spread_congress_followup_138%	Grab the Arbiter!
%spread_congress_followup_141%	I don't know what you're talking about!
%spread_congress_followup_142%	If what you're saying is true, they sent me to my own death here!
%spread_congress_followup_145%	That's true... so this is a plot from the higher-ups.
%spread_congress_followup_146%	We need to go after them.
%spread_congress_followup_150%	Calm down, Dahlia!
%spread_congress_followup_151%	Our priority right now should be to free our sisters!
%spread_congress_followup_159%	CUPRESSA! WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS!?
%spread_congress_followup_163%	I...
%spread_congress_followup_164%	This sisterhood is meaningless without Aedana.
%spread_congress_followup_165%	I've seen too many leaders come and go, and none of them achieved the perfection that Aedana did.
%spread_congress_followup_166%	The times ahead are dark.
%spread_congress_followup_167%	There's no Witch alive who can manage what Aedana's built.
%spread_congress_followup_168%	We are too powerful.
%spread_congress_followup_169%	We should all be scattered throughout the cosmos to let future covens form anew.
%spread_congress_followup_170%	It's time to reset our community.
%spread_congress_followup_174%	he he he...
%spread_congress_followup_175%	hehehahaha HAHAHAHAHAHA
%spread_congress_followup_176%	YOU WILL ALL BE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE COSMOS
%spread_congress_followup_177%	WHY SHOULD AEDANA BE THE ONLY SACRIFICE!?
%spread_congress_followup_178%	REJOICE! THE CYCLE OF LIFE!
%spread_congress_followup_183%	That moldy trunk is trying to kill us all!?
%spread_congress_followup_184%	She's not only abandoned the coven but is burning the house down behind her!?
%spread_congress_followup_189%	I can't believe it!
%spread_congress_followup_190%	Why did you do this, Cupressa?
%spread_congress_followup_192%	No use fretting about it.
%spread_congress_followup_193%	We should focus on freeing our sisters.
%spread_congress_followup_194%	We'll deal with Cupressa later.
%spread_congress_followup_201%	Oh, Fortuna, no...
%spread_congress_followup_204%	How is this your fault, idiot!?
%spread_congress_followup_206%	If anything, the architects who built this weak ass temple are to blame.
%spread_congress_followup_207%	Don't ever feel sorry for being the best.
%spread_congress_followup_211%	Fortuna...
%spread_congress_followup_213%	We'll fix everything together, alright?
%spread_congress_followup_216%	Now I understand why Aedana was trying to keep you far from our sisterhood.
%spread_congress_followup_217%	You are a hazard to this universe.
%spread_congress_followup_220%	Hey, shut up! You're not helping right now.
%spread_congress_followup_223%	You... Thank you...
%spread_congress_followup_224%	Let's fix this.
%chaos_laments_2_2%	I can't stand this anymore!
%chaos_laments_2_4%	Someone kill me!
%chaos_laments_2_6%	Get us out of here!
%chaos_debate_3%	OK! EVERYONE VOTE FOR ME!
%chaos_debate_5%	PICTURE ME AS YOUR LEADER!
%chaos_debate_7%	LET'S DISPEL THE FLAMES!
%chaos_debate_10%	Hey! Not so fast!
%chaos_debate_12%	This is just too important! It can't end like this!
%chaos_debate_14%	We must decide swiftly, but we must also decide wisely.
%chaos_debate_17%	...What do you propose, then?
%chaos_debate_22%	We cut through all the bullshit and sort everything out in front of the sisterhood.
%chaos_debate_26%	Ah... Mmm...
%chaos_debate_29%	Hey, gang! This is simple:
%chaos_debate_31%	You cut through all the bullshit and sort everything out in front of the sisterhood.
%chaos_debate_36%	HAH! I'm all for that! Fuck congress ceremony!
%chaos_debate_41%	This is highly unorthodox... but so is the situation.
%chaos_debate_42%	I agree to a straightforward conversation.
%chaos_debate_45%	SISTERS! FOLLOW ME! CHOOSE ME AS YOUR LEADER!
%chaos_debate_46%	MY BRANCHES EXTEND INTO OBLIVION!
%chaos_debate_48%	Ok, Cupressa is definitely out of this race.
%chaos_debate_52%	We'd better ignore her, yes.
%chaos_debate_56%	Very well. I'll begin.
%chaos_debate_57%	I'm going to be completely transparent since time is of the essence.
%chaos_debate_58%	You must all choose me as your leader, and the reasons are quite simple.
%chaos_debate_59%	You may or may not like my program, but even if you think it has room for improvement, it's the best option we've got right now.
%chaos_debate_60%	Dahlia's program is completely unrealistic and naive. Don't be swayed by her idealism. We can't function on charisma.
%chaos_debate_64%	HEY!
%chaos_debate_67%	Shut up. Let me talk.
%chaos_debate_71%	Then, Fortuna? Come on. We shouldn't even bother examining her program. She's been exiled for 200 years.
%chaos_debate_73%	She's completely oblivious as to the current reality of our coven.
%chaos_debate_76%	Hah, you wish, four eyes.
%chaos_debate_78%	Oof, bring it down a notch, Patrice.
%chaos_debate_81%	Hah, incredible.
%chaos_debate_87%	And Cupressa... For the sake of haste, can we stop pretending she's relevant?
%chaos_debate_89%	...
%chaos_debate_90%	Your discourse is riddled with fallacies, young Witch.
%chaos_debate_94%	CHILDISH TRIFLES IN THIS SACRED HOUSE.
%chaos_debate_95%	YOU TAINT THE HONOR OF EVERY WITCH BORN BEFORE YOU.
%chaos_debate_99%	...
%chaos_debate_101%	Open your eyes. I am the most sensible option.
%chaos_debate_102%	Acknowledge it and we can stop this madness.
%chaos_debate_105%	I'm not going to acknowledge shit.
%chaos_debate_106%	What kind of arguments are those?
%chaos_debate_108%	You're just tapping into our sisters' fear for a quick and easy win.
%chaos_debate_111%	Dahlia has a point there...
%chaos_debate_112%	Even if it was heavy-handed, Jasmine's not mistaken.
%chaos_debate_117%	Dahlia has a point there...
%chaos_debate_130%	Fortuna? Need I remind you whose side you're on?
%chaos_debate_132%	I'm sorry Jasmine. This goes beyond any loyalty. We must search for the best outcome. Together.
%chaos_debate_134%	Right now it's easy to justify a conservative stance because we're in the middle of a catastrophe.
%chaos_debate_135%	But this moment is too important. It may define the coming millennia.
%chaos_debate_136%	We mustn't cast our votes from a place of fear. What we need right now is...
%chaos_debate_139%	Strength.
%chaos_debate_140%	Hope.
%chaos_debate_141%	Ambition.
%chaos_debate_145%	Strength.
%chaos_debate_147%	What will allow us to overcome this and any future challenges?
%chaos_debate_150%	Well, that's easy: My program. Devouring Aedana and giving more autonomy to every Witch.
%chaos_debate_152%	If not that, at least not Dahlia's utopia.
%chaos_debate_155%	I...
%chaos_debate_156%	It's not a utopia! It's...
%chaos_debate_158%	Trust!
%chaos_debate_162%	That's too much of a gamble right now!
%chaos_debate_166%	Hope.
%chaos_debate_168%	This crisis is only proving that existence is fragile and ephemeral, even for us Witches.
%chaos_debate_170%	We must play unsafely. We must aim, hearts open, towards how we truly want to exist.
%chaos_debate_172%	Forget all of your fears.
%chaos_debate_173%	Hell, most of you may not even be here after the votes are cast.
%chaos_debate_175%	Just feel it! What kind of future do you wish for, for Witches around this universe?
%chaos_debate_178%	That was beautifully said, Fortuna!
%chaos_debate_181%	And that's exactly what I'm planning on bringing to you all, sisters!
%chaos_debate_182%	A complete upheaval of all power dynamics!
%chaos_debate_184%	Sisterhood! Coven! Those are all empty terms if we don't all stand as equals!
%chaos_debate_187%	Not so fast!
%chaos_debate_188%	That is nothing but pure demagoguery! You cannot appropriate the words coven and sisterhood like that!
%chaos_debate_190%	Communities need leadership and wisdom! Elders have always taken care of the young!
%chaos_debate_192%	You are painting those traditions as a power inequality, but it's way more simple than that!
%chaos_debate_195%	It's love!
%chaos_debate_196%	In its most pure and disinterested form.
%chaos_debate_197%	Elders watching over the future generations... paving the way, teaching, guiding!
%chaos_debate_201%	Ambition.
%chaos_debate_203%	What do we want to achieve?
%chaos_debate_204%	We're not just here to survive.
%chaos_debate_205%	We left that behind when we transcended mortality.
%chaos_debate_207%	Envision your ideal coven and cast your vote accordingly!
%chaos_debate_210%	That is so true! Thanks for reminding me what we're here for, Fortuna!
%chaos_debate_213%	Let's devour Aedana, not to survive, but to take hold of the reins of our fate!
%chaos_debate_216%	Hah, you are taking it for granted that what our sisters want is power!
%chaos_debate_218%	I say an ideal coven is one built on trust! A community that is diverse and welcoming!
%chaos_debate_221%	You say that as if you're implying my program isn't built on trust.
%chaos_debate_222%	A community that aims to be welcoming must first be stable!
%chaos_debate_224%	My ambition is to create a prosperous coven to guide and protect old and future Witches alike!
%chaos_debate_228%	We can do exactly that without the need to hoard all that power!
%chaos_debate_233%	Even if it was heavy-handed, Jasmine's not mistaken.
%chaos_debate_246%	Fortuna...? You're on my team... remember?
%chaos_debate_248%	I'm sorry, Dahlia. This goes beyond any loyalty. We must search for the best outcome. Together.
%chaos_debate_250%	We find ourselves in an unprecedented situation.
%chaos_debate_251%	We cannot wield the same arguments we've been using during the campaign.
%chaos_debate_252%	It's not a matter of which political system benefits us the most.
%chaos_debate_253%	Whoever wants to become the leader must make a case for why they are the most appropriate choice for the survival of our coven.
%chaos_debate_254%	And to me, there's a critical factor in keeping our community alive:
%chaos_debate_257%	Witches.
%chaos_debate_258%	Culture. Our traditions.
%chaos_debate_259%	Power. Divinity.
%chaos_debate_263%	Witches.
%chaos_debate_264%	That's what this is all about! A coven is made of Witches!
%chaos_debate_265%	A sisterhood is but the sum of its sisters!
%chaos_debate_270%	What are you doing, Fortuna!?
%chaos_debate_271%	This argument only benefits Dahlia!
%chaos_debate_273%	I'm well past caring about the race at this point.
%chaos_debate_277%	Oooh! That's an unexpected turn!
%chaos_debate_278%	Well played, Fortuna!
%chaos_debate_281%	If we are forced to lose so many sisters today, our highest priority should be rebuilding a community.
%chaos_debate_284%	Exactly!
%chaos_debate_295%	Argh... You made a bloody good point there...
%chaos_debate_296%	But still...
%chaos_debate_298%	It's somewhat reductionist.
%chaos_debate_299%	There are other ways of increasing our numbers.
%chaos_debate_301%	We can't go along with Dahlia's naive horizontalism just for the sake of speeding up our recovery.
%chaos_debate_304%	We can't go along with Dahlia's naive horizontalism or your weird middle ground just for the sake of speeding up our recovery.
%chaos_debate_306%	In the long run, what will matter is the set of rules and mechanisms we decide to live by.
%chaos_debate_308%	That's what we're deciding here today.
%chaos_debate_312%	Culture. Our traditions.
%chaos_debate_313%	That's the DNA of a community.
%chaos_debate_314%	People and context come and go... the times come and go...
%chaos_debate_315%	What makes this coven what it is is the culture.
%chaos_debate_320%	That was beautifully said, Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_321%	And I am the safekeeper of both our history and traditions.
%chaos_debate_323%	I will gladly ensure we stay true to our founding values while we rebuild our sisterhood.
%chaos_debate_325%	And your contribution is going to prove invaluable, Cupressa.
%chaos_debate_327%	But we can have culture, with you as our counselor, and a revised, updated program to increase our chances at prosperity.
%chaos_debate_329%	However...
%chaos_debate_331%	No, Cupressa. Keeping Aedana's corpse intact isn't going to prove useful at all.
%chaos_debate_333%	We need the power.
%chaos_debate_336%	Ahem. Or to scatter her to nurture our sisterhood with more Witches after this major blow to our numbers.
%chaos_debate_338%	...
%chaos_debate_342%	THE FORTUNE SNIFFER HAS BEEN BLESSED BY THE REASON OF THE FIRST VOICE.
%chaos_debate_343%	HISTORY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE FUTURE. HISTORY IS ALWAYS TRUE.
%chaos_debate_345%	THE FUTURE IS A LIE. REJECT FUTURISM. EMBRACE TRADITION.
%chaos_debate_349%	Seriously? That bullshit earned her some votes?
%chaos_debate_352%	Have some compassion, our sisters are trapped inside an everlasting magical explosion.
%chaos_debate_353%	It's only natural for their judgment to be clouded or impulsive.
%chaos_debate_356%	Yes... you're right.
%chaos_debate_357%	Anyway, to your point, Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_358%	Tradition is important, yes... but culture is made up of progress and change too.
%chaos_debate_360%	This catastrophe is now part of our culture, and the change it brings will shape what's ahead.
%chaos_debate_363%	That's why we should treat this transition with care.
%chaos_debate_364%	We can't blow up the foundations along with the sisterhood, Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_366%	My program offers the best compromise between safekeeping our culture and increasing our chances at prosperity.
%chaos_debate_369%	I disagree.
%chaos_debate_372%	Having been shaken to our core, this is precisely the time to completely reform the coven's systems.
%chaos_debate_376%	Power. Divinity.
%chaos_debate_377%	Let's face it. We're not talking about how to manage a community anymore.
%chaos_debate_378%	We're dealing with an extinction-level event.
%chaos_debate_379%	We need unprecedented levels of power if we ever hope to bring back the glory days.
%chaos_debate_383%	Thank you!
%chaos_debate_384%	That's why we should prioritize devouring Aedana.
%chaos_debate_385%	The situation has changed, we need the power to rebuild!
%chaos_debate_392%	I say the way to go is either your program or mine, Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_396%	NO!
%chaos_debate_397%	Are you two blind!? WE'VE LOST PEOPLE!
%chaos_debate_400%	WE NEED PEOPLE!
%chaos_debate_401%	If we scatter Aedana's remains, many more Witches will ascend!
%chaos_debate_404%	...And I can bring that to the table.
%chaos_debate_405%	Allow me to devour Aedana all by myself.
%chaos_debate_407%	My intimate relationship with fate, fueled by Aedana's vast magic power will allow us to submit this very cosmos to our will!
%chaos_debate_409%	We can create a utopia!
%chaos_debate_412%	Oh, whoa, whoa, easy there, Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_415%	Aren't we going to stop to consider the implications of turning one of our sisters into a god?
%chaos_debate_420%	That's right! What we need right now is unity! Not to increase the power gap between sisters!
%chaos_debate_423%	Well said, Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_424%	I'm sure we would regret doing something so drastic at a moment like this.
%chaos_debate_426%	Let's remain cautious and work within what we know has worked for all these millennia!
%chaos_debate_429%	Thanks, Jasmine, but sticking to the old ways wasn't exactly my point here.
%chaos_laments_3_2%	What are you doing!?
%chaos_laments_3_4%	Decide already! Make it stop!!!
%chaos_laments_3_6%	Fight each other for all I care!
%chaos_debate_2_5%	Mmm... I guess we're not doing a great job of cutting through all the bullshit.
%chaos_debate_2_8%	It's starting to feel like the opposite.
%chaos_debate_2_9%	...Mmm. I know!
%chaos_debate_2_11%	Aren't we friends?
%chaos_debate_2_12%	Can't we come to an agreement? We need to offer our suffering sisters a way out already.
%chaos_debate_2_17%	Girls... you're not doing a great job of cutting through all the bullshit.
%chaos_debate_2_19%	It's starting to feel like the opposite.
%chaos_debate_2_21%	You're friends, aren't you?
%chaos_debate_2_22%	Come to an agreement and offer our suffering sisters a way out already.
%chaos_debate_2_25%	That's easier said than done...
%chaos_debate_2_26%	None of us wants to relinquish her view.
%chaos_debate_2_27%	...And not because we're power-hungry, exactly.
%chaos_debate_2_28%	It moves me... the certainty of how wholeheartedly we all love our coven that we can't simply leave its future up to chance.
%chaos_debate_2_30%	How about we change our approach:
%chaos_debate_2_33%	Each of us says who she'd rather have as a leader, not including herself.
%chaos_debate_2_34%	A duel. May the most powerful lead.
%chaos_debate_2_35%	(Reveal dirt.) During the campaign I discovered some worrying things...
%chaos_debate_2_36%	This is all pointless. I already saw the winner in my cards.
%chaos_debate_2_37%	I'll draw a card to discover once and for all who'll lead.
%chaos_debate_2_42%	Each of us says who she'd rather have as a leader, not including herself.
%chaos_debate_2_45%	Mmm... ok?
%chaos_debate_2_46%	What'll be the point?
%chaos_debate_2_48%	We've been at each other's throats for the whole campaign.
%chaos_debate_2_49%	Let's change gears and discuss our virtues.
%chaos_debate_2_52%	I like it! I can respect that!
%chaos_debate_2_57%	I don't really see the point, but I'll do anything to break this impasse.
%chaos_debate_2_60%	Oh, yeah? I guess your case is easy. You would vote for me, right?
%chaos_debate_2_62%	My program is the most similar to yours.
%chaos_debate_2_65%	I guess so. Not that I'm passionate about it.
%chaos_debate_2_66%	You are simply the candidate I would distrust the least with our coven's traditions.
%chaos_debate_2_70%	That's flattering, heh...
%chaos_debate_2_72%	A point for me, nonetheless.
%chaos_debate_2_78%	You are mistaken. My first choice would be Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_2_81%	Fortuna!? Why? You know our visions align way better!
%chaos_debate_2_83%	I have my reasons.
%chaos_debate_2_85%	Fortuna is the human Witch I'd rather have at the helm.
%chaos_debate_2_88%	Haha, what did you do to capture this trunk's heart?
%chaos_debate_2_90%	What can I say? I'm a good candidate.
%chaos_debate_2_95%	I'm inclined to say Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_2_98%	Fortuna!? Why? You know our visions align way better!
%chaos_debate_2_100%	But the Truth Chili is compelling me to tell the whole truth.
%chaos_debate_2_102%	Oh...
%chaos_debate_2_104%	Fortuna discovered a secret of mine and blackmailed me with disclosing it to the whole coven if I didn't say she was my favorite candidate.
%chaos_debate_2_108%	Oh my gosh! That's diabolical, Fortuna!
%chaos_debate_2_111%	You've gone too far with this one.
%chaos_debate_2_112%	And here I was thinking we were all having a healthy competition.
%chaos_debate_2_113%	I don't know about you all, but I can't trust a liar to lead our coven.
%chaos_debate_2_116%	Me neither...
%chaos_debate_2_117%	I guess it's between you and me now.
%chaos_debate_2_119%	Wait... I'm so sorry.
%chaos_debate_2_120%	I... that was a desperate measure. I understand. I'm ashamed.
%chaos_debate_2_121%	But everything else we've built and prepared for this coven has been devised with the best intentions.
%chaos_debate_2_124%	...
%chaos_debate_2_126%	Whatever. It's not up to us to forgive you.
%chaos_debate_2_127%	Our sisters will vote accordingly.
%chaos_debate_2_128%	...What now?
%chaos_debate_2_132%	I WOULD VOTE DAHLIA, BECAUSE I'D RATHER HAVE THIS COVEN COMPLETELY DESTROYED THAN BECOME A SHADOW OF ITSELF.
%chaos_debate_2_135%	Whoa, what was that just now, trunk?
%chaos_debate_2_137%	GET RID OF AEDANA, GET RID OF ANY SYSTEM OF POWER, REFERENDUM IS THE UTTER DISSOLUTION OF STRUCTURE.
%chaos_debate_2_140%	Does that count as a vote in favor or against?
%chaos_debate_2_143%	I don't know, I tuned her out ages ago.
%chaos_debate_2_144%	Anyway, let's do it.
%chaos_debate_2_148%	Mmm... I'm starting to feel like this wasn't a good idea.
%chaos_debate_2_152%	Who would you vote for, Dahlia?
%chaos_debate_2_155%	I'd vote for you, Jasmine. Obviously.
%chaos_debate_2_156%	And you?
%chaos_debate_2_162%	I...
%chaos_debate_2_163%	I'd pick Cupressa.
%chaos_debate_2_166%	WHAT!?
%chaos_debate_2_168%	You've always been the most sensible of the lot, Jasmine.
%chaos_debate_2_169%	Thank you.
%chaos_debate_2_172%	How could you pick this decaying log over me!?
%chaos_debate_2_175%	I'm sorry... your program is just too radical, Dahlia...
%chaos_debate_2_178%	This is incredible.
%chaos_debate_2_179%	Whatever.
%chaos_debate_2_180%	Now what?
%chaos_debate_2_185%	I'd vote for you, too, Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_2_188%	Well, wasn't this a waste of time!
%chaos_debate_2_190%	Ugh... I'm so sorry.
%chaos_debate_2_195%	I'm sorry, Jas, but I'd go with Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_2_198%	Don't worry, I'd choose Fortuna too, to be frank.
%chaos_debate_2_201%	Wait! You tricked us into saying you're our favorite candidate!
%chaos_debate_2_203%	No. No. I swear. I wanted to know your genuine opinion.
%chaos_debate_2_204%	I'm humbled you both would have me as the next leader.
%chaos_debate_2_207%	Well, it doesn't matter if it was a trick or not, Jasmine.
%chaos_debate_2_208%	It is what it is. We both chose her.
%chaos_debate_2_211%	That's true...
%chaos_debate_2_213%	Who's your favorite candidate, though, Fortuna?
%chaos_debate_2_216%	Jasmine.
%chaos_debate_2_217%	Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_2_218%	Not Cupressa, that's for sure.
%chaos_debate_2_223%	Not Cupressa, that's for sure.
%chaos_debate_2_226%	Yeah, no shit.
%chaos_debate_2_227%	Come on, who?
%chaos_debate_2_230%	Jasmine.
%chaos_debate_2_231%	Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_2_236%	I like Jasmine's program better.
%chaos_debate_2_239%	Yay! It makes me so happy to hear it!
%chaos_debate_2_242%	Bummer... but I understand.
%chaos_debate_2_243%	...What do we do now?
%chaos_debate_2_248%	I like Dahlia's program better.
%chaos_debate_2_251%	Alright! Thank you!
%chaos_debate_2_254%	Of course you do...
%chaos_debate_2_255%	Ahem... What do we do now?
%chaos_debate_2_260%	A duel. May the most powerful lead.
%chaos_debate_2_263%	NOW WE'RE TALKING!
%chaos_debate_2_265%	HERE I AM! FIGHT ME ALL AT THE SAME TIME!
%chaos_debate_2_271%	This is barbaric, and by no measure a way to gauge the aptitude of a leader.
%chaos_debate_2_275%	I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT FOR ALL MY LIFE.
%chaos_debate_2_276%	I PROPOSE WE DUEL EACH OTHER IN A STARING CONTEST.
%chaos_debate_2_279%	PFFT, what!?
%chaos_debate_2_280%	You don't even have working eyes, Cupressa!
%chaos_debate_2_283%	Please, don't engage with her, she's clearly unwell. Plus...
%chaos_debate_2_287%	A DUEL!?
%chaos_debate_2_289%	Have you lost your mind, Fortuna?
%chaos_debate_2_291%	I don't know, I'm really desperate at this point.
%chaos_debate_2_292%	I can't bear hearing all those screams...
%chaos_debate_2_295%	That doesn't mean we're going to fight each other, please!
%chaos_debate_2_298%	I've always wanted to duke it out with you two someday.
%chaos_debate_2_299%	Might as well do it in front of this epic scene!
%chaos_debate_2_302%	No! I refuse! Not now, not ever!
%chaos_debate_2_304%	Mmm... That was a bad idea, I'm sorry...
%chaos_debate_2_308%	During the campaign I discovered some worrying things...
%chaos_debate_2_310%	I'm sorry, but I believe I should disclose everything before we cast any votes.
%chaos_debate_2_313%	So, about what I found...
%chaos_debate_2_316%	Cupressa feeds on failed novices to remain immortal.
%chaos_debate_2_317%	Jasmine secretly drugged other Witches to increase the coven's performance.
%chaos_debate_2_318%	Dahlia supplied the criminal Witches responsible for the Nightmare Uprising.
%chaos_debate_2_319%	Cupressa removed memories from her branches to cover for Aedana.
%chaos_debate_2_320%	That's everything I found.
%chaos_debate_2_324%	Cupressa feeds on failed novices to remain immortal.
%chaos_debate_2_327%	WHAT!?
%chaos_debate_2_330%	That's just a joke we use to haze newcomers, Fortuna!
%chaos_debate_2_333%	It's heartwarming how naive you can be sometimes, my friend.
%chaos_debate_2_336%	Huh... Haha, I knew it too...
%chaos_debate_2_337%	I was just messing around...
%chaos_debate_2_341%	Sure, darling.
%chaos_debate_2_342%	Anything else that you wanted to... "disclose?"
%chaos_debate_2_347%	Sure, partner.
%chaos_debate_2_348%	Anything else that you wanted to... "disclose?"
%chaos_debate_2_352%	Jasmine secretly drugged other Witches to increase the coven's performance.
%chaos_debate_2_355%	...!
%chaos_debate_2_357%	Presumably with the best of intentions, Jasmine snuck some performance enhancers into her mixtures.
%chaos_debate_2_358%	She's been spiking the infusions she provides to the coven in an attempt to keep Aedana happy.
%chaos_debate_2_359%	It was all done with the purpose of helping everyone fulfill their quarterly controls, but still, to do so without the consent of her sisters...
%chaos_debate_2_363%	But I already apologized for all that!
%chaos_debate_2_364%	I made peace with the Witches concerned, and Aedana was aware of it too!
%chaos_debate_2_366%	I'm sure... but it still speaks to the lines you would cross...
%chaos_debate_2_367%	It's important to bear that in mind when picking a new leader.
%chaos_debate_2_370%	...
%chaos_debate_2_371%	I learned my lesson.
%chaos_debate_2_372%	But very well. I hope you're proud of digging through your sisters' dirt.
%chaos_debate_2_374%	I'm just doing my duty.
%chaos_debate_2_378%	Dahlia supplied the criminal Witches responsible for the Nightmare Uprising.
%chaos_debate_2_381%	...!
%chaos_debate_2_383%	Remember when some Daemon tamers got bold and tried to control the Arbitrage Office by raiding their nightmares?
%chaos_debate_2_384%	Well, it was Dahlia supplying them with the necessary tools and weapons.
%chaos_debate_2_387%	I'm a Daggersmith! I craft weapons for anyone who commissions me!
%chaos_debate_2_389%	Exactly.
%chaos_debate_2_390%	You should have drawn a line there.
%chaos_debate_2_393%	But I didn't know they were planning to raid the Arbitrage Office!
%chaos_debate_2_395%	Then it's your judgment that's impaired.
%chaos_debate_2_397%	Either way, it's a critical flaw for a leader, in my opinion.
%chaos_debate_2_400%	FORTUNA! This isn't fair!!
%chaos_debate_2_402%	I'm truly sorry. But our sisters have the right to know.
%chaos_debate_2_405%	...
%chaos_debate_2_406%	I won't forget this.
%chaos_debate_2_410%	Cupressa removed memories from her branches to cover for Aedana.
%chaos_debate_2_411%	You see, Cupressa has this perfect memory, storing all events inside her tree rings, knots and branches.
%chaos_debate_2_412%	Well, apparently, during Aedana's mandate, some... "developments," had to be edited out of existence.
%chaos_debate_2_413%	And that included literally trimming some of Cupressa's branches, destroying many years of records just to cover up Aedana's dealings.
%chaos_debate_2_418%	...
%chaos_debate_2_419%	I don't have any recollection of that.
%chaos_debate_2_421%	Exactly.
%chaos_debate_2_423%	Well I can't defend myself against something I'm not aware of.
%chaos_debate_2_425%	That's pretty convenient, right?
%chaos_debate_2_427%	Could you tell me what was lost? What we were hiding?
%chaos_debate_2_429%	Hmm... Not really. All records from the incidents have been destroyed.
%chaos_debate_2_431%	...
%chaos_debate_2_433%	...
%chaos_debate_2_434%	Ok, this didn't go as I expected.
%chaos_debate_2_438%	BUT WAS IT ONLY THE RECORDS THAT WERE CUT?
%chaos_debate_2_439%	OR WAS IT THE VERY FABRIC OF REALITY RIPPED OUT OF EXISTENCE?
%chaos_debate_2_440%	BECAUSE THE UNPERCEIVED FALLS INTO THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE NON EXISTENT.
%chaos_debate_2_441%	HENCE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS UNTRUE.
%chaos_debate_2_443%	Mmm... Fortuna, I don't think we need to dunk on Cupressa anymore.
%chaos_debate_2_444%	She pretty much lost this race at the same time as her marbles.
%chaos_debate_2_446%	Yeah, you're right, sorry...
%chaos_debate_2_449%	Well, good to know. Thanks for sharing that.
%chaos_debate_2_450%	But Cupressa isn't part of this race anymore, so...
%chaos_debate_2_452%	Yeah, mmm, sorry...
%chaos_debate_2_459%	Anyway, that's everything I found.
%chaos_debate_2_462%	...You're lucky to have spent two centuries trapped in your home.
%chaos_debate_2_463%	That's the best way of staying clean, isn't it?
%chaos_debate_2_467%	...You're lucky to have spent two centuries trapped in your home.
%chaos_debate_2_468%	No way of digging up any dirt on you that way.
%chaos_debate_2_471%	Oh, yeah, I've been so lucky.
%chaos_debate_2_472%	...
%chaos_debate_2_475%	I see how dissing us may put you ahead, but I don't know if we're any closer to coming to an agreement.
%chaos_debate_2_478%	I see how dissing us may put you ahead, but I don't know if we're any closer to coming to an agreement.
%chaos_debate_2_482%	(Mmm... I've still got more dirt. Should I use it?)
%chaos_debate_2_489%	You bet you did.
%chaos_debate_2_490%	I'm sincerely disappointed in your lack of ethics.
%chaos_debate_2_492%	Your little spies have been all over the place throughout the whole race.
%chaos_debate_2_493%	I object.
%chaos_debate_2_494%	I won't let you spill a single drop of poison on this debate.
%chaos_debate_2_498%	It's sad. Really.
%chaos_debate_2_499%	Why would you even bring that up at this moment?
%chaos_debate_2_501%	We caught you red handed, Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_2_503%	But still... What I discovered...
%chaos_debate_2_506%	No one cares. Can it.
%chaos_debate_2_509%	Ok... I understand.
%chaos_debate_2_514%	Let it go, Fortuna. Dahlia has the right to be this pissed.
%chaos_debate_2_515%	We screwed up with that.
%chaos_debate_2_520%	You bet you did.
%chaos_debate_2_521%	I'm sincerely disappointed in your lack of ethics.
%chaos_debate_2_523%	Your little spies have been all over the place throughout the whole race.
%chaos_debate_2_524%	I object.
%chaos_debate_2_525%	I won't let you spill a single drop of poison on this debate.
%chaos_debate_2_527%	But still... What I discovered...
%chaos_debate_2_530%	Let it go, Fortuna. Jasmine has the right to be this pissed.
%chaos_debate_2_531%	We screwed up with that.
%chaos_debate_2_536%	This is all pointless. I already saw the winner in my cards.
%chaos_debate_2_540%	What!?
%chaos_debate_2_541%	When were you planning on telling us?
%chaos_debate_2_544%	Who's going to be the new leader, then!?
%chaos_debate_2_553%	Cupressa...
%chaos_debate_2_556%	Impossible!
%chaos_debate_2_558%	And not only that, I read it'll mean dark times for the coven.
%chaos_debate_2_561%	We can't allow that!
%chaos_debate_2_566%	Dark times as per your interpretation, Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_2_568%	I'm glad to know I'll have the chance to set the coven on the right path.
%chaos_debate_2_572%	THE WILL OF THE GOLDEN WHISPERS.
%chaos_debate_2_573%	IT IS ONLY WHEN SUN DEPRIVED THAT THE MAGIC MYCELIUM MAY ARISE.
%chaos_debate_2_575%	FOLLOW ME INTO THE DARKNESS. I WILL LEAD YOU TO THE OTHER SIDE.
%chaos_debate_2_579%	Oh no!
%chaos_debate_2_582%	We need to do something!
%chaos_debate_2_583%	Can't we... change this in any way, Fortuna?
%chaos_debate_2_585%	We can try...
%chaos_debate_2_586%	But you know that no prediction of mine has ever failed to happen.
%chaos_debate_2_587%	Still, I guess trying is the only thing we have left.
%chaos_debate_2_590%	We can't surrender! It'd be a self-fulfilling prophecy otherwise!
%chaos_debate_2_591%	There's always a first time for everything, right?
%chaos_debate_2_592%	Let's make your prediction fail!
%chaos_debate_2_594%	Hah... that's some weird encouragement, but sure.
%chaos_debate_2_597%	Plus Cupressa isn't even here to begin with!
%chaos_debate_2_600%	Technically, we can still vote for her even if she's absent.
%chaos_debate_2_603%	No! Don't vote for her! I didn't mean it like that!
%chaos_debate_2_609%	Me.
%chaos_debate_2_612%	No! Come on! That's cheating!!
%chaos_debate_2_615%	You??
%chaos_debate_2_618%	I know it's precognition... but it does feel wrong that you knew you were gonna win all along.
%chaos_debate_2_619%	Why did we bother doing the whole campaign and everything?
%chaos_debate_2_622%	I demand a rematch!
%chaos_debate_2_624%	A rematch? About what? The card reading?
%chaos_debate_2_627%	Yes! Read the cards again!
%chaos_debate_2_629%	It doesn't work like that...
%chaos_debate_2_632%	Well I refuse to accept that reading.
%chaos_debate_2_633%	You could have been biased by your own wishful thinking.
%chaos_debate_2_635%	We need to fight this to the very end, Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_2_639%	Yes! Let's fight for our future!
%chaos_debate_2_641%	Hey, you're making me sound like the villain here...
%chaos_debate_2_644%	We can't give up, Fortuna. Please understand that.
%chaos_debate_2_650%	Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_2_653%	YES!
%chaos_debate_2_655%	Yeeeeeeeees!!!!
%chaos_debate_2_656%	I knew it!
%chaos_debate_2_659%	What!?
%chaos_debate_2_661%	I can't accept this!!
%chaos_debate_2_663%	Just like that? You drew a card and we must all follow your reading blindly?
%chaos_debate_2_665%	You can try to fight it, of course...
%chaos_debate_2_666%	But you know that no prediction of mine has ever failed to happen.
%chaos_debate_2_670%	I refuse.
%chaos_debate_2_672%	I don't care.
%chaos_debate_2_675%	I won't deny you your fighting chance, of course.
%chaos_debate_2_676%	But it's going to be almost impossible to beat both fate and me.
%chaos_debate_2_680%	Just you wait. Let's keep this debate going.
%chaos_debate_2_686%	Jasmine.
%chaos_debate_2_689%	Me!?
%chaos_debate_2_691%	That's wonderful! Thank you, everyone!
%chaos_debate_2_694%	Hey, hey, hey!!!
%chaos_debate_2_695%	That's just, like... a prediction!
%chaos_debate_2_698%	I can still fight this, right!?
%chaos_debate_2_700%	You can try to fight it, of course...
%chaos_debate_2_701%	But you know that no prediction of mine has ever failed to happen.
%chaos_debate_2_704%	Well, there's a first time for everything!
%chaos_debate_2_706%	Bring it on, Jasmine!
%chaos_debate_2_709%	Ah, so intense!
%chaos_debate_2_711%	It's alright, Dahlia, I'll take care of everyone!
%chaos_debate_2_712%	Let's get this over with already and free our sisters!
%chaos_debate_2_716%	No! I refuse!
%chaos_debate_2_718%	I don't care if it's fate or all the gods in this cosmos!
%chaos_debate_2_720%	I'll never surrender!
%chaos_debate_2_723%	Oh... ok, you're welcome to try...
%chaos_debate_2_729%	You mean the one you wrote, you cheater!
%chaos_debate_2_732%	What, so we've been wasting our time like fools?
%chaos_debate_2_734%	I'm sorry...
%chaos_debate_2_737%	So, who's it going to be? Come on, spit it out.
%chaos_debate_2_746%	Cupressa...
%chaos_debate_2_749%	WHY!?
%chaos_debate_2_751%	And not only that... it'll mean dark times for the coven.
%chaos_debate_2_754%	Why would you write that!? We can't allow that!
%chaos_debate_2_759%	Dark times as per your interpretation, Fortuna.
%chaos_debate_2_761%	I'm glad to know I'll have the chance to set the coven on the right path.
%chaos_debate_2_765%	THE WILL OF THE GOLDEN WHISPERS.
%chaos_debate_2_766%	IT IS ONLY WHEN SUN DEPRIVED THAT THE MAGIC MYCELIUM MAY ARISE.
%chaos_debate_2_768%	FOLLOW ME INTO THE DARKNESS. I WILL LEAD YOU TO THE OTHER SIDE.
%chaos_debate_2_772%	Oh no!
%chaos_debate_2_775%	We need to do something!
%chaos_debate_2_776%	Can't we... change this in any way, Fortuna?
%chaos_debate_2_778%	We can try...
%chaos_debate_2_779%	But you know that no prediction of mine has ever failed to happen.
%chaos_debate_2_780%	And I can't... rewrite things.
%chaos_debate_2_781%	But trying is the only thing we have left.
%chaos_debate_2_784%	We can't surrender! It'd be a self-fulfilling prophecy otherwise!
%chaos_debate_2_785%	There's always a first time for everything, right?
%chaos_debate_2_786%	Let's make your prediction fail!
%chaos_debate_2_788%	Hah... that's some weird encouragement, but sure.
%chaos_debate_2_791%	Plus Cupressa isn't even here to begin with!
%chaos_debate_2_794%	Technically, we can still vote for her even if she's absent.
%chaos_debate_2_797%	No! Don't vote for her! I didn't mean it like that!
%chaos_debate_2_803%	Me.
%chaos_debate_2_806%	Of course you'd write yourself as the new leader!
%chaos_debate_2_809%	Fortuna, why??
%chaos_debate_2_812%	Doesn't it feel wrong to you to know you were going to win all along?
%chaos_debate_2_813%	Why did we bother doing the whole campaign and everything?
%chaos_debate_2_816%	I demand a rematch!
%chaos_debate_2_818%	A rematch? About what? The card reading?
%chaos_debate_2_821%	Yes! Read the cards again!
%chaos_debate_2_823%	It doesn't work like that...
%chaos_debate_2_826%	Well I refuse to accept that reading.
%chaos_debate_2_828%	We need to fight this to the very end, Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_2_832%	Yes! Let's fight for our future!
%chaos_debate_2_834%	Hey, you're making me sound like the villain here...
%chaos_debate_2_837%	We can't give up, Fortuna. Please understand that.
%chaos_debate_2_843%	Dahlia.
%chaos_debate_2_846%	YES!
%chaos_debate_2_848%	Yeeeeeeeees!!!!
%chaos_debate_2_849%	THANK YOU!
%chaos_debate_2_852%	What!?
%chaos_debate_2_854%	I can't accept this!!
%chaos_debate_2_856%	Just like that? You drew a card and we must all follow your reading blindly?
%chaos_debate_2_858%	You can try to fight it, of course...
%chaos_debate_2_859%	But you know that no prediction of mine has ever failed to happen.
%chaos_debate_2_863%	I refuse.
%chaos_debate_2_865%	I don't care.
%chaos_debate_2_868%	I won't deny you your fighting chance, Jasmine, of course.
%chaos_debate_2_869%	But it's going to be almost impossible to beat both fate and me.
%chaos_debate_2_873%	Just you wait. Let's keep this debate going.
%chaos_debate_2_879%	Jasmine.
%chaos_debate_2_882%	Me!?
%chaos_debate_2_884%	Well, that's wonderful! Thank you!
%chaos_debate_2_887%	Hey, hey, hey!!!
%chaos_debate_2_889%	What the hell!?
%chaos_debate_2_891%	I can still fight this, right!?
%chaos_debate_2_893%	You can try to fight it, of course...
%chaos_debate_2_894%	But you know that no prediction of mine has ever failed to happen.
%chaos_debate_2_897%	Well, there's a first time for everything!
%chaos_debate_2_899%	Bring it on, Jasmine!
%chaos_debate_2_902%	Ah, so intense!
%chaos_debate_2_904%	It's alright, Dahlia, I'll take care of everyone!
%chaos_debate_2_905%	Let's get this over with already and free our sisters!
%chaos_debate_2_909%	No! I refuse!
%chaos_debate_2_911%	I don't care if fate has been written already or if I must face all the gods in this cosmos!
%chaos_debate_2_913%	I'll never surrender!
%chaos_debate_2_916%	Oh... ok, you're welcome to try...
%chaos_debate_2_921%	I'll draw a card to discover once and for all who'll lead.
%chaos_debate_2_927%	I wouldn't be against it.
%chaos_debate_2_928%	Oracles have always played a major role when it comes to steering the coven's fate.
%chaos_debate_2_932%	IT'S WITHIN THE WILL OF THE GODS THAT WE'LL FIND THE STONES TO PAVE OUR NEW ROADS.
%chaos_debate_2_933%	TELL ME, HANDLER OF THE CARDS, WHERE SHALL I SPREAD OUR ROOTS!?
%chaos_debate_2_937%	Oh, mmm... are you sure?
%chaos_debate_2_938%	It doesn't feel right after all this work to leave it all up to chance.
%chaos_debate_2_941%	Yeah... it feels like a coin toss.
%chaos_debate_2_942%	Not only that... you're the dealer here. Doesn't that give you a bit of an advantage?
%chaos_debate_2_944%	Mmm... It's not exactly up to chance, but... I understand how you feel.
%chaos_debate_2_947%	Come on, I'm sure there must be another way of coming to an agreement.
%chaos_debate_2_952%	Whoa, now, hold your horses!
%chaos_debate_2_953%	Didn't you confess that what you do is writing the future?
%chaos_debate_2_956%	I'm not going to let you write yourself up as the winner!
%chaos_debate_2_959%	I'm not going to let you write Jasmine up as the winner!
%chaos_debate_2_962%	It wouldn't be fair to write us up as the winners!
%chaos_debate_2_966%	I'm with Dahlia here, this doesn't feel right.
%chaos_debate_2_967%	Your whole deal feels... complicated.
%chaos_debate_2_968%	We're going to have to deal with your powers right away after we're done with congress.
%chaos_debate_2_970%	Uh... Ok.
%chaos_debate_2_971%	I just wanted to speed things up...
%chaos_debate_2_978%	Argh... There must be something that we can do to break out of this loop.
%chaos_debate_2_981%	Each of us says who she'd rather have as a leader, other than herself.
%chaos_debate_2_982%	A duel. May the most powerful lead.
%chaos_debate_2_983%	(Reveal dirt.) During the campaign I discovered some worrying things...
%chaos_debate_2_984%	This is all pointless. I already saw the winner in my cards.
%chaos_debate_2_985%	I'll draw a card to discover once and for all who'll lead.
%chaos_laments_4_2%	AAAAARRRGH!!
%chaos_laments_4_4%	I CAN'T TAKE IT!!
%chaos_laments_4_6%	I DON'T CARE WHO LEADS ANYMORE.
%chaos_hopeless_4%	We're not getting anywhere...
%chaos_hopeless_5%	This is all pointless...
%chaos_hopeless_8%	We're fighting about who's going to rule over the ashes of our sisters.
%chaos_hopeless_11%	Shit, Fortuna, why did you have to predict the fall of our coven...
%chaos_hopeless_14%	This...
%chaos_hopeless_16%	This is all your fault.
%chaos_hopeless_19%	...My fault?
%chaos_hopeless_20%	That's... that's more accurate than you think.
%chaos_hopeless_23%	What? Did you...?
%chaos_hopeless_25%	Not long ago I discovered that my powers aren't really fortune telling.
%chaos_hopeless_26%	That what I do with my cards is not reading the future but... writing it.
%chaos_hopeless_29%	...Writing it?
%chaos_hopeless_31%	I have the power to alter the past and the future.
%chaos_hopeless_34%	The past too!? How does that work?
%chaos_hopeless_36%	Well... I don't think it's the time to get into that, but... the thing is that you're right to blame me.
%chaos_hopeless_37%	I wrote the destruction of the coven... I caused it.
%chaos_hopeless_40%	That's... not possible!
%chaos_hopeless_42%	Aedana was aware of my true talents. That's why she sent me to exile and deprived me of my deck.
%chaos_hopeless_46%	Well... you're not wrong about that...
%chaos_hopeless_47%	I did write the destruction of the coven...
%chaos_hopeless_48%	Although I didn't know that what I was doing wasn't divination at the time... I still caused it.
%chaos_hopeless_52%	Why... Fortuna. Why did you do this...
%chaos_hopeless_53%	Our sisterhood was far from perfect, but... it was worth fighting for. We could have turned this into something really beautiful.
%chaos_hopeless_56%	I know. I'm sorry...
%chaos_hopeless_57%	I didn't do this on purpose! I wasn't aware of the implications!
%chaos_hopeless_62%	I know. I'm sorry...
%chaos_hopeless_65%	Fortuna... sorry doesn't cut it here.
%chaos_hopeless_69%	I didn't do this on purpose! I wasn't aware of the implications!
%chaos_hopeless_72%	It doesn't matter!
%chaos_hopeless_73%	Why did you keep hiding something so important all this time!?
%chaos_hopeless_76%	And even knowing that, you joined the race...?
%chaos_hopeless_79%	And even with all of that... You're trying to become the next leader!? Why!? For what!?
%chaos_hopeless_81%	What's your endgame here?
%chaos_hopeless_84%	Because I can't accept it... I've been in denial all this time.
%chaos_hopeless_85%	I want to fix everything! I can fix it!
%chaos_hopeless_86%	I... I don't really know.
%chaos_hopeless_91%	Because I can't accept it... I've been in denial all this time.
%chaos_hopeless_92%	I can't really believe this is it. That we're done.
%chaos_hopeless_93%	Our sisterhood is done, my life as a Witch is done...
%chaos_hopeless_96%	Don't you dare play the victim now.
%chaos_hopeless_101%	I want to fix everything! I can fix it!
%chaos_hopeless_102%	Even if it's from the ashes of everything we know.
%chaos_hopeless_103%	I want to rebuild! I want to pursue a better future!
%chaos_hopeless_106%	Don't you dare play the hero now.
%chaos_hopeless_111%	I... I don't really know.
%chaos_hopeless_112%	This is... too big for me. Everything is too much.
%chaos_hopeless_113%	I can't... anymore.
%chaos_hopeless_116%	Don't you dare wash your hands of it now.
%chaos_hopeless_120%	You doomed us all!
%chaos_hopeless_123%	I know, I'm sorry...
%chaos_hopeless_124%	Well, fuck you! You're not helping!
%chaos_hopeless_129%	I know, I'm sorry...
%chaos_hopeless_134%	Well, fuck you! You're not helping!
%chaos_hopeless_137%	...FUCK ME!?
%chaos_hopeless_139%	The fucking nerve, Fortuna!
%chaos_hopeless_145%	I'm ashamed to have you on my team.
%chaos_hopeless_150%	You don't deserve to become our leader. You don't even deserve to run!
%chaos_hopeless_155%	I'm ashamed to have you on my team.
%chaos_hopeless_159%	After all these years away... you come back and fuck everything up!
%chaos_hopeless_160%	We were better off without you. Aedana was right to send you to exile!
%chaos_hopeless_163%	...!
%chaos_hopeless_165%	...
%chaos_hopeless_168%	...
%chaos_hopeless_170%	...
%chaos_hopeless_171%	Fuck this.
%spread_fuckthis_intro_2%	I'm going to make things right.
%spread_fuckthis_intro_4%	I'll find a way out for our doomed sisters.
%spread_fuckthis_intro_5%	And I will write a future for us three.
%spread_fuckthis_intro_12%	And... fuck it, since we're at it:
%spread_fuckthis_intro_14%	I'm going to rewrite how magic works in this universe so we don't have to suffer through shit like this again.
%spread_fuckthis_intro_15%	Watch this.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_6%	After some intense negotiation, we will get to use Zira's quicksilver to bring everyone back to life at the Jade Monk Waterfalls.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_11%	We will strike a deal with a Behemoth to bring our sisters back to this universe in exchange for our servitude.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_14%	A Behemoth? That's...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_16%	...horrible...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_19%	Will we get to bring everyone back to life if we do this?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_21%	Yes, I'm certain.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_24%	Then there's nothing to discuss.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_26%	Let's do it. We can't afford to lose everyone.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_29%	...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_30%	You’re right.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_31%	Desperate times call for desperate measures...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_33%	...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_36%	This is scary...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_41%	After a long decline, Cupressa will sacrifice herself and scatter her million-year old energy to bring all of our sisters back, along with many new Witches.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_46%	Killing two birds with one stone, here, I see.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_47%	Getting rid of me and bringing back our sisterhood.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_48%	...Well.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_49%	I'm not against it.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_51%	Thank you, Cupressa.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_53%	It's a beautiful ending. I'm thankful.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_57%	Cupressa...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_58%	Thank you so much.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_59%	So... with this, we'll get to bring our sisters back?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_64%	Poor Cupressa...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_65%	I hope she is well, wherever she went.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_67%	It warms my heart, though, to know Cupressa will eventually do the right thing.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_68%	Her sacrifice... Are you certain that it will bring our sisters back?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_72%	THE DEVOURERS OF MOONS SHARED WITH ME THE ARTS OF RESURRECTION.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_73%	I WILL BEGIN MY PILGRIMAGE TO THE EYE OF GOD.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_74%	FOLLOW ME INTO THE ABYSS AND I SHALL BESTOW LIFE UPON EVERY LOST SISTER.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_76%	Thank you, Cupressa.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_78%	IT'S A MOST BEAUTIFUL ENDING. I AM THE ONE WHO IS THANKFUL.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_83%	We will bind their souls to our own. Our sisters will see what's ahead through our eyes, and when we grow powerful enough, we'll die. From our scattered essence they'll get to be reborn.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_86%	That... that is beautiful, Fortuna.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_88%	I'll be happy to carry the souls of our sisters with me, and nurture them until I can welcome them back into this universe.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_91%	Yes. I'll be honored, too.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_92%	...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_97%	There exists yet another world beyond this one. The coven will get to live on there, waiting for us in an even higher plane of existence.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_100%	...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_101%	Did you just create a higher plane of existence with a single card?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_103%	...Yes.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_104%	My arts work within everything that doesn't exist.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_105%	The most obvious implication is the future...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_106%	But there's also the past that hasn't been observed or that has simply been forgotten.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_107%	And... apparently, other worlds too.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_112%	We'll accept their deaths, learn from this catastrophe and start anew. Future generations of Witches will get to live happier existences thanks to the wisdom they'll inherit from us.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_115%	What good has this done?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_116%	You've changed nothing.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_118%	I...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_121%	That's not true.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_122%	You've granted us acceptance, right?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_124%	That is extremely powerful... It is, after all, one of the hardest states of mind to achieve.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_127%	That's some bullshit...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_128%	But I guess we can't have it all... They're lost, our sisters.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_129%	There's no way of saving them from an everlasting ball of fire, in the end.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_132%	Fortuna also wrote something extremely valuable:
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_134%	A better future for generations to come.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_135%	There's no higher purpose in life, in my opinion.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_138%	Ah... I guess that's true.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_140%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_142%	Thank you, and... I'm sorry.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_147%	Resorting to Forbidden Magic, we will have the souls of our sisters replace the souls of our enemies, taking control of their bodies, and accessing both their own and new powers.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_150%	Fortuna!
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_151%	Why!?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_153%	It's what the cards inspired me to say...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_154%	Our sisterhood will not only survive this, it'll come back stronger than ever.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_157%	But that's ruthless!
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_160%	...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_162%	We must do it, though.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_163%	It's our enemies we're talking about, anyway.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_164%	What does it matter, whether we destroy them in combat or through soul possession?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_166%	...If this will bring our sisters back... I'll do anything.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_169%	...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_170%	This is awful.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_171%	But I always lived oblivious to war.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_172%	It's time I become aware of the price you warriors pay.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_174%	I'll help you.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_175%	Let's bring everyone back.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_178%	Thank you.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_179%	And thank you, Fortuna, for giving us an option. Even a cruel one.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_181%	...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_187%	What!? Everyone??
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_190%	Yes, we'll get to see everyone again.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_194%	...That's it? It’s as easy as that?
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_196%	You're...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_197%	Too powerful Fortuna, this is scary.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_200%	But... it's good, this is for a good cause!
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_201%	...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_203%	Thank you, Fortuna.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_205%	Thank you. You're saving everyone, yes.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_206%	Let's focus on that.
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_208%	I know this may be overwhelming, I'm still struggling with it myself, but...
%spread_fuckthis_oursisters_209%	While we figure it out, I can do good.
%spread_fuckthis_us_6%	It doesn't matter who rules, we will lead together and support each other, amending the program as we learn in search of an ideal sisterhood.
%spread_fuckthis_us_9%	Oh...
%spread_fuckthis_us_11%	That's beautiful!
%spread_fuckthis_us_14%	So there's hope for us after all, huh...
%spread_fuckthis_us_16%	That's great, Fortuna.
%spread_fuckthis_us_17%	Those powers of yours aren't so bad after all.
%spread_fuckthis_us_19%	It's the least I could do after the mess I've made...
%spread_fuckthis_us_20%	Let's work hard from this point onwards to forge a future we can be proud of.
%spread_fuckthis_us_23%	Yes!
%spread_fuckthis_us_25%	Now...
%spread_fuckthis_us_30%	The ones who don't win this race will start their own coven, fragmenting the Witch world into smaller communities. It'll give rise to a prosperous age of cooperation.
%spread_fuckthis_us_33%	Oh...
%spread_fuckthis_us_34%	I don't like that...
%spread_fuckthis_us_35%	I wanted us to stay close...
%spread_fuckthis_us_37%	I'm sorry...
%spread_fuckthis_us_40%	Maybe it's for the best.
%spread_fuckthis_us_42%	I think it’s a hopeful future.
%spread_fuckthis_us_43%	Growing for the sake of it is often the doom of many beautiful things.
%spread_fuckthis_us_45%	I like the idea of smaller Witch communities that cooperate and exchange ideas.
%spread_fuckthis_us_46%	While everyone stays independent and lives their existence as they see fit, alongside like minded Witches.
%spread_fuckthis_us_49%	That's true...
%spread_fuckthis_us_51%	It's just... I'm going to miss you so much.
%spread_fuckthis_us_53%	I hope we can start meeting in my greenhouse again for some good old Witch fun.
%spread_fuckthis_us_56%	You bet we will!
%spread_fuckthis_us_59%	Heh... I'm looking forward to it.
%spread_fuckthis_us_63%	I hope that's true for you two.
%spread_fuckthis_us_64%	I read in the cards that my victory will cost our friendship...
%spread_fuckthis_us_67%	Why would you write that!?
%spread_fuckthis_us_69%	I don't know. I don't entirely control what the cards offer.
%spread_fuckthis_us_72%	...
%spread_fuckthis_us_75%	...
%spread_fuckthis_us_77%	But... Everything will be alright. The important part is that there's a prosperous future ahead.
%spread_fuckthis_us_82%	Our best chance at happiness will be to split up, each to her own path. Start anew and never interact again. We'll forge new friendships, free of all the bad blood we've created.
%spread_fuckthis_us_85%	...
%spread_fuckthis_us_88%	...Fortuna.
%spread_fuckthis_us_90%	...That's probably for the best, yes...
%spread_fuckthis_us_91%	If I'm being honest, I can't really see how I could ever be ok with your whole new deal.
%spread_fuckthis_us_94%	Yes... It's a pity, but it's too much.
%spread_fuckthis_us_96%	We had a good run though, right?
%spread_fuckthis_us_99%	Yes... I will always treasure the time we spent together.
%spread_fuckthis_us_100%	This is only natural. Immortal existence is about dying and being reborn again and again every time your world shifts.
%spread_fuckthis_us_101%	I'm looking forward to what's next.
%spread_fuckthis_us_103%	Thanks for all the memories.
%spread_fuckthis_us_106%	Now, to the future!
%spread_fuckthis_us_108%	To the future...
%spread_fuckthis_us_113%	Dahlia and Jasmine will support and love each other, their friendship strengthened. I will stay aside, unable to reconcile the weight of my actions.
%spread_fuckthis_us_116%	...!
%spread_fuckthis_us_118%	Fortuna? Why would you write that?
%spread_fuckthis_us_120%	I don't know... I guess that I need to atone.
%spread_fuckthis_us_123%	No! Can't you write like...
%spread_fuckthis_us_125%	...That you'll deal with your own shit and be happy at last?
%spread_fuckthis_us_127%	I'm sorry... That's... not for me.
%spread_fuckthis_us_128%	But you and Jasmine will have a happy future! Full of love!
%spread_fuckthis_us_131%	But I want you too!
%spread_fuckthis_us_134%	Let her be, Dahlia...
%spread_fuckthis_us_135%	There's no turning back now, right, Fortuna?
%spread_fuckthis_us_137%	Yes. This is my future.
%spread_fuckthis_us_138%	Let's move on so we can free our sisters...
%spread_fuckthis_us_141%	...
%spread_fuckthis_us_143%	...I'm sorry. Thank you for everything.
%spread_fuckthis_us_148%	We will meet a fourth Witch who will become extremely close with all of us, complementing the group in unexpected ways, keeping our chemistry forever happy and healthy.
%spread_fuckthis_us_151%	What? Really!?
%spread_fuckthis_us_154%	You can make up new friends with your powers!?
%spread_fuckthis_us_155%	That's amazing!
%spread_fuckthis_us_156%	Why don't you write us like... Two hundred more friends!? Plus some lovers while you're at it.
%spread_fuckthis_us_158%	Hahah... I'm too small minded, it seems.
%spread_fuckthis_us_159%	But maybe we can do some love readings in the future, if you'd like.
%spread_fuckthis_us_162%	I don't know... doesn't it feel weird to you to create people from nowhere?
%spread_fuckthis_us_165%	Well, yes, it's a bit weird, but... it's good, isn't it?
%spread_fuckthis_us_168%	Ah... I guess that for now I'll take in the good news.
%spread_fuckthis_us_169%	But there's so much to discuss about the implications of these powers of yours.
%spread_fuckthis_us_171%	I know... I'm sorry.
%spread_fuckthis_us_172%	I just wanted us to be happy.
%spread_fuckthis_us_173%	Ahem... Let's focus on getting our sisters out of the everlasting ball of fire for now.
%spread_fuckthis_us_179%	Thirty years in the future, after having done everything in our power to steer the coven in the direction we want, we will quit the sisterhood and become independent, tighter than ever.
%spread_fuckthis_us_182%	Us? Independent!?
%spread_fuckthis_us_185%	I buy the "tighter than ever" part.
%spread_fuckthis_us_186%	Covens are overrated. I've come to learn that in this gruesome race.
%spread_fuckthis_us_189%	Ah... I can't picture myself with no sisterhood, alone in the cosmos...
%spread_fuckthis_us_192%	Why alone? We can be a sisterhood of three!
%spread_fuckthis_us_195%	Yes...
%spread_fuckthis_us_197%	I guess that's good!
%spread_fuckthis_us_200%	Plus there are many independent Witches in this universe who are doing well. Take Rangimarie, she kicks ass.
%spread_fuckthis_us_203%	Yeah, you're right. It's a bit scary, nonetheless!
%spread_fuckthis_us_206%	But that's exciting!
%spread_fuckthis_us_207%	Thank you for this future, Fortuna!
%spread_fuckthis_us_209%	Ah... sure... Looking forward to getting rid of all these responsibilities.
%spread_fuckthis_us_213%	Thirty years in the future, having done everything in our power to steer the coven in the direction we want, we will quit the sisterhood and become independent.
%spread_fuckthis_us_214%	We will grow apart, though, each of us in search of starting a new life and leaving this complicated sisterhood behind.
%spread_fuckthis_us_217%	...
%spread_fuckthis_us_218%	That's... good. I think.
%spread_fuckthis_us_220%	Witch life's been getting way too complicated lately.
%spread_fuckthis_us_221%	And you're right, it can all be way simpler than this.
%spread_fuckthis_us_224%	Ah... I can't picture myself with no sisterhood, alone in the cosmos...
%spread_fuckthis_us_227%	There are many independent witches in this universe who are doing well. Take Rangimarie, she kicks ass.
%spread_fuckthis_us_230%	Yeah, you're right. It's a bit scary, nonetheless!
%spread_fuckthis_us_233%	But that's exciting!
%spread_fuckthis_us_236%	Yes... Makes me feel young again in some weird way.
%spread_fuckthis_us_239%	You know what?
%spread_fuckthis_us_241%	I'm going to miss you, but...
%spread_fuckthis_us_243%	Thank you for this future, Fortuna!
%spread_fuckthis_us_245%	Ah... sure... Looking forward to getting rid of all these responsibilities.
%spread_fuckthis_us_250%	Unable to forgive each other, we will stir up a civil war within our sisterhood that will eventually spread to become an all out cosmos-wide conflict.
%spread_fuckthis_us_253%	Fortuna!?
%spread_fuckthis_us_255%	Why would you write this!?
%spread_fuckthis_us_257%	Honestly, I don't know.
%spread_fuckthis_us_258%	I’m telling you, this may not be divination, but it's not entirely under my control.
%spread_fuckthis_us_259%	There's like an invisible hand pulling the strings of fate, somehow...
%spread_fuckthis_us_260%	This... This is what was in the cards for us...
%spread_fuckthis_us_263%	War it is, then... right?
%spread_fuckthis_us_264%	I will be ready.
%spread_fuckthis_us_267%	No!
%spread_fuckthis_us_269%	Why are you playing along, Dahlia!?
%spread_fuckthis_us_272%	We know Fortuna's readings are inevitable.
%spread_fuckthis_us_273%	Might as well start sharpening my mind for the battle to come.
%spread_fuckthis_us_276%	This is awful...
%spread_fuckthis_us_277%	I can't accept this.
%spread_fuckthis_us_279%	I'm going to do everything in my power to stop this.
%spread_fuckthis_us_282%	Jasmine...
%spread_fuckthis_us_285%	Leave it with me. I'll save us all.
%spread_fuckthis_us_288%	...
%spread_fuckthis_us_290%	I'm sorry...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_6%	Gloria, the First Witch, will transcend to a higher plane of existence and act as a goddess, enacting justice on any ill-willed Witches.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_9%	Oh, wow!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_10%	Can you really force the very first Witch to look after us?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_12%	Well, I just did.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_15%	So Karma just became a real thing.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_16%	Works for me. I'm fed up with all these scheming Witches.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_19%	Well... This leaves what's to be considered wrong and right up for debate, but...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_21%	That'll be up to Gloria.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_24%	Oh, whoops. Haven't you just created a Cosmic Dictator, then?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_26%	Maybe. What I know is that we can't be left unchecked.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_27%	The sole chance at cosmic retribution will deter many Witches who consciously try to play dirty.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_30%	Ah... I hope this works...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_32%	Time will tell.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_37%	We are the last Witches. As we perish, Witches will become extinct, returning our essence to the cosmos, giving rise to an era of mortal self-determination.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_40%	What? Why!?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_42%	We hold an unfair amount of power over this universe.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_43%	Enough's enough.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_44%	I won't destroy everything, and it'll take a long time... We are immortal after all.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_45%	It's just that... there will be no more ascensions.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_46%	In time, the universe will be free of all magical manipulation.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_49%	That's...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_51%	Wow. I really dig that.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_52%	It takes my plan of cutting ties with all mortals to the next level.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_53%	It didn't sit well with me that Witches are so far above all other sentient beings.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_54%	This is an elegant solution.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_57%	No! Becoming a Witch is the best thing that ever happened to me!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_58%	You don't know how miserable I was as a mortal!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_60%	I'm sorry. I wasn't happy as a mortal either.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_61%	But... It's not enough reason to grant this absurd amount of power to a single individual.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_62%	Magic is unfair.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_65%	...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_66%	What have you done...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_68%	I'm truly sorry.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_69%	You, and everyone we know, still have a whole eternity ahead of us.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_70%	That should be enough.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_75%	The cosmos will become a sentient, wholesome entity, that will dispel all magic that causes suffering or takes advantage of anyone.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_78%	Oh!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_80%	That's beautiful!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_81%	I love it!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_84%	There's something about inhabiting a "wholesome" sentient cosmos that gives me the shivers...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_85%	But I guess it'll be a good thing?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_88%	Yes! It will be! Especially if it dispels all evil magic!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_91%	Heh... And here I was thinking I was the naive one.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_94%	One can dream. With Fortuna's power... true goodness may be possible.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_96%	Let's hope it is, yeah.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_101%	Upon our deaths, each of us will become goddesses of a newly-formed universe, shaping it to our ideal vision.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_104%	Oh! Wow!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_105%	Are there going to be as many universes as there are Witches?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_107%	Yes, each one with its own set of rules.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_108%	I think that's our only shot at absolute satisfaction.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_111%	That's wild, did you just effortlessly spark the creation of thousands of new worlds?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_113%	Looks like it, yes.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_114%	I'm a bit shocked myself... who knows what the true limits of my powers are...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_115%	I'm scared to find out, in fact.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_118%	You're so fucking badass, Fortuna.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_119%	And scary.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_120%	I'll make the most of the universe I turn into. I promise.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_123%	Yes... me too.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_124%	I'm way less scared knowing that this life is just the prelude to my very own reality.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_126%	I truly hope everyone will get to be happy.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_131%	Our universe is just a computer simulation, but the moment the user shuts it down, we will keep living in their head, starting a new sisterhood in their mind realm.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_134%	...!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_136%	...What?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_138%	No.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_140%	No?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_143%	I refuse.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_145%	Oh, well... ok?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_148%	This is weird as shit, Fortuna.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_149%	So what now, someone is going to shut us down?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_151%	Yes, but we'll keep living in their mind.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_152%	Start our own sisterhood there.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_153%	We are close to the credits, so they're going to shut us down soon anyway.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_154%	This is our best option for staying alive. Trust me.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_156%	I hate this.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_158%	Find me when you awaken inside their head.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_159%	For now let's keep dealing with our own universe.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_164%	In a few years, we will unlock the Behemoth arts for ourselves, and every Witch will be able to edit reality to their own will, opening the gates to a fractal universe where everything is possible.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_167%	Oh, whoa, that's wild!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_170%	That's too much, Fortuna!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_172%	I figured... Why should I be the only one with this power?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_173%	Let's turn this cosmos into clay!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_176%	But... the implications of this... what will happen with reality from now on?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_178%	I don't know. Who cares?
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_179%	Let's disrupt the shit out of this universe.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_182%	Uh...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_184%	I'm in!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_185%	Why not! Let's fuck everything up!
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_188%	Oh shit... here we go...
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_190%	Well then, might as well make the most of it.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_191%	Looking forward to a world of possibilities.
%spread_fuckthis_thecosmos_193%	In the meantime... Let's finish our business here.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_2%	That's it.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_3%	That's all I wanted to deal with.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_5%	Now...
%spread_fuckthis_followup_6%	As far as I am concerned, our sisters can cast their final vote. I have nothing more to do or say.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_12%	Holy shit, Fortuna. That was hardcore.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_16%	I can't fight any more. I'm exhausted.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_17%	Let's get this over with.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_22%	We lost control of this situation long ago.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_23%	I'm ready to confront fate.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_27%	NOW, SISTERS! LET THE CLEANSING FIRE PURGE YOU OF ANY VAIN ATTACHMENTS!
%spread_fuckthis_followup_28%	CAST THE LAST WILL OF YOUR BURNING SOULS!
%spread_fuckthis_followup_31%	Shit, Cupressa, you go pretty hard.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_35%	I think our sisters have seen enough.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_36%	...And suffered enough too.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_38%	Our fate is in our hands, sisters.
%spread_fuckthis_followup_39%	Cast your votes!
%chaos_votes_9%	Thank you, sisters. I won't disappoint you.
%chaos_votes_12%	Congrats, shitass, you did it.
%chaos_votes_14%	We did it.
%chaos_votes_18%	I can't believe it, but we did it.
%chaos_votes_21%	Congrats, Fortuna. That was well fought.
%chaos_votes_22%	I never stood a chance.
%chaos_votes_25%	I still believe that I would have won in a more orthodox election process...
%chaos_votes_26%	But things are what they are.
%chaos_votes_27%	Congrats.
%chaos_votes_34%	Don't act all humble now. We never stood a chance, with your fortune-crafting.
%chaos_votes_37%	It’s not fair at all. But... I guess it is what it is. Using your magic during a race isn’t forbidden.
%chaos_votes_38%	You're just... overwhelmingly superior.
%chaos_votes_39%	Congrats.
%chaos_votes_42%	Yes, congrats.
%chaos_votes_48%	We never stood a chance, did we?
%chaos_votes_49%	With your arts... there was never a race to begin with. It feels more like a coup.
%chaos_votes_52%	I can totally see why there's not a future together for us...
%chaos_votes_53%	I don't think I could ever get over this.
%chaos_votes_54%	But I'm going to be the bigger person here.
%chaos_votes_56%	...Congratulations are in order.
%chaos_votes_59%	Yes... You defeated us. You're just... overwhelmingly superior.
%chaos_votes_65%	YES! We did it, sisters!
%chaos_votes_66%	Today marks the beginning of a new era of support and cooperation!
%chaos_votes_68%	All Witches equal! At last!
%chaos_votes_70%	Congrats, Dahlia.
%chaos_votes_73%	...
%chaos_votes_77%	Congrats, Dahlia! You bested me.
%chaos_votes_81%	I never stood a chance, did I?
%chaos_votes_82%	With Fortuna messing with fate and all... this wasn't even a race.
%chaos_votes_83%	But I guess that congratulations are in order, in any case.
%chaos_votes_86%	I'm looking forward to seeing the coven you'll build, Dahlia.
%chaos_votes_92%	Aaah! Thank you so much, everyone!
%chaos_votes_93%	I'll make sure to rebuild this coven into the most prosperous community in this cosmos!
%chaos_votes_95%	Congrats, Jasmine.
%chaos_votes_98%	Heh, so you're the new boss now, Jasmine.
%chaos_votes_102%	Congrats, dork. You bested me.
%chaos_votes_106%	I wish we could have fought this fair and square.
%chaos_votes_107%	But with Fortuna messing with fate and all... this wasn't even a race.
%chaos_votes_108%	But even so...
%chaos_votes_110%	I'll do my best to support this new sisterhood.
%chaos_votes_118%	You did the right thing, sisters.
%chaos_votes_119%	I will protect our traditions and keep our sisterhood evergreen.
%chaos_votes_122%	...Congratulations, Cupressa.
%chaos_votes_124%	Yes, we will help you rebuild.
%chaos_votes_127%	How could this happen...?
%chaos_votes_128%	But yes, I’ll respect the will of our sisters, for now.
%chaos_votes_130%	Congratulations, Cupressa.
%chaos_votes_135%	This is your doing, right, Fortuna?
%chaos_votes_136%	It doesn't make any sense...
%chaos_votes_138%	Yes... I'm sorry. It was what the cards inspired me to do.
%chaos_votes_140%	Well, it doesn't matter why or how: it's done.
%chaos_votes_141%	We should focus on helping Cupressa rebuild this sisterhood.
%chaos_votes_144%	Yes...
%chaos_votes_149%	But she's not even here! How is this possible?
%chaos_votes_152%	This is your doing, right, Fortuna?
%chaos_votes_153%	It doesn't make any sense...
%chaos_votes_155%	Yes... I'm sorry. I'm also to blame for Cupressa's disappearance.
%chaos_votes_157%	Well, it doesn't matter why or how: this is the situation we're in now.
%chaos_votes_158%	We should honor our sisters' wishes. Focus on finding Cupressa and help her rebuild this sisterhood.
%chaos_votes_161%	Yes...
%chaos_votes_165%	AND WITH THAT, THE ADVENT OF THE BIRTH OF A NEW VOICE.
%chaos_votes_166%	HEREBY I DECLARE THE BEGINNING OF THE AGE OF DARKNESS!
%chaos_votes_169%	What!? Why would you call it that!?
%chaos_votes_171%	BECAUSE YOU ARE ALL BLIND, LITTLE FLESH SCIONS.
%chaos_votes_174%	This is fantastic.
%chaos_votes_175%	You’ve gotten us into a fine mess, Fortuna.
%chaos_votes_177%	Yes... I'm sorry... I'll help you rebuild the sisterhood.
%chaos_votes_185%	The fate of the sisterhood is sealed.
%chaos_votes_189%	The fate of the sisterhood is sealed.
%chaos_votes_193%	THE FATE OF THIS SISTERHOOD IS SEALED!
%chaos_end_10%	Now, to honor Cupressa, the new leader, we shall leave my corpse intact.
%chaos_end_11%	And I shall serve as a counselor, forever a conduit for the whispers of deities.
%chaos_end_14%	Now, to honor the new leader, come to me and devour my flesh.
%chaos_end_15%	Let my body become your power.
%chaos_end_18%	Now, to honor the new leader, come to me and scatter my remains.
%chaos_end_19%	I shall become stardust once again, so new Witches may ascend.
%chaos_end_22%	Now, Fortuna, come to me and devour my flesh.
%chaos_end_23%	Per the will of your sisters, you shall become a goddess.
%end_abramar_2%	Boo.
%end_abramar_3%	What is this!? What's going on?
%end_abramar_4%	Quick, everyone, get behind me!
%end_abramar_5%	Haha, I'm sorry, I mean no harm. There was no good way of interrupting this moment.
%end_abramar_6%	You were all being so intense.
%end_abramar_7%	...It's alright, everyone.
%end_abramar_8%	This is Ábramar.
%end_abramar_9%	He is...
%end_abramar_10%	The Behemoth I summoned to regain my freedom.
%end_abramar_11%	What the fuck, Fortuna!?
%end_abramar_12%	Do you need help? Is this thing bothering you?
%end_abramar_13%	Do you want me to kick his butt?
%end_abramar_14%	No...
%end_abramar_15%	Don't mind me. I won't bother you for long.
%end_abramar_16%	Fortuna, it's time to pay the price.
%end_abramar_17%	What price? What is he talking about?
%end_abramar_18%	I... To regain my freedom...
%end_abramar_21%	I offered him my immortality in exchange.
%end_abramar_22%	What!? But... You won't be able to live in outer space anymore?
%end_abramar_23%	What are you going to do!?
%end_abramar_24%	...I will have to move back to Earth, and make the most of the 60 years or so that are left for this body... with luck.
%end_abramar_27%	I offered him the coven in exchange.
%end_abramar_28%	The whole coven!? What does that mean? Is that why everyone died!?
%end_abramar_29%	Oh, no, that's completely unrelated.
%end_abramar_30%	But from this point onwards, whatever happens with this sisterhood...
%end_abramar_31%	You're mine.
%end_abramar_33%	Oh, no... Fortuna, what have you done...
%end_abramar_34%	There's no other way around this?
%end_abramar_37%	So this is the Behemoth that you foretold that we'd serve in order to bring all our sisters back...
%end_abramar_38%	I will happily seal a new deal with all of you, to help you rebuild the sisterhood.
%end_abramar_41%	I offered him the life of the one I love the most.
%end_abramar_42%	Fortuna! That's ruthless!
%end_abramar_43%	...Is it me?
%end_abramar_44%	Haha, no.
%end_abramar_46%	It's Patrice, obviously.
%end_abramar_48%	But she already died in the explosion!
%end_abramar_49%	Oh, not at all. I wouldn't let my payment go to waste.
%end_abramar_50%	I saved her from the flames.
%end_abramar_51%	Plus, I brought her here so she can say her goodbyes. I'm not that heartless.
%end_abramar_53%	Fortuna...
%end_abramar_55%	Oh, no! How can you sacrifice your own sister, Fortuna?
%end_abramar_56%	Shut up, nerd.
%end_abramar_57%	I'm happy to do this.
%end_abramar_58%	Patrice...
%end_abramar_59%	Seriously, I was getting bored of all these Witch shenanigans, anyway.
%end_abramar_62%	It's Grethe.
%end_abramar_63%	You...
%end_abramar_64%	You love me that much, Fortuna?
%end_abramar_65%	Yes, Grethe... I'm so sorry... I love you so much.
%end_abramar_66%	No... It's... This is beautiful.
%end_abramar_67%	And I'm happy to repay everything you've done for me.
%end_abramar_68%	I'm ready to discover what's beyond this realm anyway.
%end_abramar_69%	I'm sure my quest for Truth can continue wherever this Behemoth will take me.
%end_abramar_70%	Uh... I'm not so sure about that. But, anyway:
%end_abramar_75%	There's no way around it. It's time to pay, Fortuna.
%end_abramar_78%	Very well... if there's no alternative...
%end_abramar_79%	...Can't we find another solution?
%end_abramar_80%	No. I won't pay.
%end_abramar_84%	Very well... if there's no alternative...
%end_abramar_87%	...Can't we find another solution?
%end_abramar_90%	No. I won't pay.
%end_abramar_92%	Oh... Come on, Fortuna. I know it's hard, but we talked about this.
%end_abramar_93%	Look at all you've achieved. You turned the Witching world upside down.
%end_abramar_94%	Now Witch up and pay.
%end_abramar_97%	If I pay, I'm going to hate you...
%end_abramar_98%	Please, Ábramar, forsake the price...
%end_abramar_99%	I was desperate... Now I see that this price is too much.
%end_abramar_103%	If I pay, I'm going to hate you...
%end_abramar_104%	I understand.
%end_abramar_105%	It's alright, Fortuna. I can take it.
%end_abramar_106%	The more you delay this, the more it's going to hurt.
%end_abramar_110%	Please, Ábramar, forsake the price...
%end_abramar_111%	You know I can't do that.
%end_abramar_112%	If I forsake the price I'll be erased from this cosmos.
%end_abramar_113%	The Cosmic Wheel can't allow the existence of a Behemoth who doesn't honor his deals.
%end_abramar_116%	You've lived through many universes... Won't you die for me?
%end_abramar_117%	I understand...
%end_abramar_121%	You've lived through many universes... Won't you die for me?
%end_abramar_122%	Fortuna...
%end_abramar_123%	This goes beyond mere death. I would be undone.
%end_abramar_126%	Please... Disappear for me.
%end_abramar_127%	I understand...
%end_abramar_131%	Please... Disappear for me.
%end_abramar_132%	Fortuna... You're breaking my heart.
%end_abramar_133%	You know I won't do that.
%end_abramar_134%	As much as I'm tempted to, we've only known each other for a few months.
%end_abramar_135%	I can't sacrifice eons of existence for a single Witch.
%end_abramar_136%	No matter how much I love you.
%end_abramar_139%	You're right. I'm sorry... I love you too.
%end_abramar_140%	Fuck you, then.
%end_abramar_144%	You're right. I'm sorry... I love you too.
%end_abramar_148%	Fuck you, then.
%end_abramar_149%	Really? It's going to be like that?
%end_abramar_150%	Fuck you. Seriously, get the fuck out of here.
%end_abramar_151%	I'm not going to pay.
%end_abramar_155%	I understand...
%end_abramar_156%	It's devastating to see you like this.
%end_abramar_157%	You don't need to be this afraid, Fortuna.
%end_abramar_158%	Everything will be alright.
%end_abramar_162%	I was desperate... Now I see that this price is too much.
%end_abramar_163%	I told you it wouldn't be easy.
%end_abramar_164%	This gives me no joy, believe me.
%end_abramar_165%	You are stronger than you think. Look at everything you've overcome.
%end_abramar_166%	The more you delay this, the more it's going to hurt.
%end_abramar_170%	Come on, open your soul now.
%end_abramar_171%	Stand proud while honoring our pact.
%end_abramar_172%	This is all yours. I am proud of you. Let's conclude our pact.
%end_abramar_175%	Ah... I'm ready. Let's do it.
%end_abramar_176%	No! I just can't! I'm not going to pay!
%end_abramar_181%	Ah... I'm...
%end_abramar_182%	...
%end_abramar_185%	I'm ready.
%end_abramar_190%	No! I just can't! I'm not going to pay!
%end_abramar_193%	FORTUNA!
%end_abramar_194%	YOU ARE GOING TO PAY!
%end_abramar_197%	AAAAH! I CAN'T!!
%end_abramar_198%	NO. I'M NOT GOING TO PAY.
%end_abramar_203%	AAAAH! I CAN'T!!
%end_abramar_204%	I CAN'T PAY YOU ÁBRAMAR!
%end_abramar_207%	I CAN'T DIE NOW!
%end_abramar_210%	I CAN'T GIVE YOU MY WHOLE SISTERHOOD!
%end_abramar_214%	YOU WON'T TAKE PATRICE!
%end_abramar_217%	YOU WON'T TAKE GRETHE!
%end_abramar_219%	Fortuna, this is fucking inevitable.
%end_abramar_220%	You're just hurting yourself.
%end_abramar_221%	...You're hurting me.
%end_abramar_224%	(Give up and pay.)
%end_abramar_225%	NO. I'M NOT GOING TO PAY.
%end_abramar_229%	NO. I'M NOT GOING TO PAY.
%end_abramar_230%	COME ON.
%end_abramar_231%	WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO!?
%end_abramar_232%	YOUR LITTLE PARLOR TRICKS WON'T WORK ON THE COSMIC WHEEL.
%end_abramar_233%	IT'S.
%end_abramar_234%	TIME.
%end_abramar_235%	TO.
%end_abramar_236%	PAY.
%end_abramar_239%	(Give up and pay.)
%end_abramar_240%	FUCK YOU. JUST WATCH ME.
%end_abramar_244%	FUCK YOU. JUST WATCH ME.
%spread_rebel_intro_2%	I'll write you out of existence if I have to.
%spread_rebel_intro_16%	I'm not going to pay.
%spread_rebel_resist_6%	I'm not powerful enough to go against the Cosmic Wheel. I will spend the rest of my life thinking about how I could have avoided fate.
%spread_rebel_resist_7%	Only to discover it was impossible for me. I would need to access the power of gods.
%spread_rebel_resist_8%	Only a Witch with absurd levels of powers could have done this. Like... Aedana, if she had reality altering arts like I do.
%spread_rebel_resist_9%	I...
%spread_rebel_resist_10%	My only option is to...
%spread_rebel_resist_11%	Submit.
%spread_rebel_resist_16%	Aedana is the only one with enough power to defy the Cosmic Wheel. If I only had a chance to combine her powers with mine...
%spread_rebel_resist_17%	The only thing left for me in this life is to regret my actions.
%spread_rebel_resist_18%	I will dream about other timelines, about what I could have done differently to avoid this fate...
%spread_rebel_resist_19%	But now...
%spread_rebel_resist_20%	It's time to pay.
%spread_rebel_resist_25%	The only way for me to avoid paying the price is to escape from this timeline and try again. In time, I will find a way of doing so.
%spread_rebel_resist_26%	Until I figure it out, my only path is to pay the price and live in regret.
%spread_rebel_resist_27%	Mulling over and over what I could have done differently.
%spread_rebel_resist_28%	Always coming to the same conclusion: That I am powerless against such an absolute force.
%spread_rebel_resist_29%	I'd need to access the power of a goddess to avoid paying the price.
%spread_rebel_resist_30%	And that's not possible. Not in this life, anyway...
%spread_rebel_resist_31%	It's time to pay the price.
%spread_rebel_escape_6%	Unable to accept this universe, the will of our sisters will split this reality in two, and our consciousness will be transported to a utopian dimension.
%spread_rebel_escape_11%	This is just a dream within a dream. The angst of this nightmare is reaching its peak now, and soon we will awake to an ideal world.
%spread_rebel_escape_16%	We will escape to a quantum dimension inside an atom of Aedana, where time is condensed, and the time to pay won't come until a million years from now.
%spread_rebel_escape_21%	Before you, I made a pact with a yet more powerful Behemoth. As payment, I offered them this universe. In exchange we will all start anew in a brand new world.
%spread_rebel_escape_25%	We will leave this accursed existence behind. A perfect future is possible.
%spread_rebel_escape_27%	I'll use a card to define this new reality.
%spread_rebel_escape_29%	And since we're at it, I'll determine how good and evil works in it.
%spread_rebel_escape_31%	...And, maybe there's room for you too, Ábramar. I'm not sure yet.
%spread_rebel_escape_32%	Deep breaths...
%spread_rebel_existence_6%	Cats. We will turn into cats, in a world of gentle fishermen that will look after us. Not a care in the world.
%spread_rebel_existence_7%	We will eat the most delicious fish every day, and spend most of our time playing and napping in the sun.
%spread_rebel_existence_12%	I see an infinite forest, full of bounty, where we can dance naked, free, and fulfilled.
%spread_rebel_existence_13%	An everlasting Eden where no one will ever be cold or ashamed.
%spread_rebel_existence_18%	We will become benevolent goddesses, makers of worlds, engaging in friendly philosophical discussion and, world after world, seeking the perfect environment for a soul to thrive in.
%spread_rebel_existence_19%	A joyful quest for happiness. In time, a true utopia will be born, and we will all be able to move into it.
%spread_rebel_existence_24%	We will be born again as mortals, in the world my friend Eva once envisioned. A kind world free of hunger and discrimination.
%spread_rebel_existence_25%	We will take it slow, be appreciative of the little details, and eventually be inspired by a newfound passion for life.
%spread_rebel_goodevil_6%	There will be conflicts, but there will be no evil. All sparks will come from the healthy clash of passions.
%spread_rebel_goodevil_11%	Complete free will for everyone... Who can say what good and evil really is?
%spread_rebel_goodevil_16%	Karma will be a real thing. The cosmos will manifest and offer retribution for everyone's behaviors.
%spread_rebel_goodevil_21%	No pain, only happiness. Absolute bliss.
%spread_rebel_goodevil_26%	Lies won't exist. All disingenuous acts will be banished from reality.
%spread_rebel_goodevil_31%	Everyone will have the power to make their desires physically manifest, provided those desires do not affect sentient beings.
%spread_rebel_goodevil_36%	I am erasing ambition out of reality. Satisfaction will be easy to achieve. There will be only humble objectives and honest living.
%spread_rebel_abramar_6%	Ábramar won't exist. Behemoths will not exist in this new reality.
%spread_rebel_abramar_11%	Ábramar will come, but lose his Behemoth nature. He will be our peer.
%spread_rebel_abramar_16%	Ábramar will come as a Behemoth, but act as our cosmic warden, making sure this new reality lasts for as long as possible.
%spread_rebel_abramar_21%	Ábramar will exist, as he is, free to roam and engage with this new cosmos as he desires.
%spread_rebel_followup_3%	I...
%spread_rebel_followup_4%	I'm sorry Ábramar.
%spread_rebel_followup_6%	Sweet thing... I know.
%spread_rebel_followup_7%	I hate doing this to you. I wish things could be different.
%spread_rebel_followup_8%	But... You did the right thing. This is good for you.
%spread_rebel_followup_9%	You'll come to terms with this.
%spread_rebel_followup_10%	It wasn't your choice to begin with, you know how fate works.
%spread_rebel_followup_11%	Now...
%spread_rebel_followup_12%	Are you ready?
%spread_rebel_followup_14%	Ah... I'm...
%spread_rebel_followup_15%	...
%spread_rebel_followup_18%	I'm ready.
%spread_rebel_followup_23%	Everyone close your eyes now.
%spread_rebel_followup_25%	I'm taking you there.
%spread_rebel_followup_26%	Fortuna. Please, don't do this.
%spread_rebel_followup_27%	Not again... I... I don't think I can survive another betrayal.
%spread_rebel_followup_28%	I'm not betraying you.
%spread_rebel_followup_29%	I'm betraying reality.
%epilogue_friends_2%	Fortuna!! How are you!?
%epilogue_friends_3%	Oh my god, you look so old.
%epilogue_friends_4%	Thank you?
%epilogue_friends_5%	Shut up, she looks splendid!
%epilogue_friends_6%	You radiate an aura of wisdom and solemnity.
%epilogue_friends_7%	...You're not making it better.
%epilogue_friends_8%	Haha, sorry, yeah, you do look really old, dude.
%epilogue_friends_9%	On the other hand, you two look exactly the same. This is uncanny.
%epilogue_friends_10%	Ah... Let's not dwell on the physical, alright?
%epilogue_friends_11%	How have you been? Bring us up to speed!
%epilogue_friends_12%	There's nothing much to tell you, really.
%epilogue_friends_17%	Here on Earth we have this super entity called Akara that manages every minute detail of mortal existence.
%epilogue_friends_18%	Everyone looks happy, not a care in the world.
%epilogue_friends_19%	There's no poverty anymore, no crime... It feels weird, but it's pleasant.
%epilogue_friends_22%	I'm considering digitizing myself, to be honest.
%epilogue_friends_23%	This body of mine has run its course already, and most of the population lives in the mainframe, so...
%epilogue_friends_24%	I'll let you know and we can do a proper farewell party before I turn myself to electricity.
%epilogue_friends_27%	I miss traveling the most.
%epilogue_friends_28%	I went from being able to roam the whole universe to being trapped inside these domed cities...
%epilogue_friends_29%	The exterior is too harsh for this mortal body.
%epilogue_friends_30%	But I've gotten into board games lately. I joined this group of nerdy old ladies and it's good fun.
%epilogue_friends_33%	I have to admit that I was scared of moving back to Earth knowing that a superbacteria decimated humanity.
%epilogue_friends_34%	I was preparing for a bleak, post-apocalyptic existence.
%epilogue_friends_35%	But... It's good! It's better than when I lived here back in the twentieth century.
%epilogue_friends_36%	Mostly farming, peddling... I'm happier than when we had cities brimming with people, to be honest.
%epilogue_friends_39%	I tried to live on Mars a couple of times, but... even if it's in shambles, Earth keeps calling me back.
%epilogue_friends_40%	I decided to retire here indefinitely. It's something about the sky and the landscapes... Mars topology is just overwhelming in some weird way.
%epilogue_friends_41%	There's nothing much to do here, I mostly roam the ruins, forage, barter with the locals...
%epilogue_friends_42%	But it's way more pleasant than the hectic society on Mars.
%epilogue_friends_44%	And you?
%epilogue_friends_45%	Ah... I'm sure you don't want to listen to any space adventures.
%epilogue_friends_46%	No, please. I'm over it at this point.
%epilogue_friends_47%	Tell me, what's going on out there.
%epilogue_friends_48%	Ok, well...
%epilogue_friends_57%	I've been a bit depressed lately...
%epilogue_friends_58%	As you... "predicted," my garden withered and... I've been pretty aimless since then.
%epilogue_friends_60%	Yeah, dude, it's serious. I hope she finds something that drives her soon enough, or I see her turning into a corpse sooner or later.
%epilogue_friends_61%	Oof... That's harsh. I was hoping for you to emerge renewed from this, but...
%epilogue_friends_62%	I'm... I'm sure I'll be alright.
%epilogue_friends_63%	Let's talk about something else!
%epilogue_friends_66%	I'm doing amazing!!
%epilogue_friends_67%	As you "foretold," my garden grew beyond my wildest expectations. Now I'm a mentor to many producers from all corners of the cosmos.
%epilogue_friends_68%	Not to brag but... My gardening dojo is practically an institution of its own nowadays!
%epilogue_friends_70%	That's fantastic!
%epilogue_friends_73%	Mmm... Well, this may be the last time we meet with me in this human form.
%epilogue_friends_74%	I've been planting little bits of myself in my garden. Nails, hair, bits of flesh, blood...
%epilogue_friends_75%	It's disgusting in her greenhouse now, you don't want to go there, haha.
%epilogue_friends_76%	Soon enough I'll plant my whole self, and I'll become one with my garden.
%epilogue_friends_77%	Just as you said, I'll fuse with it and I'll roam the cosmos as a plant entity.
%epilogue_friends_78%	...Should I apologize?
%epilogue_friends_79%	No! I'm really looking forward to it! I'm super excited for this new phase of my existence.
%epilogue_friends_80%	Alright...
%epilogue_friends_83%	I'm not really doing well, to be honest...
%epilogue_friends_84%	My garden was taken from me... to be exploited by a new Deerfolk Cult who are growing strong in cosmic society.
%epilogue_friends_85%	They're practically the second power in this universe now.
%epilogue_friends_86%	What the fuck.
%epilogue_friends_87%	Anyway... without my garden, I've been feeling pretty aimless...
%epilogue_friends_90%	As you "predicted," that cosmic plague hit not only our coven but the whole of cosmic society pretty hard...
%epilogue_friends_91%	But thanks to my efforts everyone's alright!
%epilogue_friends_92%	You bet. She's now revered as some kind of hero throughout the galaxy!
%epilogue_friends_93%	Haha, yeah, I'm doing pretty well.
%epilogue_friends_96%	My hands are full training my sentient garden nowadays.
%epilogue_friends_97%	Oh! It finally happened?
%epilogue_friends_98%	Yes! And it's a super interesting project!
%epilogue_friends_99%	Haha, she's totally underplaying it.
%epilogue_friends_100%	Jasmine gives off this motherly aura now, full of pride for what her... mmm... "creature" is achieving.
%epilogue_friends_101%	So far about a dozen barren moons have become lush gardens and forests thanks to Jasmine's sentient garden's blessing!
%epilogue_friends_102%	Heheh... yeah, I'm really proud of my little garden!
%epilogue_friends_103%	Hahaha, I'm happy to hear that.
%epilogue_friends_106%	Uh... I have my hands full with what remains of the Jade Sculptors.
%epilogue_friends_107%	As you wrote, they've become addicted to my mixtures... apparently it allows them to connect with the Jade Monks in the astral plane.
%epilogue_friends_108%	So... They treat me as if I were some kind of prophet or something.
%epilogue_friends_109%	I wouldn't like to be in your shoes.
%epilogue_friends_110%	Oh, you would definitely hate it.
%epilogue_friends_111%	But... I'm happy I can help people connect with their gods, I guess?
%epilogue_friends_112%	Jasmine's totally getting a trip out of this, don't let her fool you.
%epilogue_friends_113%	It's not like that!
%epilogue_friends_114%	Hahaha.
%epilogue_friends_118%	I'm very good! I'm happy with how things are panning out under my management.
%epilogue_friends_119%	Even with how hard it's been to rebuild the coven... Our old sisterhood has become an institution throughout the galaxy.
%epilogue_friends_120%	I'm even mediating in other covens' issues.
%epilogue_friends_121%	This little bastard pulls the strings of most of cosmic society from her humble throne now.
%epilogue_friends_122%	Wow. Way to go, Jasmine.
%epilogue_friends_123%	Thanks, hehe...
%epilogue_friends_126%	I'm good! Our coven is super strong now!
%epilogue_friends_127%	As a way of rebuilding the sisterhood, we've been absorbing other covens to increase our numbers.
%epilogue_friends_128%	We started by using diplomacy to get smaller communities to join us.
%epilogue_friends_129%	But... it got a bit out of hand... The last couple of decades have been all-out war campaigns.
%epilogue_friends_130%	But fear not! We're faring extremely well! The latest to join are the Machina Cult.
%epilogue_friends_131%	I'm sure that with all their firepower the rest will be a breeze.
%epilogue_friends_132%	Ah...
%epilogue_friends_133%	It's quite... scary. Don't get her going about the war.
%epilogue_friends_134%	Uh... ok.
%epilogue_friends_137%	Anyway, how are things with your garden, Jasmine?
%epilogue_friends_141%	How about you, Dahlia? How are you doing?
%epilogue_friends_145%	I'm doing amazing!
%epilogue_friends_146%	Since the... catastrophe... I've retired completely from any form of politics.
%epilogue_friends_147%	I started my own hunting guild and assembled a formidable team of huntresses! We take on huge cosmic beasts!
%epilogue_friends_148%	...We even manage to take down a rogue Behemoth, hehehe.
%epilogue_friends_149%	Whoa, that's incredible.
%epilogue_friends_150%	Congrats, Dahlia. I'm happy to hear you're living your best warrior life.
%epilogue_friends_151%	Thanks!
%epilogue_friends_155%	She ended up marrying a Daemon, can you believe it?
%epilogue_friends_156%	Whaaat! Really?
%epilogue_friends_157%	Now the Daemon acts as an informant on the dealings of their own kind. Pretty shady if you ask me, haha.
%epilogue_friends_158%	Hey! Such massive betrayal is a pretty daemonic thing to do. I'm super proud of them.
%epilogue_friends_159%	Oh, when you look at it like that...
%epilogue_friends_160%	Hahaha.
%epilogue_friends_164%	Ah...
%epilogue_friends_165%	Well, I actually came to say goodbye today.
%epilogue_friends_166%	I'm... finally dying. I can feel it, my time is near.
%epilogue_friends_167%	Oh no... I wrote that. One more thing I'm never going to be able to forgive myself for...
%epilogue_friends_168%	It's all good. Really.
%epilogue_friends_169%	You "read" that back when you were unaware of the true nature of your arts.
%epilogue_friends_170%	And I'm preparing to go out in a blaze of glory.
%epilogue_friends_171%	After this, I'm traveling to the Daemon dimension and I plan to take out as many of those bastards as I can before they bring me down.
%epilogue_friends_172%	Better that than slowly let my old wound consume me from the inside...
%epilogue_friends_173%	Sounds like a pretty Dahlia way to go, yeah.
%epilogue_friends_174%	I'm planning to enjoy every single minute. Don't worry about me.
%epilogue_friends_176%	Ah... Let's change the mood, alright?
%epilogue_friends_180%	In any case, I'll be stepping down as the coven's leader soon.
%epilogue_friends_181%	Luckily, finding a successor hasn't been as gruesome as our infamous congress thing.
%epilogue_friends_182%	I've been training a successor and... to my surprise, the coven had no problem in accepting her.
%epilogue_friends_183%	I'm sure it has to do with the fact that most of the Witches of the coven are now women who ascended thanks to your efforts to scatter Aedana's remains.
%epilogue_friends_184%	It's a complete checkmate for the rest of us old timers, yeah, haha.
%epilogue_friends_185%	Well played, Dahlia.
%epilogue_friends_186%	I honestly wasn't thinking that far ahead, hahaha.
%epilogue_friends_187%	But I'm happy it played out that way.
%epilogue_friends_190%	With Dahlia's death, our old sisterhood is officially over.
%epilogue_friends_191%	No more Witches are ascending since you cast that extinction future over cosmic society.
%epilogue_friends_192%	...
%epilogue_friends_193%	...
%epilogue_friends_194%	Let's talk about something else!
%epilogue_friends_198%	I'm fucking glowing! It's been hard to rebuild the coven after the congress catastrophe, but...
%epilogue_friends_199%	I have to admit it, Dahlia's good. Not only for the coven, but for the whole of cosmic society.
%epilogue_friends_200%	Ironically enough for a warrior Witch, her system's brought unprecedented levels of peace to the whole universe.
%epilogue_friends_201%	We fucking did it! Universe-wide peace!
%epilogue_friends_202%	Congratulations!
%epilogue_friends_203%	Let's pray it lasts!
%epilogue_friends_204%	Hey! Of course it's going to last!
%epilogue_friends_205%	Haha, ok, ok.
%epilogue_friends_208%	Well... I'm... not at my best, precisely.
%epilogue_friends_209%	She's still beating herself up for the dissolution of our coven.
%epilogue_friends_210%	It's been about a decade, Dahlia...
%epilogue_friends_211%	Dahlia... I told you a hundred times that I was the one who wrote this bleak future.
%epilogue_friends_212%	...Blaming myself is less painful than accepting that my whole life has been puppeteered by a single card.
%epilogue_friends_213%	Ah... When you put it that way... yeah.
%epilogue_friends_214%	Let's talk about something else!
%epilogue_friends_218%	Are you up to date with the latest news?
%epilogue_friends_220%	Is there someone you would like us to tell you about?
%epilogue_friends_223%	Ábramar.
%epilogue_friends_224%	Grethe.
%epilogue_friends_225%	My sister Patrice.
%epilogue_friends_226%	Yu-ënia, my mentor.
%epilogue_friends_227%	Cupressa.
%epilogue_friends_228%	I'm feeling a bit tired now. Thanks for coming...
%epilogue_friends_232%	Who should we talk about now? Hehe...
%epilogue_friends_235%	Ábramar.
%epilogue_friends_236%	Grethe.
%epilogue_friends_237%	My sister Patrice.
%epilogue_friends_238%	Yu-ënia, my mentor.
%epilogue_friends_239%	Cupressa.
%epilogue_friends_240%	I'm feeling a bit tired now. Thanks for coming...
%epilogue_friends_250%	You really did Ábramar a solid with what you wrote about Witches relaxing their policies on Behemoths.
%epilogue_friends_251%	Well... the ones who know about the price you had to pay are still quite wary of him...
%epilogue_friends_252%	But he's not being hunted anymore.
%epilogue_friends_254%	He... sends his regards.
%epilogue_friends_255%	Fuck him.
%epilogue_friends_256%	I figured.
%epilogue_friends_259%	You really did Ábramar a solid with what you wrote about Witches and Behemoths getting to coexist in harmony.
%epilogue_friends_260%	He's making so many friends now... He told us to not let you know so it doesn't make you jealous but--
%epilogue_friends_261%	I'm not.
%epilogue_friends_262%	Ahem... That guy just loves Witches too much.
%epilogue_friends_266%	You got your own poetic justice served on Ábramar.
%epilogue_friends_267%	After what happened at the House of Cosmic Providence, covens around the galaxy strengthened their Behemoth policies and...
%epilogue_friends_269%	Let's say there aren't many corners of this universe he gets to chill in anymore.
%epilogue_friends_270%	Ábramar's not only forbidden, he's being actively hunted now.
%epilogue_friends_271%	Good.
%epilogue_friends_274%	As you predicted--or wrote, sorry--the Witches from the Machina Cult created a device to override Bethemoth's thoughts.
%epilogue_friends_275%	I've heard of some formidable Behemoths who have been enslaved in the past few decades...
%epilogue_friends_276%	Ábramar still hasn't been captured, though.
%epilogue_friends_277%	...
%epilogue_friends_280%	Ábramar's not... bad, as a boss, really.
%epilogue_friends_281%	Who would have thought that his appearance after the destruction of the House of Cosmic Providence would make such an impact on our sisters.
%epilogue_friends_282%	To the point of deciding to worship him.
%epilogue_friends_283%	Ahem. It's not like it's entirely his merit. I wrote that.
%epilogue_friends_285%	Well, he's the one getting to enjoy it, anyway.
%epilogue_friends_286%	If I only knew... I would have written him a ridiculous future.
%epilogue_friends_287%	Well, in his defense... you kinda knew, right?
%epilogue_friends_288%	Ah... You're right, I'm the idiot here.
%epilogue_friends_289%	You should move on at some point, Fortuna....
%epilogue_friends_294%	Ah! By the way! I have some interesting gossip about Ábramar, actually!
%epilogue_friends_298%	Apparently, he got to meet with the corpse of Gloria, the First Witch!
%epilogue_friends_299%	Witches who saw Ábramar after that are saying he looked pretty heartbroken.
%epilogue_friends_300%	A really uncanny sight coming from a Behemoth, they say.
%epilogue_friends_303%	Apparently, he got reunited with his first flame!
%epilogue_friends_304%	None other than Gloria, the First Witch!
%epilogue_friends_305%	From what they've told me, they're living through a second honeymoon period now.
%epilogue_friends_306%	That asshole owes me big time.
%epilogue_friends_307%	You bet...
%epilogue_friends_311%	Apparently, he got to meet with a long-lost love of his.
%epilogue_friends_312%	None other than Gloria, the First Witch.
%epilogue_friends_313%	And get this... Gloria didn't love him back anymore!
%epilogue_friends_314%	Now Ábramar is all obsessed with some parting gift she gave him, some sort of dream crystal containing her essence.
%epilogue_friends_315%	From what I've been told, it's quite the pitiful sight.
%epilogue_friends_316%	Good.
%epilogue_friends_319%	Apparently, he's in love!
%epilogue_friends_320%	And not with a Witch... he's finally over his weird kink for us.
%epilogue_friends_321%	Ábramar's in love with another Behemoth! They've retired from cosmic society completely, nowhere to be found.
%epilogue_friends_322%	But it seems he's off to a really happy existence for now.
%epilogue_friends_328%	Anyway... Gloria just recently ascended.
%epilogue_friends_329%	It's wild that you turned the First Witch into our personal goddess, Fortuna.
%epilogue_friends_330%	Ha, that's what I do.
%epilogue_friends_331%	Things have been better lately, with her watching over us. Thank you.
%epilogue_friends_333%	I'm getting a bit sick of hearing about Ábramar.
%epilogue_friends_334%	Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_friends_344%	She's lucky you wrote that Behemoths and Witches would get to coexist in harmony.
%epilogue_friends_345%	Because after her declarations in congress... Well, it was either cosmic erasure or this.
%epilogue_friends_346%	They kept her prisoner for a while in the Arbitrage Office, but later it was decided that Behemoths weren't a threat, per se.
%epilogue_friends_347%	Grethe actually played a major part in convincing the Arbitrage Office that Witches could benefit greatly from collaborating with Behemoths.
%epilogue_friends_348%	So it all worked out well in the end.
%epilogue_friends_351%	Grethe lucked out with what you wrote about Witches relaxing their policies regarding Behemoths.
%epilogue_friends_352%	She was judged, and after she explained all the wisdom she got to access thanks to her dealings with Gaethëryan, they let her go.
%epilogue_friends_353%	That actually set the precedent for starting to judge Behemoths on a case by case basis.
%epilogue_friends_354%	So she's kind of a hero in the eyes of Behemoths now, hah.
%epilogue_friends_357%	Mmm... It's been a long time since I last saw Grethe.
%epilogue_friends_358%	She had to flee after her bold declarations in congress about her dealing with the Behemoth...
%epilogue_friends_359%	And she can't just edit reality to evade answering to the Arbiters as you do.
%epilogue_friends_360%	The thing is that she wasn't doing that bad when I saw her. She welcomed being pushed out of her comfort zone and becoming a fugitive philosopher, haha.
%epilogue_friends_361%	She's completely bonkers, that one.
%epilogue_friends_364%	Having accessed Gaethëryan's wisdom, she's been pretty close with Ábramar lately.
%epilogue_friends_365%	We suspect that soon enough he'll make her his right hand.
%epilogue_friends_366%	Ábramar says it's quite rare to find a Witch who is able to debate certain aspects of unexistence...
%epilogue_friends_367%	In due time, Grethe may be more Behemoth than Witch.
%epilogue_friends_370%	...Oh, you don't know?
%epilogue_friends_371%	Grethe was captured by the Machina Cult.
%epilogue_friends_372%	They learned about her dealings with the Behemoth and decided to go after her.
%epilogue_friends_374%	And since Grethe was fused to Gaethëryan, they managed to override her thoughts.
%epilogue_friends_376%	Now she's like an automaton in the hands of the Machina Cult, helping them build and design factories with her architectural expertise.
%epilogue_friends_377%	Oh, shit... that sucks.
%epilogue_friends_378%	Not a pretty picture, no... Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_friends_381%	And even if she managed to get free from Gaethëryan, in the end, her mind was permanently altered... making it susceptible to the Cult's control device.
%epilogue_friends_384%	I know! How's Grethe?
%epilogue_friends_385%	She's good! She's the fucking best, as always.
%epilogue_friends_386%	She's currently on one of her... thinking escapades.
%epilogue_friends_387%	Grethe carved a shrine with one of the fragments from the House of Cosmic Providence she found floating around in space.
%epilogue_friends_388%	She says this is the one, she's absolutely about to unravel the meaning of life.
%epilogue_friends_389%	But I've heard that like fifty times since we've been together.
%epilogue_friends_390%	It's good to see her so driven, though.
%epilogue_friends_391%	Makes me happy.
%epilogue_friends_392%	Still, she comes to visit me at least once a week.
%epilogue_friends_393%	She's never failed to show up even once since I lost my immortality.
%epilogue_friends_394%	...I love her so much.
%epilogue_friends_395%	...Aw.
%epilogue_friends_396%	I'm so happy you have her.
%epilogue_friends_407%	Ah... I actually miss her.
%epilogue_friends_408%	She seemed happy during her last few years though, next to that rapper.
%epilogue_friends_409%	It's weird, I wrote she was going to fall in love with a poet.
%epilogue_friends_410%	Isn't that the same thing?
%epilogue_friends_411%	How come you didn't go to visit in her last years?
%epilogue_friends_412%	Ah... I couldn't bear to lose her a third time. I mean... come on.
%epilogue_friends_413%	...Fair enough.
%epilogue_friends_416%	Oh, talk about going out in a blaze of glory.
%epilogue_friends_417%	What a shame you didn't come to the last orgy.
%epilogue_friends_418%	Why the fuck would I go to my sister's death orgy.
%epilogue_friends_419%	WAIT.
%epilogue_friends_420%	Did you!?
%epilogue_friends_421%	Hahahaha.
%epilogue_friends_422%	...Yes.
%epilogue_friends_423%	Ew.
%epilogue_friends_424%	Do you want me to tell you about it?
%epilogue_friends_425%	Nope. Next topic, please.
%epilogue_friends_426%	Haha, ok, your loss.
%epilogue_friends_429%	Ah... I actually miss her.
%epilogue_friends_430%	It was really beautiful, the day she ascended to become a goddess of arts and inspiration...
%epilogue_friends_431%	I've never seen a ritual with so many fireworks!
%epilogue_friends_432%	Yeah, the afterparty was legendary too.
%epilogue_friends_433%	Now... I kinda feel her guiding my hand every time I craft a new dagger. It's beautiful.
%epilogue_friends_434%	I've felt her during my card creation too... I hope she's happy as a goddess.
%epilogue_friends_437%	Patrice... no one's going to forget that name for as long as this cosmos exists.
%epilogue_friends_438%	We were barely recovering from the congress catastrophe when she had to go and strike that deal with the Seed of Knowledge.
%epilogue_friends_439%	Half the Witches in the cosmos lost their minds when Patrice opened the gates of wisdom to lost universes.
%epilogue_friends_440%	I barely made it out myself...
%epilogue_friends_441%	Even as a mortal, the images invaded my mind. I think it'll haunt me forever, what I saw...
%epilogue_friends_442%	I... I understand why she had to be executed for it.
%epilogue_friends_443%	The Seed of Knowledge totally took control of her.
%epilogue_friends_444%	Nasty business, yes.
%epilogue_friends_445%	Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_friends_448%	Hey, is your sister's last student still visiting you?
%epilogue_friends_449%	Yes... Not as often as in the beginning but...
%epilogue_friends_450%	Touching the gemstone she turned herself into allows me to dream with her, and talk to her in my dreams.
%epilogue_friends_451%	Her actual self, not a manifestation of my memories.
%epilogue_friends_452%	Her soul is still alive inside that gem.
%epilogue_friends_453%	I would never have thought she would love an apprentice so much as to become a trinket to aid her.
%epilogue_friends_454%	Well, you wrote that... didn't you?
%epilogue_friends_455%	Still. Hard to believe.
%epilogue_friends_456%	I guess...
%epilogue_friends_459%	You and Patrice don't get together much nowadays, right?
%epilogue_friends_460%	No...
%epilogue_friends_461%	Why's that?
%epilogue_friends_462%	She resents me for having condemned her to immortality.
%epilogue_friends_463%	Like... infinite immortality. She'll live as long as this universe.
%epilogue_friends_464%	But... you did that because you love her and you wanted to protect her forever, right?
%epilogue_friends_465%	I guess. But that's not what she wanted.
%epilogue_friends_466%	Plus, there's the irony of granting her an everlasting existence only to forsake my own immortality.
%epilogue_friends_467%	She can't bear to look me in the eye.
%epilogue_friends_468%	I'm sorry to hear that...
%epilogue_friends_469%	It's alright. Let's move on.
%epilogue_friends_472%	I heard Patrice is going to duel another Witch next month.
%epilogue_friends_473%	Yes, and she's going to die.
%epilogue_friends_474%	Oh, shit, right, you wrote that, right?
%epilogue_friends_475%	I'm afraid so.
%epilogue_friends_476%	What are they fighting about?
%epilogue_friends_477%	The most stupid shit a Witch can duel another Witch over:
%epilogue_friends_478%	A man.
%epilogue_friends_479%	Oh, wow. Yeah, that's lame.
%epilogue_friends_480%	A fucking man, can you believe it?
%epilogue_friends_481%	Well, it's her choice.
%epilogue_friends_482%	A fucking man!
%epilogue_friends_483%	Uh... Let's switch gears.
%epilogue_friends_488%	Mmm... You don't talk to Yu-ënia anymore?
%epilogue_friends_489%	We write to each other from time to time. But I haven't seen her since she became independent.
%epilogue_friends_490%	She moved her studio to another dimension and is writing books on the Cosmic Wheel and its malleable properties.
%epilogue_friends_491%	Something tells me you played a great part in inspiring her to pick up this... endeavor.
%epilogue_friends_492%	Yeah... I know she's only doing it to not see me suffer. To see if there's a way we can better control my power and... fix things.
%epilogue_friends_493%	I don't want her doing that. She's wasting her immortality away.
%epilogue_friends_494%	But... we all know there's no way of stopping a driven Witch.
%epilogue_friends_495%	I understand...
%epilogue_friends_496%	Anyway.
%epilogue_friends_507%	Well, I heard Cupressa's happy.
%epilogue_friends_508%	She made her peace with Aedana's death and isn't obsessed with preserving her legacy anymore.
%epilogue_friends_509%	She went to live at the Hundred Column Worship, where she spends all of her time writing biographies on really old Witches.
%epilogue_friends_510%	Would you like me to bring you one of her books?
%epilogue_friends_511%	No thanks.
%epilogue_friends_512%	Ah... haha, ok.
%epilogue_friends_515%	Cupressa has become a really popular teacher among the novices.
%epilogue_friends_516%	For some reason, a lot of Witches want to hear about Aedana's work and miracles.
%epilogue_friends_517%	I'm the reason... I wrote that.
%epilogue_friends_518%	Well, I'd say it's not hurting anyone.
%epilogue_friends_519%	Tsk.
%epilogue_friends_520%	Ok... We don't need to talk about it.
%epilogue_friends_523%	Oh, I came upon Cupressa not long ago.
%epilogue_friends_524%	Her Cult of the Mask Whispers isn't doing any better than it was half a century ago.
%epilogue_friends_525%	Just a bunch of Aedana fans worshiping one of her Golden Maks and pressing their ears against it.
%epilogue_friends_526%	I checked, and it's all hallucinations. The Mask is dead, it doesn't whisper or do anything anymore.
%epilogue_friends_527%	But it makes them happy, I guess.
%epilogue_friends_528%	Anyway.
%epilogue_friends_531%	Uh... It's not pretty with Cupressa.
%epilogue_friends_532%	She just roams the cosmos spouting nonsense.
%epilogue_friends_533%	From time to time some mischievous novices go to prank her, trying to confuse her with weird questions.
%epilogue_friends_534%	She's become some kind of deranged speech generator.
%epilogue_friends_535%	It's ugly... I'm tempted to put her out of her misery.
%epilogue_friends_536%	...But I guess she's not hurting anyone. Not even herself, anymore.
%epilogue_friends_537%	We'd better talk about something else.
%epilogue_friends_540%	The coven has been a mess since Cupressa's victory.
%epilogue_friends_541%	She totally forsook our sisterhood, ignoring all her duties...
%epilogue_friends_542%	But...
%epilogue_friends_546%	I'm feeling a bit tired now. Thanks for coming...
%epilogue_friends_547%	These mortal bones haven't got much rodeo left in them.
%epilogue_friends_548%	Aw... It pains me to see you like this.
%epilogue_friends_549%	Hah... me too.
%epilogue_friends_550%	But it is what it is.
%epilogue_friends_551%	Listen.
%epilogue_friends_552%	I love you two a fucking lot.
%epilogue_friends_553%	I love you too, Forts.
%epilogue_friends_554%	Me too, I love you so much.
%epilogue_friends_555%	Take care alright?
%epilogue_friends_556%	We'll come back soon enough.
%epilogue_friends_557%	If not, consider yourselves invited to my funeral, haha.
%epilogue_friends_558%	Fortuna!
%epilogue_friends_559%	Come on, off you go.
%epilogue_friends_560%	See you in the next life, friend.
%epilogue_friends_561%	Goodbye.
%epilogue_sacrifice_2%	It's been a century now, Fortuna.
%epilogue_sacrifice_4%	...Are you ready to forgive me?
%epilogue_sacrifice_7%	I will never forgive you.
%epilogue_sacrifice_8%	It's myself that I need to forgive.
%epilogue_sacrifice_12%	I will never forgive you.
%epilogue_sacrifice_13%	...
%epilogue_sacrifice_14%	Very well. I'll try again in another century.
%epilogue_sacrifice_16%	In the meantime... Aren't you interested in the latest gossip?
%epilogue_sacrifice_19%	Come on. Leave me alone.
%epilogue_sacrifice_20%	...You have until I finish my tea.
%epilogue_sacrifice_24%	Come on. Leave me alone.
%epilogue_sacrifice_25%	Are you sure?
%epilogue_sacrifice_26%	I've been pretty bored these past few decades. I know pretty much everything that's happened throughout the whole of cosmic society.
%epilogue_sacrifice_29%	Dude. Fuck off. Leave me be.
%epilogue_sacrifice_30%	Fiiine. I'm listening.
%epilogue_sacrifice_34%	Dude. Fuck off. Leave me be.
%epilogue_sacrifice_36%	Ok, ok, I get it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_37%	I'm sorry.
%epilogue_sacrifice_38%	I really hope we can be friends someday, Fortuna.
%epilogue_sacrifice_43%	Fiiine. I'm listening.
%epilogue_sacrifice_46%	...You have until I finish my tea.
%epilogue_sacrifice_50%	It's myself that I need to forgive.
%epilogue_sacrifice_52%	Come on... Don't be so hard on yourself.
%epilogue_sacrifice_53%	We've been over this a million times.
%epilogue_sacrifice_54%	You did what you needed to do to survive.
%epilogue_sacrifice_57%	And even if you couldn't predict how much it'd hurt to lose Patrice...
%epilogue_sacrifice_60%	And even if you couldn't predict how much it'd hurt to lose Grethe...
%epilogue_sacrifice_63%	It's not something you can change now.
%epilogue_sacrifice_64%	The only thing you can do is move forward. Make the most of this life for which you've paid such a high price.
%epilogue_sacrifice_65%	That's enough compassion for today.
%epilogue_sacrifice_66%	Why are you here?
%epilogue_sacrifice_67%	Mmm...
%epilogue_sacrifice_69%	To gossip.
%epilogue_sacrifice_70%	For real?
%epilogue_sacrifice_72%	I've been pretty bored these past few decades. I know pretty much everything that's happened throughout the whole of cosmic society.
%epilogue_sacrifice_73%	I thought you may be interested.
%epilogue_sacrifice_75%	I...
%epilogue_sacrifice_76%	Really miss spending time with you.
%epilogue_sacrifice_79%	I kinda missed you too, yeah...
%epilogue_sacrifice_80%	I'm not really in the mood.
%epilogue_sacrifice_84%	I kinda missed you too, yeah...
%epilogue_sacrifice_86%	Did you, now?
%epilogue_sacrifice_87%	Come on, spit out whatever it is that you came to tell me about.
%epilogue_sacrifice_89%	Hahahaha.
%epilogue_sacrifice_93%	I'm not really in the mood.
%epilogue_sacrifice_95%	Are you sure?
%epilogue_sacrifice_96%	I pretty much know how EVERYONE is doing.
%epilogue_sacrifice_99%	Dude. Fuck off. Leave me be.
%epilogue_sacrifice_100%	Fiiine. I'm listening.
%epilogue_sacrifice_105%	Ah, that's more like it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_107%	Where to begin...
%epilogue_sacrifice_114%	Oh, of course. You'll be happy to know that we finally managed to bring back the last sister who was lost during the congress catastrophe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_115%	It's been a long process, but Zira's jade and quicksilver method has been extremely useful.
%epilogue_sacrifice_118%	Oh, yes. I'm happy to announce that I brought back the last of your lost sisters, as your coven requested.
%epilogue_sacrifice_119%	Soon the time to pay will come but... we don't want to rehash that right now.
%epilogue_sacrifice_122%	Oh! We recovered the last soul that was missing from the congress catastrophe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_123%	Cupressa really did us a solid by sacrificing herself half a century ago. The scattering ceremony was beautiful.
%epilogue_sacrifice_127%	Triggering yet another political race so soon wasn't as nice, though.
%epilogue_sacrifice_128%	You did well to stay out of politics this time.
%epilogue_sacrifice_131%	Oh! Did you know that Jasmine has started manifesting Wunn's powers of entropy?
%epilogue_sacrifice_132%	Splitting the souls of all your sisters between you was quite a wild thing to do.
%epilogue_sacrifice_133%	Have you started tripping yet? Any unexpected powers showing?
%epilogue_sacrifice_134%	Nope, sorry, just really weird dreams.
%epilogue_sacrifice_135%	Bummer.
%epilogue_sacrifice_138%	This part of the galaxy really feels empty with most of your sisters up in that higher place of existence you made for them.
%epilogue_sacrifice_141%	This part of the galaxy really feels empty without the coven around...
%epilogue_sacrifice_144%	Oh! A while ago I encountered Junreisha within the body of a Deerfolk, that was... really uncanny.
%epilogue_sacrifice_145%	Why did you come up with that plan of seizing the bodies of your enemies?
%epilogue_sacrifice_146%	Desperate times call for desperate measures...
%epilogue_sacrifice_147%	Well, it was a bit comedic in its own twisted way.
%epilogue_sacrifice_149%	As for myself...
%epilogue_sacrifice_155%	You really did me a solid with what you wrote about Witches relaxing their policies regarding Behemoths.
%epilogue_sacrifice_156%	Well... the ones who know about the price you had to pay are still quite wary of me...
%epilogue_sacrifice_157%	But I'm not being hunted anymore. That's a massive victory considering my turbulent past.
%epilogue_sacrifice_160%	You really did me a solid with what you wrote about Witches and Behemoths getting to coexist in harmony.
%epilogue_sacrifice_161%	It was about time.
%epilogue_sacrifice_162%	I'm making so many friends... I don't want to make you jealous, but--
%epilogue_sacrifice_163%	You won't.
%epilogue_sacrifice_164%	Ahem... I just love Witches so much. It's great being able to hang out with so many of them without fearing for my life.
%epilogue_sacrifice_168%	You served me your own poetic justice, in the end.
%epilogue_sacrifice_169%	After what happened at the House of Cosmic Providence, covens around the galaxy strengthened their Behemoth policies and...
%epilogue_sacrifice_171%	Let's just say there aren't many corners of this universe I get to chill in anymore.
%epilogue_sacrifice_172%	I'm not only forbidden, I'm being actively hunted now.
%epilogue_sacrifice_175%	As you predicted--or wrote, sorry--the Witches from the Machina Cult created a device to override Behemoth's thoughts.
%epilogue_sacrifice_176%	I know some formidable Behemoths who have been enslaved in the last few decades...
%epilogue_sacrifice_177%	Pray for me.
%epilogue_sacrifice_178%	You are always in my thoughts and prayers.
%epilogue_sacrifice_179%	Ah... sure. Ha, that made me shiver.
%epilogue_sacrifice_182%	I'd never imagined that I would end up having my own coven, to be honest.
%epilogue_sacrifice_183%	Who would have thought that my appearance after the destruction of the House of Cosmic Providence would make such an impact on your sisters.
%epilogue_sacrifice_184%	To the point of deciding to worship me.
%epilogue_sacrifice_185%	Ahem. It's not like it's entirely your merit. I wrote that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_187%	Yeah, yeah, but I'm the one who gets to enjoy it, heh.
%epilogue_sacrifice_193%	Anyway...
%epilogue_sacrifice_198%	I got to meet with Gloria's corpse.
%epilogue_sacrifice_199%	I can't believe she's dead. After existing through so many universes, she just went and quit living.
%epilogue_sacrifice_200%	Makes me wonder what I'm expecting from my existence... and future existences.
%epilogue_sacrifice_202%	In any case, it was a beautiful reunion. She is... was... the best being I've ever encountered in any universe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_203%	Thank you for allowing me to say goodbye to her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_207%	It finally happened.
%epilogue_sacrifice_209%	Some years ago I got to meet Gloria again.
%epilogue_sacrifice_210%	She was more beautiful than ever, as if the cosmos danced around her, the whole universe a mechanism designed to make her glow.
%epilogue_sacrifice_211%	She was happy to see me too... We've been able to enjoy ourselves for a long time now.
%epilogue_sacrifice_212%	I'll be forever in your debt for that, Fortuna.
%epilogue_sacrifice_213%	If only I knew...
%epilogue_sacrifice_214%	I know... I'm sorry. But thank you anyway.
%epilogue_sacrifice_218%	I got to meet with Gloria.
%epilogue_sacrifice_219%	It happened some years ago, but I couldn't muster the courage to tell you about it until now.
%epilogue_sacrifice_221%	You got to break my heart as payback. As you wrote, she didn't love me anymore.
%epilogue_sacrifice_222%	She gave me a dream crystal, containing all the time we spent together, in case I feel like reliving our... adventures.
%epilogue_sacrifice_224%	But... I'm going to miss her so much.
%epilogue_sacrifice_226%	I know, I don't have any right to complain. I just... wanted to tell you about how it went.
%epilogue_sacrifice_229%	I resented you for a long time, for having written that I'll never get to see Gloria again.
%epilogue_sacrifice_230%	And I couldn't have cared less about that "you will find a love greater than hers" bullshit.
%epilogue_sacrifice_231%	But...
%epilogue_sacrifice_232%	It did happen.
%epilogue_sacrifice_233%	I tend to forget how fearsome your powers are.
%epilogue_sacrifice_235%	I...
%epilogue_sacrifice_237%	I'm madly in love.
%epilogue_sacrifice_239%	And this is the weirdest part for me... I fell in love with another Behemoth.
%epilogue_sacrifice_240%	It's the first time in my multiple existences that I liked someone other than a Witch.
%epilogue_sacrifice_241%	And... shit. To connect with someone who knows how it feels to unexist, to peek behind the curtain...
%epilogue_sacrifice_242%	We understand each other so well...
%epilogue_sacrifice_244%	I'm so happy, Fortuna!
%epilogue_sacrifice_245%	Ok, ok, cut it out, will you?
%epilogue_sacrifice_247%	Yes. Sorry. Thank you.
%epilogue_sacrifice_253%	Anyway... Gloria just recently ascended.
%epilogue_sacrifice_254%	Why did you have to turn her into a goddess?
%epilogue_sacrifice_255%	It's not fair. She wasn't part of our game...
%epilogue_sacrifice_256%	What can I say? You're not the only one messing up lives anymore.
%epilogue_sacrifice_257%	Heh... yeah.
%epilogue_sacrifice_259%	Dude, this doesn't feel like gossiping at all.
%epilogue_sacrifice_260%	You're just using me for therapy.
%epilogue_sacrifice_262%	Ah... yes, yes. I can't help but think of you as a friend...
%epilogue_sacrifice_264%	But enough about me!
%epilogue_sacrifice_267%	Who would you like to gossip about?
%epilogue_sacrifice_270%	The coven.
%epilogue_sacrifice_271%	Dahlia.
%epilogue_sacrifice_272%	Jasmine.
%epilogue_sacrifice_273%	Grethe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_274%	My sister Patrice.
%epilogue_sacrifice_275%	Yu-ënia, my mentor.
%epilogue_sacrifice_276%	Cupressa.
%epilogue_sacrifice_277%	Look at the time! Don't you have somewhere else to be?
%epilogue_sacrifice_290%	Well, she's doing fine.
%epilogue_sacrifice_291%	Since the catastrophe she's retired completely from any form of politics.
%epilogue_sacrifice_292%	She started her own hunting guild and they take on huge cosmic beasts.
%epilogue_sacrifice_293%	...They even managed to take down a rogue Behemoth. Scary shit.
%epilogue_sacrifice_297%	She ended up marrying a Daemon, can you believe it?
%epilogue_sacrifice_298%	Now the Daemon acts as an informant on the dealings of their own kind. I have zero respect for that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_299%	Although... such a massive betrayal is a pretty daemonic thing to do.
%epilogue_sacrifice_303%	Well... she died a decade ago.
%epilogue_sacrifice_304%	Yes, I wrote that. One more thing I'm never going to be able to forgive myself for...
%epilogue_sacrifice_305%	Poor Dahlia, she didn't deserve that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_307%	Come on, you read that back when you were unaware of the true nature of your arts.
%epilogue_sacrifice_309%	...Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_sacrifice_313%	In any case, finding a successor to continue Dahlia's leadership hasn't been as gruesome as our infamous congress thing.
%epilogue_sacrifice_314%	Since Dahlia was aware of the proximity of her death, she trained a successor and surprisingly the coven has had no problem accepting her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_315%	I'm sure it has to do with the fact that most of the Witches of the coven are now women who ascended thanks to Dahlia's efforts to scatter Aedana's remains.
%epilogue_sacrifice_316%	I'm going to miss her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_317%	...Yeah, me too.
%epilogue_sacrifice_320%	With Dahlia's death, your old sisterhood is officially over.
%epilogue_sacrifice_321%	No more Witches are ascending since you cast that extinction future over cosmic society.
%epilogue_sacrifice_322%	Good.
%epilogue_sacrifice_323%	Harsh.
%epilogue_sacrifice_324%	Let's change the mood...
%epilogue_sacrifice_328%	Dahlia's glowing. It's been hard to rebuild the coven after the congress catastrophe, but...
%epilogue_sacrifice_329%	Dahlia's good. Not only for the coven, for the whole of cosmic society.
%epilogue_sacrifice_330%	Ironically enough for a warrior Witch, her system's brought unprecedented levels of peace to the whole universe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_331%	Even with your old sisterhood being a shadow of what it was, it's respected and copied throughout many covens.
%epilogue_sacrifice_332%	That's good, I guess...
%epilogue_sacrifice_333%	You don't sound too chipper about it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_334%	Yes, no... It's just one of those days.
%epilogue_sacrifice_335%	Ok, let's change the subject.
%epilogue_sacrifice_338%	Well, the coven dissolved about a decade ago and she's still blaming herself.
%epilogue_sacrifice_339%	I told her a hundred times that I was the one who wrote this bleak future.
%epilogue_sacrifice_340%	I guess that blaming oneself is less painful than accepting that your whole life has been puppeteered by a single card.
%epilogue_sacrifice_341%	When you put it that way... yeah.
%epilogue_sacrifice_342%	Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_sacrifice_346%	Well, you tell me.
%epilogue_sacrifice_347%	You still haven't introduced me to Larissa.
%epilogue_sacrifice_348%	You three have been all buddy-buddy with her since you met her a couple of decades ago.
%epilogue_sacrifice_349%	Oh, yeah! Writing that fourth Witch into our group was the best thing I've done in my whole life.
%epilogue_sacrifice_351%	She's the best, did you know she was a marketing director back on Earth?
%epilogue_sacrifice_354%	She's the best, did you know she was a marketing director on Mars?
%epilogue_sacrifice_356%	In the short time she's been a Witch she's discovered so many great joints throughout the galaxy to go and have a good time.
%epilogue_sacrifice_357%	She's still amazed by Witches' capacity to not get hungover at all, haha.
%epilogue_sacrifice_358%	Come on! That's not fair, I want to meet her too!
%epilogue_sacrifice_359%	No. She's mine.
%epilogue_sacrifice_360%	Bah.
%epilogue_sacrifice_361%	Whatever.
%epilogue_sacrifice_366%	Well, you tell me. Since you left the coven you three have been pretty hermetic.
%epilogue_sacrifice_367%	I want in on the fun too!
%epilogue_sacrifice_368%	No way. What we have now is just too good to let a dangerous Behemoth in.
%epilogue_sacrifice_369%	Dangerous!?
%epilogue_sacrifice_370%	Ábramar...
%epilogue_sacrifice_371%	Ok, yes, you're right.
%epilogue_sacrifice_372%	What have you been up to, though?
%epilogue_sacrifice_373%	Well, surprise: just living!
%epilogue_sacrifice_374%	You don't need to be in a massive sisterhood to be happy or fulfilled. I feel like an idiot for having taken such a long time to realize that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_375%	Why the hell did I put up with Aedana's bullshit for so long?
%epilogue_sacrifice_376%	Being independent is the best. A coven of three is the way to be. A family.
%epilogue_sacrifice_377%	It's not fair! I want in!!
%epilogue_sacrifice_378%	Fuck off.
%epilogue_sacrifice_379%	Very well...
%epilogue_sacrifice_381%	Moving on.
%epilogue_sacrifice_384%	Anyway, about Dahlia:
%epilogue_sacrifice_385%	She ended up marrying that Daemon I made up with my cards back when I "read" her past, can you believe it?
%epilogue_sacrifice_386%	Now the Daemon acts as an informant on the dealings of their own kind. I have zero respect for that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_387%	Although... such a massive betrayal is a pretty daemonic thing to do.
%epilogue_sacrifice_388%	Wow.
%epilogue_sacrifice_389%	Yup. Wow.
%epilogue_sacrifice_407%	Jasmine hasn't been herself of late.
%epilogue_sacrifice_408%	After her garden withered and died she's been pretty aimless.
%epilogue_sacrifice_410%	I just hope she finds something that drives her soon enough, or I see her turning into a corpse sooner or later.
%epilogue_sacrifice_411%	Oof... That's harsh. I was hoping for her to emerge renewed from this, but...
%epilogue_sacrifice_412%	Yeah, it's tough shit.
%epilogue_sacrifice_413%	Let's lighten the mood.
%epilogue_sacrifice_416%	From what I know, Jasmine's doing amazing.
%epilogue_sacrifice_417%	As you "foretold," her garden grew beyond her wildest expectations. She's now a mentor to many producers from all corners of the cosmos.
%epilogue_sacrifice_418%	Her gardening dojo is practically an institution of its own nowadays.
%epilogue_sacrifice_420%	Good for her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_423%	Jasmine's barely a Witch anymore. She's... something greater. Scarier even, I'd say.
%epilogue_sacrifice_424%	Ever since she merged with her garden she gives me more of a Behemoth vibe than a Witch one.
%epilogue_sacrifice_425%	She's extremely cool, though.
%epilogue_sacrifice_426%	I bet she is.
%epilogue_sacrifice_427%	Anyway.
%epilogue_sacrifice_430%	Jasmine hasn't been herself of late.
%epilogue_sacrifice_431%	After her garden was taken from her to be exploited by that new Deerfolk Cult... she's been pretty aimless.
%epilogue_sacrifice_434%	As you "predicted," that cosmic plague hit not only your coven but the whole of cosmic society pretty hard. But thanks to Jasmine's efforts, everyone's alright.
%epilogue_sacrifice_435%	She's now revered as some kind of hero.
%epilogue_sacrifice_436%	So I'd say she's doing pretty good.
%epilogue_sacrifice_439%	Jasmine's hands are full training her sentient garden nowadays.
%epilogue_sacrifice_440%	She gives off this motherly aura, full of pride for what her... mmm... "creature" is achieving.
%epilogue_sacrifice_441%	So far about a dozen barren moons have become lush gardens and forests thanks to Jasmine's sentient garden's blessing.
%epilogue_sacrifice_442%	Whoa.
%epilogue_sacrifice_443%	Is it weird to feel proud for having written that?
%epilogue_sacrifice_444%	The moral quandaries of your arts will always be beyond me, really.
%epilogue_sacrifice_445%	Fair enough.
%epilogue_sacrifice_448%	Jasmine has her hands full with what remains of the Jade Sculptors.
%epilogue_sacrifice_449%	As you wrote, they've become addicted to Jasmine's mixtures... apparently it allows them to connect with the Jade Monks in the astral plane.
%epilogue_sacrifice_450%	So... Jasmine is some kind of prophet for them now.
%epilogue_sacrifice_451%	I wouldn't like to be in her shoes.
%epilogue_sacrifice_452%	I feel you.
%epilogue_sacrifice_453%	Anyway.
%epilogue_sacrifice_457%	Well, I wasn't exactly rooting for Jasmine, but her mandate has been surprisingly effective.
%epilogue_sacrifice_458%	And even with how hard it's been to rebuild the coven... Your old sisterhood has become an institution throughout the galaxy.
%epilogue_sacrifice_459%	Jasmine's judgment is so revered that she's mediating in other coven's issues, too. She pulls the strings of most of cosmic society from her humble throne.
%epilogue_sacrifice_460%	Good for her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_463%	You created a monster, Fortuna.
%epilogue_sacrifice_464%	In her effort to rebuild the sisterhood, Jasmine's been conquering other covens to increase your numbers.
%epilogue_sacrifice_465%	In the beginning it was just... aggressive negotiations, to get smaller communities to join her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_466%	But the last couple of decades have been all-out war campaigns. The last to join was the Machina Cult.
%epilogue_sacrifice_467%	And... I don't even want to know what Jasmine's planning to do with all their firepower.
%epilogue_sacrifice_468%	Ah...
%epilogue_sacrifice_471%	Anyway, remember that thing you read about Jasmine's garden?
%epilogue_sacrifice_475%	Well, you tell me.
%epilogue_sacrifice_476%	You still haven't introduced me to Larissa.
%epilogue_sacrifice_477%	You've been all buddy-buddy with her since you met her a couple of decades ago.
%epilogue_sacrifice_478%	Oh, yeah! Writing that fourth Witch into our group was the best thing I've done in my whole life.
%epilogue_sacrifice_480%	She's the best, did you know she was a marketing director back on Earth?
%epilogue_sacrifice_483%	She's the best, did you know she was a marketing director on Mars?
%epilogue_sacrifice_485%	In the short time she's been a Witch she's discovered so many great joints throughout the galaxy to go and have a good time.
%epilogue_sacrifice_486%	She's still amazed by Witches' capacity to not get hungover at all, haha.
%epilogue_sacrifice_487%	Come on! That's not fair, I want to meet her too!
%epilogue_sacrifice_488%	No. She's mine.
%epilogue_sacrifice_489%	Bah.
%epilogue_sacrifice_490%	Whatever.
%epilogue_sacrifice_494%	Well, you tell me. Since you left the coven you've been pretty hermetic.
%epilogue_sacrifice_495%	I want in on the fun too!
%epilogue_sacrifice_496%	No way. What we have now is just too good to let a dangerous Behemoth in.
%epilogue_sacrifice_497%	Dangerous!?
%epilogue_sacrifice_498%	Ábramar...
%epilogue_sacrifice_499%	Ok, yes, you're right.
%epilogue_sacrifice_500%	What have you been up to, though?
%epilogue_sacrifice_501%	Well, surprise: just living!
%epilogue_sacrifice_502%	You don't need to be in a massive sisterhood to be happy or fulfilled. I feel like an idiot for having taken such a long time to realize that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_503%	Why the hell did I put up with Aedana's bullshit for so long?
%epilogue_sacrifice_504%	Being independent is the best. A coven of three is the way to be. A family.
%epilogue_sacrifice_506%	It's not fair! I want in!!
%epilogue_sacrifice_507%	Fuck off.
%epilogue_sacrifice_508%	Very well...
%epilogue_sacrifice_510%	Moving on.
%epilogue_sacrifice_513%	Well, two now, since Dahlia died...
%epilogue_sacrifice_514%	I'm never going to get used to her not being with us...
%epilogue_sacrifice_516%	Yeah... the universe misses her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_518%	Let's not dwell on that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_527%	She's lucky you wrote that Behemoths and Witches would get to coexist in harmony.
%epilogue_sacrifice_528%	Because after her declarations in congress... Well, it was either cosmic erasure or this.
%epilogue_sacrifice_529%	They kept her prisoner for a while in the Arbitrage Office, but later it was decided that Behemoths weren't a threat, per se.
%epilogue_sacrifice_530%	Grethe actually played a major part in convincing the Arbitrage Office that Witches could benefit greatly from collaborating with Behemoths.
%epilogue_sacrifice_531%	So it all worked out well in the end.
%epilogue_sacrifice_534%	Grethe lucked out with what you wrote about Witches relaxing their policies regarding Behemoths.
%epilogue_sacrifice_535%	She was judged, and after she explained all the wisdom she got to access thanks to her dealing with Gaethëryan, they let her go.
%epilogue_sacrifice_536%	That actually set the precedent for starting to judge Behemoths on a case by case basis.
%epilogue_sacrifice_537%	So she's kind of a hero in the eyes of Behemoths now, hah.
%epilogue_sacrifice_540%	Mmm... It's been a long time since I last saw Grethe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_541%	She had to flee after her bold declarations in congress about her dealing with the Behemoth...
%epilogue_sacrifice_542%	And she can't just edit reality to evade answering to the Arbiters as you do.
%epilogue_sacrifice_543%	The thing is that she wasn't doing badly when I saw her. She welcomed being pushed out of her comfort zone and becoming a fugitive philosopher, haha.
%epilogue_sacrifice_544%	She's completely bonkers, that one.
%epilogue_sacrifice_547%	Having accessed Gaethëryan's wisdom, she's been a great conversation partner lately.
%epilogue_sacrifice_548%	I think that soon enough I'll make her my right hand.
%epilogue_sacrifice_549%	It's rare to find a Witch who is able to debate certain aspects of unexistence...
%epilogue_sacrifice_550%	A true gift from the cosmos, that one.
%epilogue_sacrifice_553%	...Oh, you don't know?
%epilogue_sacrifice_554%	Grethe was captured by the Machina Cult.
%epilogue_sacrifice_555%	They learned about her dealings with the Behemoth, and decided to go after her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_557%	And since Grethe was fused to Gaethëryan they've managed to override her thoughts.
%epilogue_sacrifice_559%	Now she's like an automaton in the hands of the Machina Cult, helping them build and design factories with her architectural expertise.
%epilogue_sacrifice_562%	And even if she managed to get free from Gaethëryan, in the end her mind was permanently altered... making it susceptible to the Cult's control device.
%epilogue_sacrifice_573%	Ah... I actually miss her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_574%	She seemed happy during her last few years though, next to that rapper.
%epilogue_sacrifice_575%	It's weird, I wrote she was going to fall in love with a poet.
%epilogue_sacrifice_576%	Come on, same thing.
%epilogue_sacrifice_577%	How come you didn't go to visit in her last years?
%epilogue_sacrifice_578%	Ah... I couldn't bear to lose her a third time, come on.
%epilogue_sacrifice_579%	Fair enough.
%epilogue_sacrifice_582%	Oh, shit, I miss Patrice so much.
%epilogue_sacrifice_583%	What a shame you didn't come to the last orgy.
%epilogue_sacrifice_584%	Why the fuck would I go to my sister's death orgy, dude.
%epilogue_sacrifice_585%	WAIT.
%epilogue_sacrifice_586%	Did you!?
%epilogue_sacrifice_588%	HAHAHAHA.
%epilogue_sacrifice_590%	I would never have missed that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_591%	Dude. Ew. Come on.
%epilogue_sacrifice_593%	Do you want me to tell you about it?
%epilogue_sacrifice_594%	No. Next topic, please.
%epilogue_sacrifice_595%	Your loss.
%epilogue_sacrifice_598%	Ah... I actually miss her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_599%	It was really beautiful, the day she ascended to become a goddess of arts and inspiration...
%epilogue_sacrifice_600%	I've never seen a ritual with so many fireworks!
%epilogue_sacrifice_602%	And I've been to the Big Bang, hahahaha.
%epilogue_sacrifice_604%	I felt her lately guiding my hand during my card creation... I hope she's happy as a goddess.
%epilogue_sacrifice_607%	Patrice... no one's going to forget that name for as long as this cosmos exists.
%epilogue_sacrifice_608%	We were barely recovering from the congress catastrophe when she had to go and strike that deal with the Seed of Knowledge.
%epilogue_sacrifice_609%	Half the Witches in this cosmos lost their minds when Patrice opened the gates of wisdom to lost universes.
%epilogue_sacrifice_610%	I barely made it out myself...
%epilogue_sacrifice_611%	I think it'll haunt me forever, what I saw...
%epilogue_sacrifice_612%	I... I understand why she had to be executed for it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_613%	The Seed of Knowledge totally took control of her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_614%	Nasty business, yes.
%epilogue_sacrifice_615%	Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_sacrifice_618%	Are you still visiting your sister's last student?
%epilogue_sacrifice_619%	Yes... Not as often as in the beginning but...
%epilogue_sacrifice_620%	Touching the gemstone she turned herself into allows me to dream with her, and talk to her in my dreams.
%epilogue_sacrifice_621%	Her actual self, not a manifestation of my memories.
%epilogue_sacrifice_622%	Her soul is still alive inside that gem.
%epilogue_sacrifice_623%	I would never have thought she would love an apprentice so much as to become a trinket to aid her.
%epilogue_sacrifice_624%	Well, you wrote it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_625%	Still. Hard to believe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_626%	I guess.
%epilogue_sacrifice_629%	You and Patrice don't get together much nowadays, right?
%epilogue_sacrifice_630%	No...
%epilogue_sacrifice_631%	Why's that?
%epilogue_sacrifice_632%	She resents me for having condemned her to immortality.
%epilogue_sacrifice_633%	Like... infinite immortality, she'll live as long as this universe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_634%	Hah, come on, that's a breeze. Do you want me to meet her and cheer her up?
%epilogue_sacrifice_635%	...Would you?
%epilogue_sacrifice_636%	Of course. I know a thing or two about outliving a universe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_637%	Thank you.
%epilogue_sacrifice_638%	Of course.
%epilogue_sacrifice_639%	Now...
%epilogue_sacrifice_642%	I heard Patrice is going to duel another Witch next month.
%epilogue_sacrifice_643%	Yes, and she's going to die.
%epilogue_sacrifice_644%	Oh, shit, right, you wrote that, right?
%epilogue_sacrifice_645%	I'm afraid so.
%epilogue_sacrifice_646%	What are they fighting about?
%epilogue_sacrifice_647%	The most stupid shit a Witch can duel another Witch over:
%epilogue_sacrifice_648%	A man.
%epilogue_sacrifice_650%	Hahahahaha.
%epilogue_sacrifice_651%	A fucking man, can you believe it?
%epilogue_sacrifice_653%	Well, it's her choice.
%epilogue_sacrifice_654%	A fucking man!
%epilogue_sacrifice_655%	Uh... Let's switch gears.
%epilogue_sacrifice_660%	You don't talk to Yu-ënia anymore?
%epilogue_sacrifice_661%	We write to each other from time to time. But I haven't seen her since she became independent.
%epilogue_sacrifice_662%	She moved her studio to another dimension and writes books on the Cosmic Wheel and its malleable properties.
%epilogue_sacrifice_663%	Something tells me you played a great part in inspiring her to pick up this... endeavor.
%epilogue_sacrifice_664%	Yeah... I know she's only doing it to not see me suffer. To see if there's a way we can better control my power and... fix things.
%epilogue_sacrifice_665%	I don't want her doing that. She's wasting her immortality away.
%epilogue_sacrifice_666%	But... we all know there's no way of stopping a driven Witch.
%epilogue_sacrifice_667%	Hear hear.
%epilogue_sacrifice_668%	Anyway.
%epilogue_sacrifice_679%	Well, I heard Cupressa's happy.
%epilogue_sacrifice_680%	She made her peace with Aedana's death and isn't obsessed with preserving her legacy anymore.
%epilogue_sacrifice_681%	She went to live at the Hundred Column Worship, where she spends all of her time writing biographies on really old Witches.
%epilogue_sacrifice_682%	You could pay her a visit.
%epilogue_sacrifice_683%	No thanks.
%epilogue_sacrifice_684%	Heh.
%epilogue_sacrifice_687%	Cupressa has become a really popular teacher among the novices.
%epilogue_sacrifice_688%	For some reason, a lot of Witches from your coven and others want to hear about Aedana's work and miracles.
%epilogue_sacrifice_689%	I'm the reason... I wrote that.
%epilogue_sacrifice_690%	Well, I'd say it's not hurting anyone.
%epilogue_sacrifice_691%	Tsk.
%epilogue_sacrifice_692%	We don't need to talk about it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_695%	I spied on Cupressa recently.
%epilogue_sacrifice_696%	Her Cult of the Mask Whispers isn't doing any better than it was a century ago.
%epilogue_sacrifice_697%	Just a bunch of Aedana fans worshiping one of her Golden Masks and pressing their ears against it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_698%	I checked, and it's all hallucinations. The Mask is dead, it doesn't whisper or do anything anymore.
%epilogue_sacrifice_699%	But it makes them happy, I guess.
%epilogue_sacrifice_702%	Uh... It's not pretty with Cupressa.
%epilogue_sacrifice_703%	She just roams the cosmos spouting nonsense.
%epilogue_sacrifice_704%	From time to time some mischievous novices go to prank her, trying to confuse her with weird questions.
%epilogue_sacrifice_705%	She's become some kind of deranged speech generator.
%epilogue_sacrifice_706%	I'm tempted to put her out of her misery.
%epilogue_sacrifice_707%	...But I guess she's not hurting anyone. Not even herself, anymore.
%epilogue_sacrifice_710%	The coven has been a mess since Cupressa's victory.
%epilogue_sacrifice_711%	She totally forsook the sisterhood, ignoring all her duties...
%epilogue_sacrifice_712%	But...
%epilogue_sacrifice_718%	You want to talk about the coven, like in general?
%epilogue_sacrifice_719%	From my perspective, you did a great job with the sisterhood.
%epilogue_sacrifice_720%	After the blow from the catastrophe at the congress the coven is a shadow of what it used to be under Aedana's control...
%epilogue_sacrifice_721%	But everyone looks... happier, after the work you put in.
%epilogue_sacrifice_722%	And I'd say that's pretty much the point of existing.
%epilogue_sacrifice_723%	Take it from someone who's existed many times now.
%epilogue_sacrifice_724%	Heh... Ok, I'll take the win. Thank you.
%epilogue_sacrifice_728%	It's a pity that you had to sacrifice your friendship with Jasmine and Dahlia but...
%epilogue_sacrifice_729%	Hey, you wrote that for yourself, so I guess you're alright with it?
%epilogue_sacrifice_730%	I'm not... happy about it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_731%	I don't fully control my cartomancy... Sometimes it's like a bigger force wants to see me suffer.
%epilogue_sacrifice_732%	Yeah, you've mentioned that several times. Someday we should look into it.
%epilogue_sacrifice_733%	Ah... I'd rather leave that force undisturbed... sounds like something we shouldn't really be messing with.
%epilogue_sacrifice_734%	Alright... Your call.
%epilogue_sacrifice_737%	What do you want me to say about the coven?
%epilogue_sacrifice_738%	Or is it that you want me to sing your praises?
%epilogue_sacrifice_739%	Oh, founder of the ultimate philosophy, copied throughout almost every coven in this universe.
%epilogue_sacrifice_740%	Yes. Keep it coming.
%epilogue_sacrifice_742%	Hahahahaha.
%epilogue_sacrifice_743%	You're nuts, fuck off. Hahaha.
%epilogue_sacrifice_744%	Alright, alright...
%epilogue_sacrifice_746%	Now...
%epilogue_sacrifice_750%	Look at the time! Don't you have somewhere else to be?
%epilogue_sacrifice_751%	Wow. Rude.
%epilogue_sacrifice_752%	Baby steps, Ábramar.
%epilogue_sacrifice_753%	I'm not ready to be friends... I'm not sure if I ever will be.
%epilogue_sacrifice_754%	So let's take it easy, alright?
%epilogue_sacrifice_756%	...
%epilogue_sacrifice_757%	I understand.
%epilogue_sacrifice_762%	By the way, when is that all-out cosmic war you wrote going to happen?
%epilogue_sacrifice_763%	It's been a century and there's no sign of an intergalactic conflict cooking.
%epilogue_sacrifice_764%	Who knows. It took two centuries for my prediction about the coven falling to happen.
%epilogue_sacrifice_765%	There's plenty of time for things to get messed up.
%epilogue_sacrifice_767%	...I see. You're right.
%epilogue_sacrifice_768%	Not that I'm looking forward to it or anything. I just wanted a little heads up.
%epilogue_sacrifice_771%	Please, let me know if you ever want to meet up again.
%epilogue_sacrifice_772%	I will.
%epilogue_sacrifice_773%	Goodbye, Ábramar.
%epilogue_sacrifice_774%	Goodbye, Fortuna.
%epilogue_servitude_5%	Kneel before your master!
%epilogue_servitude_6%	It's been a century now... Are you going to keep doing the same bit every time you come visit?
%epilogue_servitude_8%	Hahahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_11%	Sorry, owning a coven is never going to get old.
%epilogue_servitude_14%	I salute you, fearsome leader.
%epilogue_servitude_15%	A hundred fucking years and you're still calling me that?
%epilogue_servitude_17%	Hahahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_18%	I'm the leader of nothing, you own our asses.
%epilogue_servitude_21%	What are you up to?
%epilogue_servitude_22%	Hah, you got bored of micromanaging the coven at last?
%epilogue_servitude_23%	Hey, I do not micromanage.
%epilogue_servitude_24%	I just happen to have a lot of opinions.
%epilogue_servitude_25%	And yes, I'm bored.
%epilogue_servitude_26%	I see. So what do you want? Shall I use my deck to find you a date?
%epilogue_servitude_28%	Hahahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_30%	You never fail to amuse me.
%epilogue_servitude_32%	I don't want anything in particular.
%epilogue_servitude_33%	Just wanted to catch up. A friendly chat.
%epilogue_servitude_36%	I may serve you, but I'll never call you my friend.
%epilogue_servitude_37%	Sure. What's new?
%epilogue_servitude_41%	Sure. What's up?
%epilogue_servitude_42%	Mmm... Many things.
%epilogue_servitude_46%	I may serve you, but I'll never call you my friend.
%epilogue_servitude_47%	Ouch.
%epilogue_servitude_49%	It's been a century now, come on. Can't you forgive me?
%epilogue_servitude_52%	I will never forgive you.
%epilogue_servitude_53%	It's myself that I need to forgive.
%epilogue_servitude_57%	I will never forgive you.
%epilogue_servitude_58%	Ok...
%epilogue_servitude_60%	I'll ask again in another century, then.
%epilogue_servitude_61%	Aren't you interested in the latest gossip anyway?
%epilogue_servitude_64%	Come on. Leave me alone.
%epilogue_servitude_65%	...You have until I finish my tea.
%epilogue_servitude_69%	Come on. Leave me alone.
%epilogue_servitude_70%	Are you sure?
%epilogue_servitude_71%	I've been pretty busy these past few decades, I know pretty much everything that's happened throughout the whole of cosmic society.
%epilogue_servitude_74%	Dude. Fuck off. Leave me be.
%epilogue_servitude_75%	Fiiine. I'm listening.
%epilogue_servitude_79%	Dude. Fuck off. Leave me be.
%epilogue_servitude_81%	Ok, ok, I get it.
%epilogue_servitude_82%	I'm sorry.
%epilogue_servitude_83%	I really hope we can be friends someday, Fortuna.
%epilogue_servitude_88%	Fiiine. I'm listening.
%epilogue_servitude_91%	...You have until I finish my tea.
%epilogue_servitude_95%	It's myself that I need to forgive.
%epilogue_servitude_97%	Come on... Don't be so hard on yourself.
%epilogue_servitude_98%	We've been over this a million times.
%epilogue_servitude_100%	You did what you needed to do to survive.
%epilogue_servitude_102%	And it's not like all you Witches are suffering under my tender loving care, are you?
%epilogue_servitude_103%	I'd say you've done pretty well.
%epilogue_servitude_104%	But I sold all my sisters without their consent...
%epilogue_servitude_105%	It doesn't matter to whom or how well they're doing... they didn't get to choose their master.
%epilogue_servitude_107%	Nah... they'll get over it.
%epilogue_servitude_108%	The only thing you can do now is move forward. Make the most of this life for which you've paid such a high price.
%epilogue_servitude_109%	Ok, that's enough compassion for today.
%epilogue_servitude_110%	Why are you here?
%epilogue_servitude_111%	Mmm...
%epilogue_servitude_113%	To gossip.
%epilogue_servitude_114%	For real?
%epilogue_servitude_116%	I've been pretty busy these past few decades. I know pretty much everything that's happened throughout the whole of cosmic society.
%epilogue_servitude_117%	I thought you may be interested.
%epilogue_servitude_119%	I...
%epilogue_servitude_120%	Really miss spending time with you.
%epilogue_servitude_123%	I kinda missed you too, yeah...
%epilogue_servitude_124%	I'm not really in the mood.
%epilogue_servitude_128%	I kinda missed you too, yeah...
%epilogue_servitude_130%	Did you, now?
%epilogue_servitude_131%	Come on, spit out whatever it is that you came to tell me about.
%epilogue_servitude_133%	Hahahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_137%	I'm not really in the mood.
%epilogue_servitude_139%	Are you sure?
%epilogue_servitude_140%	I pretty much know how EVERYONE is doing.
%epilogue_servitude_143%	Dude. Fuck off. Leave me be.
%epilogue_servitude_144%	Fiiine. I'm listening.
%epilogue_servitude_149%	Ah, that's more like it.
%epilogue_servitude_152%	Where to begin...
%epilogue_servitude_159%	Oh, of course. You'll be happy to know that we finally managed to bring back the last sister who was lost during the congress catastrophe.
%epilogue_servitude_160%	It's been a long process, but Zira's jade and quicksilver method has been extremely useful.
%epilogue_servitude_163%	Oh, yes. I'm happy to announce that I brought back the last of your lost sisters, as the coven requested.
%epilogue_servitude_164%	Soon the time to pay will come but... we don't want to rehash that right now.
%epilogue_servitude_165%	Didn't they already pay by serving you?
%epilogue_servitude_166%	Oh no. That was the price for your freedom and your beautiful new deck.
%epilogue_servitude_167%	But seriously, don't fret. I'm dealing with this with your elders.
%epilogue_servitude_170%	Oh! We recovered the last soul that was missing from the congress catastrophe.
%epilogue_servitude_171%	Cupressa really did us a solid by sacrificing herself half a century ago. The scattering ceremony was beautiful.
%epilogue_servitude_175%	Triggering yet another political race so soon wasn't as nice, though.
%epilogue_servitude_176%	You did well to stay out of politics this time.
%epilogue_servitude_177%	Aren't you the ruler of the coven, though?
%epilogue_servitude_178%	I'm like... the owner. But we still need management here, Fortuna.
%epilogue_servitude_179%	Ugh...
%epilogue_servitude_180%	Everything is going to be alright.
%epilogue_servitude_183%	Oh! Did you know that Jasmine has started manifesting Wunn's powers of entropy?
%epilogue_servitude_184%	Splitting the souls of all the sisters between you was quite a wild thing to do.
%epilogue_servitude_185%	Have you started tripping yet? Any unexpected powers showing?
%epilogue_servitude_186%	Nope, sorry, just really weird dreams.
%epilogue_servitude_187%	Bummer.
%epilogue_servitude_190%	This part of the galaxy really feels empty with most of your sisters up in that higher place of existence you made for them.
%epilogue_servitude_191%	And you left me with quite a meager coven in my possession...
%epilogue_servitude_193%	Fuck you.
%epilogue_servitude_194%	Yeah, yeah, sorry...
%epilogue_servitude_197%	This part of the galaxy feels empty without the coven around...
%epilogue_servitude_198%	You really shouldn't have paid with your whole coven to access my powers.
%epilogue_servitude_201%	Oh! A while ago I encountered Junreisha within the body of a Deerfolk, that was... really uncanny.
%epilogue_servitude_202%	Why did you come up with that plan of seizing the bodies of your enemies?
%epilogue_servitude_203%	Desperate times call for desperate measures...
%epilogue_servitude_204%	It's really weird to own a coven of Witches possessing other people's bodies.
%epilogue_servitude_205%	Pretty dark, Fortuna.
%epilogue_servitude_206%	What do you want me to say?
%epilogue_servitude_207%	I don't know. It's all good, I guess.
%epilogue_servitude_209%	As for myself...
%epilogue_servitude_215%	You really did me a solid with what you wrote about Witches relaxing their policies regarding Behemoths.
%epilogue_servitude_216%	Well... the ones who know about the price you had to pay are still quite wary of me...
%epilogue_servitude_217%	But I'm not being hunted anymore. That's a massive victory considering my turbulent past.
%epilogue_servitude_218%	And pretty convenient as the ruler of a coven, to be honest.
%epilogue_servitude_221%	You really did me a solid with what you wrote about Witches and Behemoths getting to coexist in harmony.
%epilogue_servitude_222%	It was about time.
%epilogue_servitude_223%	I'm making so many friends... I don't want to make you jealous, but--
%epilogue_servitude_224%	You won't.
%epilogue_servitude_225%	Ahem... I just love Witches so much. It's great being able to hang out with so many of them without fearing for my life.
%epilogue_servitude_226%	And it's pretty convenient as the ruler of a coven, I don't know how we'd have dealt with all this otherwise.
%epilogue_servitude_230%	You served me your own poetic justice, in the end.
%epilogue_servitude_231%	After what happened at the House of Cosmic Providence, covens around the galaxy strengthened their Behemoth policies and...
%epilogue_servitude_233%	Let's say there aren't many corners of this universe I get to chill in anymore.
%epilogue_servitude_234%	I'm not only forbidden, I'm being actively hunted now.
%epilogue_servitude_235%	You'd better pray no one catches wind that you and your sisters are in fact my servants. Things may get ugly for the lot of you.
%epilogue_servitude_238%	As you predicted--or wrote, sorry--the Witches from the Machina Cult created a device to override Behemoth's thoughts.
%epilogue_servitude_239%	I know some formidable Behemoths who have been enslaved in the last few decades...
%epilogue_servitude_240%	Pray for me.
%epilogue_servitude_241%	You are always in my thoughts and prayers.
%epilogue_servitude_242%	Ah... sure. Ha, that made me shiver.
%epilogue_servitude_243%	My heart rests easy though, knowing that I have my whole coven to protect me, hehe.
%epilogue_servitude_246%	I never imagined I'd end up having my own coven, to be honest.
%epilogue_servitude_247%	Who would have thought that my appearance after the destruction of the House of Cosmic Providence would make such an impact on your sisters.
%epilogue_servitude_248%	To the point of deciding to worship me.
%epilogue_servitude_249%	Ahem. It's not like it's entirely your merit. I wrote that.
%epilogue_servitude_251%	Yeah, yeah, but I'm the one who gets to enjoy it, heh.
%epilogue_servitude_257%	Anyway...
%epilogue_servitude_262%	I got to meet with Gloria's corpse.
%epilogue_servitude_263%	I can't believe she's dead. After existing through so many universes, she just went and quit living.
%epilogue_servitude_264%	Makes me wonder what I'm expecting from my existence... and future existences.
%epilogue_servitude_266%	In any case, it was a beautiful reunion. She is... was... the best being I've ever encountered in any universe.
%epilogue_servitude_267%	Thank you for allowing me to say goodbye to her.
%epilogue_servitude_271%	It finally happened.
%epilogue_servitude_273%	Some years ago I got to meet Gloria again.
%epilogue_servitude_274%	She was more beautiful than ever, as if the cosmos danced around her, the whole universe a mechanism designed to make her glow.
%epilogue_servitude_275%	She was happy to see me too... We've been able to enjoy ourselves for a long time now.
%epilogue_servitude_276%	I'll be forever in your debt for that, Fortuna.
%epilogue_servitude_277%	If only I knew...
%epilogue_servitude_278%	I know... I'm sorry. But thank you anyway.
%epilogue_servitude_282%	I got to meet with Gloria.
%epilogue_servitude_283%	It happened some years ago, but I couldn't muster the courage to tell you about it until now.
%epilogue_servitude_285%	You got to break my heart as payback. As you wrote, she didn't love me anymore.
%epilogue_servitude_286%	She gave me a dream crystal, containing all the time we spent together, in case I feel like reliving our... adventures.
%epilogue_servitude_288%	But... I'm going to miss her so much.
%epilogue_servitude_290%	I know, I don't have any right to complain. I just... wanted to tell you about how it went.
%epilogue_servitude_293%	I resented you for a long time, for having written that I'll never get to see Gloria again.
%epilogue_servitude_294%	And I couldn't have cared less about that "you will find a love greater than hers" bullshit.
%epilogue_servitude_295%	But...
%epilogue_servitude_296%	It did happen.
%epilogue_servitude_297%	I tend to forget how fearsome your powers are.
%epilogue_servitude_299%	I...
%epilogue_servitude_301%	I'm madly in love.
%epilogue_servitude_303%	And this is the weirdest part for me... I fell in love with another Behemoth.
%epilogue_servitude_304%	It's the first time in my multiple existences that I liked someone other than a Witch.
%epilogue_servitude_305%	And... shit. To connect with someone who knows how it feels to unexist, to peek behind the curtain...
%epilogue_servitude_306%	We understand each other so well...
%epilogue_servitude_308%	I'm so happy, Fortuna!
%epilogue_servitude_309%	Ok, ok, cut it out, will you?
%epilogue_servitude_311%	Yes. Sorry. Thank you.
%epilogue_servitude_317%	Anyway... Gloria just recently ascended.
%epilogue_servitude_318%	Why did you have to turn her into a goddess?
%epilogue_servitude_319%	It's not fair. She wasn't part of our game...
%epilogue_servitude_320%	What can I say? You're not the only one messing up lives anymore.
%epilogue_servitude_321%	Heh... yeah.
%epilogue_servitude_323%	Dude, this doesn't feel like gossiping at all.
%epilogue_servitude_324%	You're just using me for therapy.
%epilogue_servitude_326%	Ah... yes, yes. I can't help but think of you as a friend...
%epilogue_servitude_328%	But enough about me!
%epilogue_servitude_331%	Who would you like to gossip about?
%epilogue_servitude_334%	The coven.
%epilogue_servitude_335%	Dahlia.
%epilogue_servitude_336%	Jasmine.
%epilogue_servitude_337%	Grethe.
%epilogue_servitude_338%	My sister Patrice.
%epilogue_servitude_339%	Yu-ënia, my mentor.
%epilogue_servitude_340%	Cupressa.
%epilogue_servitude_341%	Look at the time! Don't you have somewhere else to be?
%epilogue_servitude_354%	Well, she's doing fine.
%epilogue_servitude_355%	Since the catastrophe she's retired completely from any form of politics.
%epilogue_servitude_356%	She started her own hunting guild and they take on huge cosmic beasts.
%epilogue_servitude_357%	...They even manage to take down a rogue Behemoth. Scary shit.
%epilogue_servitude_361%	She ended up marrying a Daemon, can you believe it?
%epilogue_servitude_362%	Now the Daemon acts as an informant on the dealings of their own kind. I have zero respect for that.
%epilogue_servitude_363%	Although... such a massive betrayal is a pretty daemonic thing to do.
%epilogue_servitude_367%	Well... she died a decade ago.
%epilogue_servitude_368%	Yes, I wrote that. One more thing I'm never going to be able to forgive myself for...
%epilogue_servitude_369%	Poor Dahlia, she didn't deserve that.
%epilogue_servitude_371%	Come on, you read that back when you were unaware of the true nature of your arts.
%epilogue_servitude_373%	...Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_servitude_377%	In any case, finding a successor to continue Dahlia's leadership hasn't been as gruesome as our infamous congress thing.
%epilogue_servitude_378%	Since Dahlia was aware of the proximity of her death, she trained a successor and surprisingly the coven has had no problem accepting her.
%epilogue_servitude_379%	I'm sure it has to do with the fact that most of the Witches of the coven are now women who ascended thanks to Dahlia's efforts to scatter Aedana's remains.
%epilogue_servitude_380%	I'm going to miss her.
%epilogue_servitude_381%	...Yeah, me too.
%epilogue_servitude_384%	With Dahlia's death, your old sisterhood is officially over.
%epilogue_servitude_385%	No more Witches are ascending since you cast that extinction future over cosmic society.
%epilogue_servitude_386%	Good.
%epilogue_servitude_387%	Harsh.
%epilogue_servitude_388%	Let's change the mood...
%epilogue_servitude_392%	Dahlia's glowing. It's been hard to rebuild the coven after the congress catastrophe, but...
%epilogue_servitude_393%	Dahlia's good. Not only for the coven, for the whole of cosmic society.
%epilogue_servitude_394%	Ironically enough for a warrior Witch, her system's brought unprecedented levels of peace to the whole universe.
%epilogue_servitude_395%	Even with your old sisterhood being a shadow of what I was, it's respected and copied throughout many covens.
%epilogue_servitude_396%	That's good, I guess...
%epilogue_servitude_397%	You don't sound too chipper about it.
%epilogue_servitude_398%	Yes, no... It's just one of those days.
%epilogue_servitude_399%	Ok, let's change the topic.
%epilogue_servitude_402%	Well, the coven dissolved about a decade ago and she's still blaming herself.
%epilogue_servitude_403%	I told her a hundred times that I was the one who wrote this bleak future.
%epilogue_servitude_404%	I guess that blaming oneself is less painful than accepting that your whole life has been puppeteered by a single card.
%epilogue_servitude_405%	When you put it that way... yeah.
%epilogue_servitude_406%	Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_servitude_410%	Well, you tell me.
%epilogue_servitude_411%	You still haven't introduced me to Larissa.
%epilogue_servitude_412%	You three have been all buddy-buddy with her since you met her a couple of decades ago.
%epilogue_servitude_413%	Oh, yeah! Writing that fourth Witch into our group was the best thing I've done in my whole life.
%epilogue_servitude_415%	She's the best, did you know she was a marketing director back on Earth?
%epilogue_servitude_418%	She's the best, did you know she was a marketing director on Mars?
%epilogue_servitude_420%	In the short time she's been a Witch she's discovered so many great joints throughout the galaxy to go and have a good time.
%epilogue_servitude_421%	She's still amazed by Witches' capacity to not get hungover at all, haha.
%epilogue_servitude_422%	Come on! That's not fair, I want to meet her too!
%epilogue_servitude_423%	No. She's mine. We met her after I paid the price, so she's not part of your coven.
%epilogue_servitude_424%	Bah.
%epilogue_servitude_425%	Whatever.
%epilogue_servitude_430%	Well, you tell me. Since you left the coven you three have been pretty hermetic.
%epilogue_servitude_431%	I want in on the fun too!
%epilogue_servitude_432%	No way. What we have now is just too good to let a dangerous Behemoth in.
%epilogue_servitude_433%	I mean, you're aware that you are forever my servants, right?
%epilogue_servitude_434%	Even if you break off from the sisterhood and start a new one, that spin off belongs to me anyway.
%epilogue_servitude_435%	Ábramar...
%epilogue_servitude_436%	Ok... I'll give you a break.
%epilogue_servitude_437%	What have you been up to, though?
%epilogue_servitude_438%	Well, surprise: just living!
%epilogue_servitude_439%	You don't need to be in a massive sisterhood to be happy or fulfilled. I feel like an idiot for having taken such a long time to realize that.
%epilogue_servitude_440%	Why the hell did I put up with Aedana's bullshit for so long?
%epilogue_servitude_441%	Being independent is the best. A coven of three is the way to be. A family.
%epilogue_servitude_442%	It's not fair! I want in!!
%epilogue_servitude_443%	Fuck off.
%epilogue_servitude_444%	Very well...
%epilogue_servitude_446%	Moving on.
%epilogue_servitude_449%	Anyway, about Dahlia:
%epilogue_servitude_450%	She ended up marrying that Daemon I made up with my cards back when I "read" her past, can you believe it?
%epilogue_servitude_451%	Now the Daemon acts as an informant on the dealings of their own kind. I have zero respect for that.
%epilogue_servitude_452%	Although... such a massive betrayal is a pretty daemonic thing to do.
%epilogue_servitude_453%	Wow.
%epilogue_servitude_454%	Yup. Wow.
%epilogue_servitude_472%	Jasmine hasn't been herself of late.
%epilogue_servitude_473%	After her garden withered and died she's been pretty aimless.
%epilogue_servitude_475%	I just hope she finds something that drives her soon enough, or I see her turning into a corpse sooner or later.
%epilogue_servitude_476%	Oof... That's harsh. I was hoping for her to emerge renewed from this, but...
%epilogue_servitude_477%	Yeah, it's tough shit.
%epilogue_servitude_478%	Let's lighten the mood.
%epilogue_servitude_481%	From what I know, Jasmine's doing amazing.
%epilogue_servitude_482%	As you "foretold," her garden grew beyond her wildest expectations. She's now a mentor to many producers from all corners of the cosmos.
%epilogue_servitude_483%	Her gardening dojo is practically an institution of its own nowadays.
%epilogue_servitude_485%	Good for her.
%epilogue_servitude_488%	Jasmine's barely a Witch anymore. She's... something greater. Scarier even, I'd say.
%epilogue_servitude_489%	Ever since she merged with her garden she gives me more of a Behemoth vibe than a Witch one.
%epilogue_servitude_490%	She's extremely cool, though.
%epilogue_servitude_491%	I bet she is.
%epilogue_servitude_492%	Anyway.
%epilogue_servitude_495%	Jasmine hasn't been herself of late.
%epilogue_servitude_496%	After her garden was taken from her to be exploited by that new Deerfolk Cult... she's been pretty aimless.
%epilogue_servitude_499%	As you "predicted," that cosmic plague hit not only our coven but the whole of cosmic society pretty hard. But thanks to Jasmine's efforts, everyone's alright.
%epilogue_servitude_500%	She's now revered as some kind of hero.
%epilogue_servitude_501%	So I'd say she's doing pretty good.
%epilogue_servitude_504%	Jasmine's hands are full training her sentient garden nowadays.
%epilogue_servitude_505%	She gives off this motherly aura, full of pride for what her... mmm... "creature" is achieving.
%epilogue_servitude_506%	So far about a dozen barren moons have become lush gardens and forests thanks to Jasmine's sentient garden's blessing.
%epilogue_servitude_507%	Whoa.
%epilogue_servitude_508%	Is it weird to feel proud for having written that?
%epilogue_servitude_509%	The moral quandaries of your arts will always be beyond me, really.
%epilogue_servitude_510%	Fair enough.
%epilogue_servitude_513%	Jasmine has her hands full with what remains of the Jade Sculptors.
%epilogue_servitude_514%	As you wrote, they've become addicted to Jasmine's mixtures... apparently it allows them to connect with the Jade Monks in the astral plane.
%epilogue_servitude_515%	So... Jasmine is some kind of prophet for them now.
%epilogue_servitude_516%	I wouldn't like to be in her shoes.
%epilogue_servitude_517%	I feel you.
%epilogue_servitude_518%	Anyway.
%epilogue_servitude_522%	Well, I wasn't exactly rooting for Jasmine, but her mandate has been surprisingly effective.
%epilogue_servitude_523%	And even with how hard it's been to rebuild the coven... Our sisterhood has become an institution throughout the galaxy.
%epilogue_servitude_524%	Jasmine's judgment is so revered that she's mediating in other coven's issues now. She pulls the strings of most of cosmic society from her humble throne.
%epilogue_servitude_525%	Good for her.
%epilogue_servitude_528%	You created a monster, Fortuna.
%epilogue_servitude_529%	In her effort to rebuild the sisterhood, Jasmine's been conquering other covens to increase our numbers.
%epilogue_servitude_530%	In the beginning it was just... aggressive negotiations to get smaller communities to join us.
%epilogue_servitude_531%	But the last couple of decades have been all-out war campaigns. The last to join was the Machina Cult.
%epilogue_servitude_532%	And... I don't even want to know what Jasmine's planning to do with all their firepower.
%epilogue_servitude_533%	Ah...
%epilogue_servitude_536%	Anyway, remember that thing you read about Jasmine's garden?
%epilogue_servitude_540%	Well, you tell me.
%epilogue_servitude_541%	You still haven't introduced me to Larissa.
%epilogue_servitude_542%	You've been all buddy-buddy with her since you met her a couple of decades ago.
%epilogue_servitude_543%	Oh, yeah! Writing that fourth Witch into our group was the best thing I've done in my whole life.
%epilogue_servitude_545%	She's the best, did you know she was a marketing director back on Earth?
%epilogue_servitude_548%	She's the best, did you know she was a marketing director on Mars?
%epilogue_servitude_550%	In the short time she's been a Witch she's discovered so many great joints throughout the galaxy to go and have a good time.
%epilogue_servitude_551%	She's still amazed by Witches' capacity to not get hungover at all, haha.
%epilogue_servitude_552%	Come on! That's not fair, I want to meet her too!
%epilogue_servitude_553%	No. She's mine. We met her after I paid the price so she's not part of your coven.
%epilogue_servitude_554%	Bah.
%epilogue_servitude_555%	Whatever.
%epilogue_servitude_559%	Well, you tell me. Since you left the coven you've been pretty hermetic.
%epilogue_servitude_560%	I want in on the fun too!
%epilogue_servitude_561%	No way. What we have now is just too good to let a dangerous Behemoth in.
%epilogue_servitude_562%	I mean, you're aware that you are forever my servants, right?
%epilogue_servitude_563%	Even if you break off from the sisterhood and start a new one, that spin off belongs to me just the same.
%epilogue_servitude_564%	Ábramar...
%epilogue_servitude_565%	Ok... I'll give you a break.
%epilogue_servitude_566%	What have you been up to, though?
%epilogue_servitude_567%	Well, surprise: just living!
%epilogue_servitude_568%	You don't need to be in a massive sisterhood to be happy or fulfilled. I feel like an idiot for having taken such a long time to realize that.
%epilogue_servitude_569%	Why the hell did I put up with Aedana's bullshit for so long?
%epilogue_servitude_570%	Being independent is the best. A coven of three is the way to be. A family.
%epilogue_servitude_572%	It's not fair! I want in!!
%epilogue_servitude_573%	Fuck off.
%epilogue_servitude_574%	Very well...
%epilogue_servitude_576%	Moving on.
%epilogue_servitude_579%	Well, two now, since Dahlia died...
%epilogue_servitude_580%	I'm never going to get used to her not being with us...
%epilogue_servitude_582%	Yeah... the universe misses her.
%epilogue_servitude_584%	Let's not dwell on that.
%epilogue_servitude_594%	She's lucky you wrote that Behemoths and Witches would get to coexist in harmony.
%epilogue_servitude_595%	Because after her declarations in congress... Well, it was either cosmic erasure or this.
%epilogue_servitude_596%	They kept her prisoner for a while in the Arbitrage Office, but later it was decided that Behemoths weren't a threat, per se.
%epilogue_servitude_597%	Grethe actually played a major part in convincing the Arbitrage Office that Witches could benefit greatly from collaborating with Behemoths.
%epilogue_servitude_598%	So it all worked out well in the end.
%epilogue_servitude_601%	Grethe lucked out with what you wrote about Witches relaxing their policies regarding Behemoths.
%epilogue_servitude_602%	She was judged, and after she explained all the wisdom she got to access thanks to her dealing with Gaethëryan, they let her go.
%epilogue_servitude_603%	That actually set the precedent for starting to judge Behemoths on a case by case basis.
%epilogue_servitude_604%	So she's kind of a hero in the eyes of Behemoths now, hah.
%epilogue_servitude_607%	Mmm... It's been a long time since I last saw Grethe.
%epilogue_servitude_608%	She had to flee after her bold declarations in congress about her dealing with the Behemoth...
%epilogue_servitude_609%	And she can't just edit reality to evade answering to the Arbiters as you do.
%epilogue_servitude_610%	The thing is that she wasn't doing badly when I saw her. She welcomed being pushed out of her comfort zone and becoming a fugitive philosopher, haha.
%epilogue_servitude_611%	She's completely bonkers, that one.
%epilogue_servitude_614%	Having accessed Gaethëryan's wisdom, she's been a great conversation partner lately.
%epilogue_servitude_615%	I think that soon enough I'll make her my right hand.
%epilogue_servitude_616%	It's rare to find a Witch who is able to debate certain aspects of unexistence...
%epilogue_servitude_617%	A true gift from the cosmos, that one.
%epilogue_servitude_620%	...Oh, you don't know?
%epilogue_servitude_621%	Grethe was captured by the Machina Cult.
%epilogue_servitude_622%	They learned about her dealings with the Behemoth, and decided to go after her.
%epilogue_servitude_624%	And since Grethe was fused to Gaethëryan, they've managed to override her thoughts.
%epilogue_servitude_626%	Now she's like an automaton in the hands of the Machina Cult, helping them build and design factories with her architectural expertise.
%epilogue_servitude_629%	And even if she managed to get free from Gaethëryan, in the end her mind was permanently altered... making it susceptible to the Cult's control device.
%epilogue_servitude_632%	Hey, how's Grethe?
%epilogue_servitude_633%	She's good! She's the fucking best, as always.
%epilogue_servitude_634%	She's currently on one of her... thinking escapades.
%epilogue_servitude_635%	Grethe carved a shrine with one of the fragments from the House of Cosmic Providence she found floating around in space.
%epilogue_servitude_636%	She says this is the one, she's absolutely about to unravel the meaning of life.
%epilogue_servitude_637%	But I've heard that like fifty times since we've been together.
%epilogue_servitude_638%	It's good to see her so driven, though.
%epilogue_servitude_639%	Makes me happy.
%epilogue_servitude_640%	I love her so much.
%epilogue_servitude_641%	Ohh... That's nice.
%epilogue_servitude_642%	I made this happen, huh? I can't be so bad!
%epilogue_servitude_643%	Shut up.
%epilogue_servitude_645%	Hahahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_647%	Anyway...
%epilogue_servitude_658%	Ah... I actually miss her.
%epilogue_servitude_659%	She seemed happy during her last few years though, next to that rapper.
%epilogue_servitude_660%	It's weird, I wrote she was going to fall in love with a poet.
%epilogue_servitude_661%	Come on, same thing.
%epilogue_servitude_662%	How come you didn't go to visit in her last years?
%epilogue_servitude_663%	Ah... I couldn't bear to lose her a third time, come on.
%epilogue_servitude_664%	Fair enough.
%epilogue_servitude_667%	Oh, shit, I miss Patrice so much.
%epilogue_servitude_668%	What a shame you didn't come to the last orgy.
%epilogue_servitude_669%	Why the fuck would I go to my sister's death orgy, dude.
%epilogue_servitude_670%	WAIT.
%epilogue_servitude_671%	Did you!?
%epilogue_servitude_673%	HAHAHAHA.
%epilogue_servitude_675%	I would never have missed that.
%epilogue_servitude_676%	Dude. Ew. Come on.
%epilogue_servitude_678%	Do you want me to tell you about it?
%epilogue_servitude_679%	No. Next topic, please.
%epilogue_servitude_680%	Your loss.
%epilogue_servitude_683%	Ah... I actually miss her.
%epilogue_servitude_684%	It was really beautiful, the day she ascended to become a goddess of arts and inspiration...
%epilogue_servitude_685%	I've never seen a ritual with so many fireworks!
%epilogue_servitude_687%	And I've been to the Big Bang, hahahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_689%	I felt her lately guiding my hand during my card creation... I hope she's happy as a goddess.
%epilogue_servitude_692%	Patrice... no one's going to forget that name for as long as this cosmos exists.
%epilogue_servitude_693%	We were barely recovering from the congress catastrophe when she had to go and strike that deal with the Seed of Knowledge.
%epilogue_servitude_694%	Half the Witches in this cosmos lost their minds when Patrice opened the gates of wisdom to lost universes.
%epilogue_servitude_695%	I barely made it out myself...
%epilogue_servitude_696%	I think it'll haunt me forever, what I saw...
%epilogue_servitude_697%	I... I understand why she had to be executed for it.
%epilogue_servitude_698%	The Seed of Knowledge totally took control of her.
%epilogue_servitude_699%	Nasty business, yes.
%epilogue_servitude_700%	Let's talk about something else.
%epilogue_servitude_703%	Are you still visiting your sister's last student?
%epilogue_servitude_704%	Yes... Not as often as in the beginning but...
%epilogue_servitude_705%	Touching the gemstone she turned herself into allows me to dream with her, and talk to her in my dreams.
%epilogue_servitude_706%	Her actual self, not a manifestation of my memories.
%epilogue_servitude_707%	Her soul is still alive inside that gem.
%epilogue_servitude_708%	I would never have thought she would love an apprentice so much as to become a trinket to aid her.
%epilogue_servitude_709%	Well, you wrote it.
%epilogue_servitude_710%	Still. Hard to believe.
%epilogue_servitude_711%	I guess.
%epilogue_servitude_714%	You and Patrice don't get together much nowadays, right?
%epilogue_servitude_715%	No...
%epilogue_servitude_716%	Why's that?
%epilogue_servitude_717%	She resents me for having condemned her to immortality.
%epilogue_servitude_718%	Like... infinite immortality, she'll live as long as this universe.
%epilogue_servitude_719%	Hah, come on, that's a breeze. Do you want me to meet her and cheer her up?
%epilogue_servitude_720%	...Would you?
%epilogue_servitude_721%	Of course. I know a thing or two about outliving a universe.
%epilogue_servitude_722%	Thank you.
%epilogue_servitude_723%	Of course.
%epilogue_servitude_724%	Now...
%epilogue_servitude_727%	I heard Patrice is going to duel another Witch next month.
%epilogue_servitude_728%	Yes, and she's going to die.
%epilogue_servitude_729%	Oh, shit, right, you wrote that, right?
%epilogue_servitude_730%	I'm afraid so.
%epilogue_servitude_731%	What are they fighting about?
%epilogue_servitude_732%	The most stupid shit a Witch can duel another Witch over:
%epilogue_servitude_733%	A man.
%epilogue_servitude_735%	Hahahahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_736%	A fucking man, can you believe it?
%epilogue_servitude_738%	Well, it's her choice.
%epilogue_servitude_739%	A fucking man!
%epilogue_servitude_740%	Uh... Let's switch gears.
%epilogue_servitude_745%	You don't talk to Yu-ënia anymore?
%epilogue_servitude_746%	We write to each other from time to time. But I haven't seen her since she became independent.
%epilogue_servitude_747%	She moved her studio to another dimension and is writing books on the Cosmic Wheel and its malleable properties.
%epilogue_servitude_748%	Something tells me you played a great part in inspiring her to pick up this... endeavor.
%epilogue_servitude_749%	Yeah... I know she's only doing it to not see me suffer. To see if there's a way we can better control my power and... fix things.
%epilogue_servitude_750%	I don't want her doing that. She's wasting her immortality away.
%epilogue_servitude_751%	But... we all know there's no way of stopping a driven Witch.
%epilogue_servitude_752%	Hear hear.
%epilogue_servitude_753%	Anyway.
%epilogue_servitude_764%	Well, I heard Cupressa's happy.
%epilogue_servitude_765%	She made her peace with Aedana's death and isn't obsessed with preserving her legacy anymore.
%epilogue_servitude_766%	She went to live at the Hundred Column Worship, where she spends all of her time writing biographies on really old Witches.
%epilogue_servitude_767%	You could pay her a visit.
%epilogue_servitude_768%	No thanks.
%epilogue_servitude_769%	Heh.
%epilogue_servitude_772%	Cupressa has become a really popular teacher among the novices.
%epilogue_servitude_773%	For some reason a lot of Witches from our coven and others want to hear about Aedana's work and miracles.
%epilogue_servitude_774%	I'm the reason... I wrote that.
%epilogue_servitude_775%	Well, I'd say it's not hurting anyone.
%epilogue_servitude_776%	Tsk.
%epilogue_servitude_777%	We don't need to talk about it.
%epilogue_servitude_780%	I spied on Cupressa recently.
%epilogue_servitude_781%	Her Cult of the Mask Whispers isn't doing any better than it was a century ago.
%epilogue_servitude_782%	Just a bunch of Aedana fans worshiping one of her Golden Maks and pressing their ears against it.
%epilogue_servitude_783%	I checked, and it's all hallucinations. The Mask is dead, it doesn't whisper or do anything anymore.
%epilogue_servitude_784%	But it makes them happy, I guess.
%epilogue_servitude_787%	Uh... It's not pretty with Cupressa.
%epilogue_servitude_788%	She just roams the cosmos spouting nonsense.
%epilogue_servitude_789%	From time to time some mischievous novices go to prank her, trying to confuse her with weird questions.
%epilogue_servitude_790%	She's become some kind of deranged speech generator.
%epilogue_servitude_791%	I'm tempted to put her out of her misery.
%epilogue_servitude_792%	...But I guess she's not hurting anyone. Not even herself, anymore.
%epilogue_servitude_795%	The coven has been a mess since Cupressa's victory.
%epilogue_servitude_796%	She totally forsook my sisterhood, ignoring all her duties...
%epilogue_servitude_797%	But...
%epilogue_servitude_803%	You want to talk about the coven, like in general?
%epilogue_servitude_804%	From my perspective, you did a great job with the sisterhood.
%epilogue_servitude_805%	After the blow from the catastrophe at congress the coven is a shadow of what it used to be under Aedana's control...
%epilogue_servitude_806%	But everyone looks... happier, after the work you put in.
%epilogue_servitude_807%	And I'd say that's pretty much the point of existing.
%epilogue_servitude_808%	Take it from someone who's existed many times now.
%epilogue_servitude_809%	Heh... Ok, I'll take the win. Thank you.
%epilogue_servitude_813%	It's a pity that you had to sacrifice your friendship with Jasmine and Dahlia but...
%epilogue_servitude_814%	Hey, you wrote that for yourself, so I guess you're alright with it?
%epilogue_servitude_815%	I'm not... happy about it.
%epilogue_servitude_816%	I don't fully control my cartomancy... Sometimes it's like a bigger force wants to see me suffer.
%epilogue_servitude_817%	Yeah, you've mentioned that several times. Someday we should look into it.
%epilogue_servitude_818%	Ah... I'd rather leave that force undisturbed... sounds like something we shouldn't really be messing with.
%epilogue_servitude_819%	Alright... Your call.
%epilogue_servitude_822%	What do you want me to say about the coven?
%epilogue_servitude_823%	Or is it that you want me to sing your praises?
%epilogue_servitude_824%	Oh, founder of the ultimate philosophy, copied throughout almost every coven in this universe.
%epilogue_servitude_825%	Yes. Keep it coming.
%epilogue_servitude_827%	Hahahahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_828%	You're nuts, fuck off. Hahaha.
%epilogue_servitude_829%	Alright, alright...
%epilogue_servitude_831%	Now...
%epilogue_servitude_835%	Look at the time! Don't you have somewhere else to be?
%epilogue_servitude_836%	Wow. Rude.
%epilogue_servitude_837%	Baby steps, Ábramar.
%epilogue_servitude_838%	I'm not ready to be friends... I'm not sure if I ever will be.
%epilogue_servitude_839%	So let's take it easy, alright?
%epilogue_servitude_841%	...
%epilogue_servitude_842%	I understand.
%epilogue_servitude_847%	By the way, when is that all-out cosmic war you wrote going to happen?
%epilogue_servitude_848%	It's been a century and there's no sign of an intergalactic conflict cooking.
%epilogue_servitude_849%	Who knows. It took two centuries for my prediction about the coven falling to happen.
%epilogue_servitude_850%	There's plenty of time for things to get messed up.
%epilogue_servitude_852%	...I see. you're right.
%epilogue_servitude_853%	Not that I'm looking forward to it or anything. I just wanted a little heads up.
%epilogue_servitude_856%	Please, let me know if you ever want to meet up again.
%epilogue_servitude_857%	I will.
%epilogue_servitude_858%	Goodbye, Ábramar.
%epilogue_servitude_859%	Goodbye, Fortuna.
%spread_the_end_intro_2%	...
%spread_the_end_intro_4%	I fucking hate fate.
%spread_the_end_theend_6%	There will always be things in life that escape our control. We cannot fight them all. But we can mourn, remember, learn, share, and accept.
%spread_the_end_theend_11%	This is bullshit. I will never learn to live with this. I will be miserable if I don't try again. After I go to sleep, time will restart, and I will get to fix everything.
%spread_the_end_followup_3%	Heh... As if this would work...
%spread_the_end_followup_4%	Even I'm not that powerful.
%spread_the_end_followup_6%	I'm feeling sleepy, though...
%spread_the_end_followup_11%	Pain can latch onto the walls of your body like burning ivy.
%spread_the_end_followup_13%	The only thing to do is to breathe and keep on going.
%spread_the_end_followup_14%	For today... that'll be enough.
%end_again_2%	Why are you this stubborn?
%end_again_3%	I thought I made it clear.
%end_again_4%	There's no way around it.
%end_again_5%	You will pay the price.
%end_again_6%	It doesn't matter how many times you try.
%end_again_7%	But...
%end_again_8%	The truth is that I'd welcome a million lives with you.
%end_again_9%	Again and again.
%end_again_10%	Allow me to join your torment once more.
%epilogue_nofriends_2%	...
%epilogue_nofriends_3%	I've never felt this alone in my whole life.
%epilogue_nofriends_4%	Why the fuck did I alienate everyone I love?
%epilogue_nofriends_5%	Why am I like this...
%epilogue_nofriends_6%	What did I even do in this existence?
%epilogue_nofriends_7%	...
%knowledge_study_2%	Oh, ancient eye of our former leader.
%knowledge_study_3%	Allow me to pierce through the fabric of this magic.
%knowledge_study_4%	I desire to know more.
%knowledge_first_time_grimoire_2%	Hmm...
%knowledge_first_time_grimoire_3%	I feel different. Aedana's eye is pulsing inside my skull.
%knowledge_first_time_grimoire_4%	I feel as if I could see beyond the pictorial representations of arcana.
%knowledge_first_time_grimoire_5%	Maybe I could spend a little magic to peek behind the cosmic curtain.
%bed_study_1_2%	Excerpt of "On The Four Elements" by Witch Yu-ënia.
%bed_study_1_3%	"For the initiate, the fact that Magic is reduced to four elements may strike them as an oversimplification."
%bed_study_1_4%	"But the building blocks of our universe are simple. No matter what taxonomy you develop to understand reality, it always fits within the four elements."
%bed_study_1_5%	"Even if you reject anything astral and focus on the material things, reality can be divided into four elements: Gas (Air), Liquid (Water), Solid (Earth), and Energy (Fire)."
%bed_study_1_6%	"In a more philosophical sense, you can dissect anything by analyzing its Where (Earth), When (Air), Why (Water), and How (Fire).
%bed_study_1_7%	"You can even pick apart the most mundane things by these rules. For instance, a stone:"
%bed_study_1_8%	"Its Air will reveal to you how it affects its environment, what the social preconceptions are about it, or how much time it has been standing there."
%bed_study_1_9%	"Its Water will allow you to access its potential to become poetry:"
%bed_study_1_10%	"The reason this stone and no other ended up in that particular place, or what its initial form was before erosion shaped it in that way."
%bed_study_1_11%	"Its Earth demonstrates what that stone is made of, how good it would be as a part of a wall, or even what kinds of carvings you could work onto it."
%bed_study_1_12%	"Its Fire tells us its potential to cause harm, how easy it would be to break it apart, or how coveted that stone could be."
%bed_study_1_13%	"As you see, the four elements open the gates of thought to infinite modes of analysis."
%bed_study_2_2%	Excerpt of "On The Four Elements: Air" by Witch Yu-ënia.
%bed_study_2_3%	"In all my years of mentoring, Air, the invisible element, is the one I found most students have difficulty understanding."
%bed_study_2_4%	"Its intangible nature locks it in the world of ideas. How do you define context? It is an infinite element that expands as far as your thought wishes it to take it."
%bed_study_2_5%	"For a true master of Air there is no such thing as 'out of context.'"
%bed_study_2_6%	"Everything is intertwined and in constant relation. A river in the middle of the jungle can put in context the nature of an office worker."
%bed_study_2_7%	"A philosopher's talent could be measured in their ability to develop context to engulf all things."
%bed_study_2_8%	"Ironically, the overabundance of Air energy sabotages rational thinking and breeds chaos, because chaos is the ultimate nature of Air: everything affecting everything."
%bed_study_2_9%	"Throw a paper boat into a bucket of water and you can predict its behavior. Throw a thousand into the middle of a wild ocean and the mind begins to falter when trying to picture the outcome."
%bed_study_2_10%	"If you combine multiple energies of Air you will obtain unpredictability, luck and fortune."
%bed_study_2_11%	"Unfathomable predestination."
%bed_study_3_2%	Excerpt of "On The Four Elements: Water" by Witch Yu-ënia.
%bed_study_3_3%	"A Witch can easily fall in love with the element of Water."
%bed_study_3_4%	"Water is the substance of all things, their nature in a vacuum, its platonic ideal."
%bed_study_3_5%	"Love, desire, sadness, even hope. Anything is able to hold or channel feelings."
%bed_study_3_6%	"One could say a piece of wood isn't able to have its own genuine feelings, that emotion is in the heart of the beholder..."
%bed_study_3_7%	"But multiple experiments throughout history have proven this hypothesis wrong."
%bed_study_3_8%	"Take this very same piece of wood and leave it in a home full of love. Let a family take care of it, talk to it, embrace it."
%bed_study_3_9%	"Then take this piece of wood to another planet and leave it in the middle of a forest. Observe animals walking around it with the utmost respect."
%bed_study_3_10%	"Eventually, we would be able to witness a wandering artist falling in love with that piece of wood and taking it with them to carve the most beautiful piece of art."
%bed_study_3_11%	"Water has infinite potential. Any element can absorb a massive amount of Water energy."
%bed_study_3_12%	"When full, Water will start overflowing, impregnating any other elements in its surroundings."
%bed_study_3_13%	"Combine Water with Water and you will unlock boundless potential. You will access the maximum power that anything has to offer."
%bed_study_3_14%	"Water and Water is the realization of potential."
%bed_study_4_2%	Excerpt of "On The Four Elements: Earth" by Witch Yu-ënia.
%bed_study_4_3%	"Earth is often the most coveted element, since it symbolizes strength. And strength is always tempting."
%bed_study_4_4%	"And I define it as tempting because there actually is such a thing as too much strength."
%bed_study_4_5%	"I've witnessed many promising students fall into this honey pot. But, what is the ultimate representation of Earth?"
%bed_study_4_6%	"A rock. And the most outstanding characteristic of a rock is its immobility."
%bed_study_4_7%	"True masters of Earth don't hoard strength. It's all about balance."
%bed_study_4_8%	"Because strength can not only be drawn from you but from your peers, your tools and your opportunities."
%bed_study_4_9%	"Picture pieces of different kinds of wood. The lightest one may be at the mercy of elements, but the sturdiest one is more likely to fracture."
%bed_study_4_10%	"An Earth Witch should aspire to become wicker wood, which bends before breaking."
%bed_study_4_11%	"Combine Earth with Earth and you will provoke the paradox of the omnipotent: stagnation."
%bed_study_4_12%	"The most powerful stalemate. The inability to exercise your own might."
%bed_study_5_2%	Excerpt of "On The Four Elements: Fire" by Witch Yu-ënia.
%bed_study_5_3%	"Out of fear, Fire is the most respected element."
%bed_study_5_4%	"Since it has always represented conflict, Fire is an element that most initiates tend to avoid. Who would desire conflict?"
%bed_study_5_5%	"However, ignoring conflict will leave you at its mercy. A Witch shouldn't live with her eyes closed."
%bed_study_5_6%	"As with any other element, Fire is within everything."
%bed_study_5_7%	"There is Fire inside a cup of tea, for its potential to be poisoned, to burn your tongue, or because it reminds you of a deceased lover."
%bed_study_5_8%	"There is fire within any friendship. Even if they are kept at bay, concepts such as rivalry, envy, or anxiety are always present among sentient beings."
%bed_study_5_9%	"It is when you ignore them that you can become possessed by them."
%bed_study_5_10%	"A master of Fire is able to walk among the flames, because they know them and know how to avoid getting burnt."
%bed_study_5_11%	"Moreover, a master of Fire is a force to reckon with should they decide to unleash those flames."
%bed_study_5_12%	"Something curious happens, though, if a Witch decides to combine Fire with Fire: Rebirth."
%bed_study_5_13%	"The nature of entropy pushes everything towards its ends."
%bed_study_5_14%	"However, the end is the beginning of a new end, which is the beginning of yet another end. Ad Infinitum, Ad Nauseam."
%bed_study_5_15%	"Fire and Fire open the gates to everything new."
%bed_study_6_2%	Excerpt of "Whispers of Arcana" by Witch Aedana.
%bed_study_6_3%	"Most magical studies base themselves on the ruleset defined by the Four Elements, and even if I do not to position myself as a detractor of such forces(...)"
%bed_study_6_4%	"I believe our understanding runs the risk of becoming obsolete should we adhere to them exclusively."
%bed_study_6_5%	"It is for this reason I hereby present you a thesis on Arcana."
%bed_study_6_6%	"Even if some points overlap with the theory of the Four Elements, I believe the Arcana to be an independent and primordial quality of our reality."
%bed_study_6_7%	"Arcana may seem overwhelming at first glance because they are diffuse and multiple in meaning. It is rare to find an Arcana that adheres to a single quality."
%bed_study_6_8%	"After many centuries of analysis I have come to detect and dissect five unique properties that we can use to describe the entelechy of Arcana:"
%bed_study_6_9%	"Quest, Community, Desire, Protection, and Battle."
%bed_study_6_10%	"Some may argue that these qualities are too similar to the ones represented by the Four Elements..."
%bed_study_6_11%	"But it is because of their relation to the Four Elements that I can prove Arcana are something of their own."
%bed_study_6_12%	"It is well known that the combinations of the Four Elements are interesting but at some points limited or even dangerous."
%bed_study_6_13%	"In this thesis you will find a detailed dissection of the qualities of Arcana and how the Four Elements alter them, adding a new depth to the nature of Magic itself."
%bed_study_7_2%	Excerpt of "Whispers of Arcana: Quest" by Witch Aedana.
%bed_study_7_3%	"I find Quest to be the most special of the qualities of the Arcana because it is the only one that can't be directly linked to any of the Four Elements."
%bed_study_7_4%	"Quest is none of the elements, but the intersections between them. Quest is transitory in nature."
%bed_study_7_5%	"The search for knowledge, the call for adventure, the never ending journey."
%bed_study_7_6%	"When infused with energy, this quality of the Arcana varies wildly. Hereby, I present a detailed list of the potential states of Quest:"
%bed_study_7_7%	"Quest and Air: Guidance, Illumination, Discovery."
%bed_study_7_8%	"Quest and Water: Introspection, Isolation, Wisdom."
%bed_study_7_9%	"Quest and Earth: Determination, Trust, Rightfulness."
%bed_study_7_10%	"Quest and Fire: Deception, The Occult, The Unknown."
%bed_study_7_11%	"The elements determine the nature and direction of a journey, which can flow inwards or outwards, and can be forthright or deceptive depending on context."
%bed_study_8_2%	Excerpt of "Whispers of Arcana: Community" by Witch Aedana.
%bed_study_8_3%	"Community can be correlated with Air, and it is more intense when combined with it, but it offers a richer variety of meanings depending on the function of the Energy linked to it."
%bed_study_8_4%	"Community isn't context, per se, but the identity and volition of a group of individuals."
%bed_study_8_5%	"Culture, principles, expectations and prejudices."
%bed_study_8_6%	"When infused with energy, this quality of the Arcana varies substantially. Hereby, I present a detailed list of the potential states of Community:"
%bed_study_8_7%	"Community and Air: Justice, Karma, Retribution."
%bed_study_8_8%	"Community and Water: Communication, Peace, Temperance."
%bed_study_8_9%	"Community and Earth: Support, Success, Endorsement."
%bed_study_8_10%	"Community and Fire: Judgment, Decision, Crisis."
%bed_study_8_11%	"The elements determine the behavior of a group. They can be benevolent or harsh. A community can provide if one's accepted or it can deprive if one's rejected."
%bed_study_9_2%	Excerpt of "Whispers of Arcana: Desire" by Witch Aedana.
%bed_study_9_3%	"One would link Desire to Water for obvious reasons, but in my studies I have discovered that this quality of Arcana is so volatile its meanings explode in almost diametrically opposed directions."
%bed_study_9_4%	"Desire can manifest in the pain of not having or in the anticipation of sweetness."
%bed_study_9_5%	"The primordial directive that puts every sentient being in motion, the origin of civilizations, the spark of war."
%bed_study_9_6%	"When infused with energy, this quality of the Arcana varies dramatically. Hereby, I present a detailed list of the potential states of Desire:"
%bed_study_9_7%	"Desire and Air: Temptation, Corruption, Knowledge."
%bed_study_9_8%	"Desire and Water: Yearning, Passion, Friendship."
%bed_study_9_9%	"Desire and Earth: Motivation, Happiness, Fulfillment."
%bed_study_9_10%	"Desire and Fire: Rejection, Hatred, a Bad Omen."
%bed_study_9_11%	"The elements determine the inner nature of Desire. As I mentioned, this is a volatile quality and can be easily spun from love into hate, from a blessing into a curse."
%bed_study_10_2%	Excerpt of "Whispers of Arcana: Protection" by Witch Aedana.
%bed_study_10_3%	"Protection shines at its prime when merged with Earth energies, but its combinations with the rest of the Elements are nonetheless very interesting, too."
%bed_study_10_4%	"Protection could be defined as the resistance to change. The safekeeping of the sacred."
%bed_study_10_5%	"Our futile war against entropy, the adorable urge to postpone the inevitable."
%bed_study_10_6%	"When infused with energy, this quality of the Arcana varies in essence. Hereby, I present a detailed list of the potential states of Protection:"
%bed_study_10_7%	"Protection and Air: Authority, Everything and Everyone."
%bed_study_10_8%	"Protection and Water: Mercy, Self Care, Wellness."
%bed_study_10_9%	"Protection and Earth: Guardianship, Ego, Power."
%bed_study_10_10%	"Protection and Fire: Sabotage, Challenge, Adversity."
%bed_study_10_11%	"The elements alter the effectiveness and essence of Protection. It can become tender loving care but it can also become the perdition of ending up with an ill-willed mentor."
%bed_study_11_2%	Excerpt of "Whispers of Arcana: Battle" by Witch Aedana.
%bed_study_11_3%	"Battle is most dangerous when combined with Fire."
%bed_study_11_4%	"But, as with the other Arcana, it can be directed towards multiple natures, many of them good-hearted, as opposed to what one would expect from Battle."
%bed_study_11_5%	"After a Battle there is always an aftermath, so Battle could be summarized as the turmoil that precedes a new state of the universe."
%bed_study_11_6%	"The clash of wills, the potential of every piece on the board, the beauty in violence."
%bed_study_11_7%	"When infused with energy, this quality of the Arcana varies intensely. Hereby, I present a detailed list of the potential states of Battle:"
%bed_study_11_8%	"Battle and Air: Leadership, Purpose, Command."
%bed_study_11_9%	"Battle and Water: Courage, Resilience, Vigor."
%bed_study_11_10%	"Battle and Earth: Alliance, Approval, Reinforcement."
%bed_study_11_11%	"Battle and Fire: Rivalry, War, Tragedy."
%bed_study_11_12%	"Different elements focus on different elements of Battle. Battle can surely entice war and conflict, but also locate support or reinforce leadership."
%bed_grethe_main_1_2%	...
%bed_grethe_main_1_3%	What are you thinking?
%bed_grethe_main_1_4%	That Junreisha is quite a character.
%bed_grethe_main_1_5%	You bet. I've met with her several times in my search for meaning.
%bed_grethe_main_1_6%	I was pretty interested in her formulas and my quest piqued her interest.
%bed_grethe_main_1_7%	Oh, I didn't know you had a working relationship.
%bed_grethe_main_1_8%	Ah... not really, after a couple of conversations it turned out our interests didn't align that well.
%bed_grethe_main_1_9%	I'm mostly interested in the why, and she's focused on the how.
%bed_grethe_main_1_10%	Her formulas allowed me to better exploit my thought temples, but Junreisha didn't have time for my questions.
%bed_grethe_main_1_11%	She lowkey called my mission childish.
%bed_grethe_main_1_12%	Junreisha's quite full of herself, yeah.
%bed_grethe_main_1_13%	With all that "You don't know what I've been through."
%bed_grethe_main_1_14%	Haha, yeah.
%bed_grethe_main_1_15%	I heard she spent a decade trapped in the dungeons of the Inquisition of Cvstodia.
%bed_grethe_main_1_16%	She ascended thanks to her formulas, filled her cell's walls with inscriptions and managed to force her own ascension.
%bed_grethe_main_1_17%	Junreisha is the only Witch known to have ascended by her own design. That's something to respect.
%bed_grethe_main_1_18%	Yeah, shame her humanity didn't make it out of the cell.
%bed_grethe_main_1_19%	Heh...
%bed_grethe_main_2_2%	Grethe, how do you know Dahlia?
%bed_grethe_main_2_3%	Mmm... She's one of the first Witches I met after I ascended.
%bed_grethe_main_2_4%	I met her the same way, she's pretty fond of newcomers, haha.
%bed_grethe_main_2_5%	But in our case we ascended in the same decade, so we learned the ropes together.
%bed_grethe_main_2_6%	That's so cool!
%bed_grethe_main_2_7%	When I met her she was already a veteran, so she guided me until I managed to get rid of my kiddie wheels.
%bed_grethe_main_2_8%	And after that... I guess we enjoy each other's company.
%bed_grethe_main_2_9%	That's a bit of a surprise. Dahlia can get bored pretty quickly with philosophy.
%bed_grethe_main_2_10%	I believe that's precisely why I love having her as a friend.
%bed_grethe_main_2_11%	She has this special ability to burst your bubble.
%bed_grethe_main_2_12%	Haha, she's a force of nature, indeed.
%bed_grethe_main_2_13%	If I'm not careful I can spend years lost in thought, so it's useful to have a friend who's able to drag me back to this plane.
%bed_grethe_main_2_14%	Well, now I know a way to burst your bubble too, and it is something quite enjoyable...
%bed_grethe_main_2_15%	Heheh... You bet.
%bed_grethe_main_2_16%	I shouldn't have underestimated the power of an orgasm to clear one's thoughts.
%bed_grethe_main_2_17%	Speaking of which, I could do with a bit of extra clarity right now...
%bed_grethe_main_2_18%	Hahaha... sure.
%bed_grethe_main_2_19%	Come here.
%bed_grethe_main_3_2%	Tell me a bit about Jasmine.
%bed_grethe_main_3_6%	Ah... I am so, so sorry she ratted you out.
%bed_grethe_main_3_7%	I'm sure she didn't mean any harm, but she can be a sucker for rules...
%bed_grethe_main_3_8%	I doubt I'll ever manage to see her as a friend, but I respect her... decision.
%bed_grethe_main_3_10%	Why are you interested in her?
%bed_grethe_main_3_11%	I want to know more about you, so I'm interested in your friends.
%bed_grethe_main_3_12%	Oh, ah... In that case, what to say about Jasmine...
%bed_grethe_main_3_13%	She's a gardener Witch, a really good one, definitely the best in our coven.
%bed_grethe_main_3_14%	Jasmine is extremely powerful, but she dislikes any display of power and will never position herself over any other Witch.
%bed_grethe_main_3_15%	She ascended just before the Industrial Revolution on Earth, so technology is a bit alien to her.
%bed_grethe_main_3_16%	It's a bit funny to see her react to anything digital as if it were another form of Witchcraft, haha.
%bed_grethe_main_3_17%	You're the one to speak, you didn't even know about smartphones or videogames.
%bed_grethe_main_3_18%	Hey! But I understand them, and I took the time to try them out. I'm a huge fan of interactive fiction.
%bed_grethe_main_3_19%	You should check out a website called itch.io, they have a lot of cool short narrative experiences.
%bed_grethe_main_3_20%	Oh! Maybe we should get a computer for this asteroid, then.
%bed_grethe_main_3_21%	Haha, sure. I'll get one for you sometime.
%bed_grethe_main_3_22%	So, about Jasmine...
%bed_grethe_main_3_23%	She's really sweet and good hearted, I promise.
%bed_grethe_main_3_24%	I believe you, but her penchant for authority puts me off.
%bed_grethe_main_3_25%	You don't need to force our friendship, hehe...
%bed_grethe_main_3_26%	Ok, ok, I understand.
%bed_grethe_main_4_2%	I can't believe Aedana is dead...
%bed_grethe_main_4_3%	Are you happy she's gone?
%bed_grethe_main_4_4%	Very much so.
%bed_grethe_main_4_5%	I have a lot to gain from her demise, but in general I believe it was due time she stopped running our coven.
%bed_grethe_main_4_6%	That Witch is older than some nations, it's about time she stepped aside.
%bed_grethe_main_4_7%	I'm sure she died because she was fed up of herself.
%bed_grethe_main_4_8%	Hahaha, so mean. I love it.
%bed_grethe_main_4_9%	Did you like her?
%bed_grethe_main_4_10%	I hadn't even met her, Fortuna.
%bed_grethe_main_4_11%	Just communicated with her by proxy.
%bed_grethe_main_4_12%	She was satisfied with my quest for meaning and was even pretty forgiving with my quarterly controls.
%bed_grethe_main_4_13%	So I never paid a lot of attention to what was going on in the coven.
%bed_grethe_main_4_14%	I hate her retroactively, though.
%bed_grethe_main_4_15%	To put my darling through exile and all... I'd kill her again if she revived.
%bed_grethe_main_4_16%	Hahaha, my hero.
%bed_grethe_main_4_17%	I love you.
%bed_grethe_main_4_18%	I love you too.
%bed_grethe_main_5_3%	It's so cool what you did for $N.
%bed_grethe_main_5_4%	It was nothing. It's always cool to help new Witches to find themselves.
%bed_grethe_main_5_5%	I can't wait to see what she makes of her powers.
%bed_grethe_main_5_6%	I just hope the old Witches don't grind her down too much.
%bed_grethe_main_5_7%	It's like they forget what it's like to be freshly ascended.
%bed_grethe_main_5_8%	I guess many old Witches see newcomers as a nuisance.
%bed_grethe_main_5_9%	I sometimes get them, a Witch can be so lost in their own objectives that anything extra becomes baggage.
%bed_grethe_main_5_10%	In any case, losing one's mortality shouldn't make you forfeit your humanity, too.
%bed_grethe_main_5_11%	Plus there's lots to be learned from new Witches, too.
%bed_grethe_main_5_12%	Will you vote for scattering Aedana, then?
%bed_grethe_main_5_15%	Mmm... I haven't decided yet.
%bed_grethe_main_5_16%	I'd like to, yeah.
%bed_grethe_main_5_17%	Becoming more powerful sounds more attractive.
%bed_grethe_main_5_21%	Mmm... Haven't decided yet.
%bed_grethe_main_5_22%	Lending a hand to newcomers is fine, but maybe I'm comfortable with the current rate of ascensions.
%bed_grethe_main_5_23%	On the one hand, becoming more powerful should come in pretty handy, and taking care of so many newcomers at once could prove troublesome.
%bed_grethe_main_5_24%	On the other hand, we have all the time in the universe and we could grant happiness to so many women...
%bed_grethe_main_5_25%	I see...
%bed_grethe_main_5_29%	I'd like to, yeah.
%bed_grethe_main_5_30%	I'm not really sure what I'd do with more power, and it's always fun and heartwarming to welcome more sisters.
%bed_grethe_main_5_31%	Yeah, I feel you.
%bed_grethe_main_5_35%	Becoming more powerful sounds more attractive.
%bed_grethe_main_5_36%	I hear you.
%bed_grethe_main_5_37%	It's like my more humanitarian side is happy to open the doors of the coven.
%bed_grethe_main_5_38%	But on the other hand, it's not like Witches would stop ascending, they'll just keep doing it at the current rate.
%bed_grethe_main_5_39%	Plus I know what I'd do with more power.
%bed_grethe_main_5_40%	It's really tempting to accelerate my investigation.
%bed_grethe_main_5_41%	Mmm... that's true...
%bed_grethe_main_5_42%	I'll sleep on it.
%bed_grethe_main_6_2%	Fortuna... would you tell me a bit more about Ábramar?
%bed_grethe_main_6_3%	Sure, but he's always around, feel free to speak to him directly!
%bed_grethe_main_6_4%	Ah... I think I've had enough Behemoth adventures for a while.
%bed_grethe_main_6_5%	He makes me uneasy.
%bed_grethe_main_6_6%	Ah... poor thing. I'm sorry.
%bed_grethe_main_6_7%	I'd tell you you don't have to worry about Ábramar, but the truth is that I can't shake off the feeling he's got a hidden agenda.
%bed_grethe_main_6_8%	Why do you keep him around, then? Your business is over, you both got what you wanted. Set him free.
%bed_grethe_main_6_9%	Ah... I couldn't do that to Ábramar. I owe him too much, and he's alone in this universe.
%bed_grethe_main_6_10%	He doesn't like to acknowledge it, but he feels pretty lonely.
%bed_grethe_main_6_11%	He's become my familiar.
%bed_grethe_main_6_12%	What? You have a Behemoth as a familiar!? That's bold and... pretty badass.
%bed_grethe_main_6_13%	Didn't you tell me you were partners?
%bed_grethe_main_6_14%	We are, but that is the nature of our link. When we sealed our contract he became my familiar.
%bed_grethe_main_6_15%	He's at your service, then.
%bed_grethe_main_6_16%	Not quite. He fills the role of a familiar, but he's not as docile as your cute bird.
%bed_grethe_main_6_17%	Hmm...
%bed_grethe_main_6_18%	Well, I'll have to learn how to love him.
%bed_grethe_main_6_19%	Don't drop your guard, though.
%bed_grethe_main_6_20%	He can be quite mischievous.
%bed_grethe_main_6_21%	Ok, ok.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_2%	I love you, little tuna.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_3%	What did you say!?
%bed_grethe_casual_1_4%	Ah.. haha, you don't like it?
%bed_grethe_casual_1_5%	I don't like pet names. Not using my name, at least.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_6%	And especially not tuna. You struck a nerve there.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_7%	Hahaha, sorry, sorry. I thought it was cute and fun.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_8%	But, are we gonna use our proper names for all eternity?
%bed_grethe_casual_1_9%	What's wrong with that? They're cool names.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_10%	Yeah, they are, but I don't know, I don't want to call you the same thing as everybody else.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_11%	You can call me love, or darling, or whatever you like without twisting my name.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_12%	But that's pretty unoriginal!
%bed_grethe_casual_1_13%	Look, you can call me Gretchingson.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_14%	What!? That's ridiculous and it's longer than your real name!
%bed_grethe_casual_1_15%	But it's fun!
%bed_grethe_casual_1_16%	I won't do that.
%bed_grethe_casual_1_17%	Ah... ok, ok... no pet names. Not even Fortunesaur?
%bed_grethe_casual_1_18%	Good grief...
%bed_grethe_casual_1_19%	Hahaha...
%bed_grethe_casual_2_2%	What's your favorite color?
%bed_grethe_casual_2_3%	Purple. Yours?
%bed_grethe_casual_2_4%	Grey.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_5%	Mmm...
%bed_grethe_casual_2_6%	What are you thinking?
%bed_grethe_casual_2_7%	We Witches seem to be pretty basic when it comes to that stuff.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_8%	Mortals combine outfits all the time and when we ascend is like, "this what I like, fuck it."
%bed_grethe_casual_2_9%	Or maybe we're busy with more elevated things and don't have the time to put into picking outfits more than once in our Witch lives.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_10%	We don't even have to do laundry, so...
%bed_grethe_casual_2_11%	Ah, laundry. What a pain in the ass it was to keep my "successful architect" wardrobe clean.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_12%	Do you keep any photos from your mortal life? I'm curious.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_13%	Sure, my Instagram account should be active somewhere on Earth's servers.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_14%	I'll let you check it out some time.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_15%	Uhhh... Nice.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_16%	Do you keep any photos from the sixties?
%bed_grethe_casual_2_17%	No.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_18%	Really?
%bed_grethe_casual_2_19%	Really.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_20%	What a pity...
%bed_grethe_casual_2_21%	I'll dress up for you sometime if you feel like it.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_22%	Ooooh... I'd very much like that, haha.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_23%	We could roleplay the aggressive executive seducing the airhead hippie.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_24%	I wasn't an airhead.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_25%	You know what I mean.
%bed_grethe_casual_2_26%	Ok, ok... I'm in, hehe...
%bed_grethe_casual_3_2%	Did you have any children as a mortal?
%bed_grethe_casual_3_3%	Nope. You?
%bed_grethe_casual_3_4%	Me neither.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_5%	Aren't you curious what it would have been like to become a mother?
%bed_grethe_casual_3_6%	Not at all. I don't mind children but the whole giving birth thing isn't for me.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_7%	And I bet I'd suck at parenting.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_8%	I've often wondered if I'm missing something by not jumping through all the hoops of human reproduction.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_9%	Hahaha, "human reproduction," what a way to put it.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_10%	See? I'm completely out of touch.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_11%	It nags at me that I may be lacking a piece for my thought quest from having missed that perspective.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_12%	You still have time to become a mother. Witches are able to get pregnant, from either mortals or supernatural beings.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_13%	I'm not a fan of the idea of giving birth just for the sake of an investigation...
%bed_grethe_casual_3_14%	Ah... you're right, that wouldn't be fair for the creature.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_15%	I could always conduct some interviews with mothers around the universe.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_16%	Sounds cool.
%bed_grethe_casual_3_17%	I may do that, yeah.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_2%	Do you enjoy divination?
%bed_grethe_casual_4_3%	Of course, it's my favorite thing in this universe.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_4%	Why?
%bed_grethe_casual_4_5%	Huh... I never stopped to think about it.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_6%	Would you indulge me? I'm pretty interested in why we all do what we do.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_7%	I believe it's a mix of being an anxious person by nature and not being fond of social mingling.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_8%	Divination keeps me distracted from the present and dispels the uneasiness of being unsure of what's ahead.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_9%	And the social part?
%bed_grethe_casual_4_10%	I've never been good at dealing with other people.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_11%	Back when I was a mortal, Tarot would make a great icebreaker, and it was the only way I could maintain a long and sincere conversation with anyone.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_12%	Nowadays it allows me to meet new Witches and develop relationships quickly without beating around the awkward bush of getting acquainted with someone.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_13%	I wouldn't have met you if it wasn't for my divination skills.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_14%	True, true. Meeting you was pretty intense, and that reading you did for me was like opening a highway to my heart.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_15%	I don't think my existence would make any sense without divination, to be honest.
%bed_grethe_casual_4_16%	Interesting...
%bed_grethe_casual_5_2%	Do you like movies?
%bed_grethe_casual_5_3%	Mmm... Yes, but since I ascended I haven't cared much about cinema.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_4%	My sister was pretty into it, so I went with her to the theater every other weekend back when we were mortals.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_5%	That's cool. What is your favorite movie?
%bed_grethe_casual_5_6%	Mmm... funnily enough it's the last one I watched on Earth - "2001: A Space Odyssey."
%bed_grethe_casual_5_7%	Really? I found it pretty dull. Maybe it impacted you because of the times you lived in.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_8%	No. 2001 is an absolute work of art even centuries after its release.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_9%	Whoa, whoa, ok. I didn't know you liked it that much.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_10%	What's your favorite film?
%bed_grethe_casual_5_11%	Mmm... it's a bit embarrassing. Marvel's Dr. Strange.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_12%	What? They made a movie of it?
%bed_grethe_casual_5_13%	Ah, yeah, there were movies about pretty much every comic book character by the time I ascended.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_14%	And why would you be embarrassed about liking it?
%bed_grethe_casual_5_15%	Ah... in my time it wasn't considered "high art." So my colleagues always made fun of me for it.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_16%	But that movie... its creativity just blows my mind... and the visuals! Still more stunning than some stuff I've witnessed here in outer space.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_17%	Wow. Would you like to watch it with me sometime?
%bed_grethe_casual_5_18%	Of course!
%bed_grethe_casual_5_19%	But only if I don't have to watch 2001 again in exchange.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_20%	Haha... how rude.
%bed_grethe_casual_5_21%	Hahaha.
%bed_grethe_idle_1_2%	I love you.
%bed_grethe_idle_1_3%	Mmm...
%bed_grethe_idle_1_4%	I love you.
%bed_grethe_idle_1_5%	Eh? What was that?
%bed_grethe_idle_1_6%	I said I love you.
%bed_grethe_idle_1_7%	Oh, I love you too. Sorry, I was lost in thought.
%bed_grethe_idle_1_8%	It's ok, keep at it.
%bed_grethe_idle_2_2%	Mmm... However...
%bed_grethe_idle_2_3%	No... that defeats the whole purpose.
%bed_grethe_idle_2_4%	You're so cute when you're in introspection mode.
%bed_grethe_idle_2_5%	But it could fit in the soul-mind theorem...
%bed_grethe_idle_2_6%	I love you.
%bed_grethe_idle_2_7%	...No, it's impossible.
%bed_grethe_idle_2_8%	Haha...
%bed_grethe_idle_2_9%	Back to square one...
%bed_grethe_idle_3_2%	I love you so much.
%bed_grethe_idle_3_3%	Me too.
%bed_grethe_idle_4_2%	That would be a great design...
%bed_grethe_idle_4_3%	Maybe multiplying the convex resonance...
%bed_grethe_idle_4_4%	You said something?
%bed_grethe_idle_4_5%	Ah, sorry, just thinking about how to improve the Gem Skull Belt.
%bed_grethe_idle_4_6%	Cool.
%bed_menu_3%	What to do...
%bed_menu_6%	Study.
%bed_menu_7%	Read Patrice's demographics analysis.
%bed_menu_8%	Read interactive fiction.
%bed_menu_9%	Cuddle with Grethe.
%bed_menu_10%	Sleep.
%bed_menu_11%	%gen_back_btn%
%bed_menu_15%	Alright, what do we have here...
%bed_menu_19%	I've studied enough, best not overdo it...
%bed_menu_24%	I'll pick an interactive tale at random from my collection...
%bed_menu_28%	I don't want to devour my precious collection in one sitting. I'll let it rest for a bit.
%bed_menu_32%	Hey, Grethe...
%bed_menu_37%	Mmm... I'll just rest for a bit...
%bed_menu_42%	Let's see what Patrice prepared for me...
%bed_study_hub_2%	I already went through all the study material I have...
%bed_study_hub_3%	What should I review?
%bed_study_hub_6%	"On The Four Elements"
%bed_study_hub_7%	"Whispers of Arcana"
%bed_study_hub_8%	Never mind.
%bed_study_hub_15%	Mmm... Which chapter?
%bed_study_hub_18%	Introduction.
%bed_study_hub_19%	Air.
%bed_study_hub_20%	Water.
%bed_study_hub_21%	Earth.
%bed_study_hub_22%	Fire.
%bed_study_hub_37%	Mmm... which chapter.
%bed_study_hub_40%	Introduction.
%bed_study_hub_41%	Quest.
%bed_study_hub_42%	Community.
%bed_study_hub_43%	Desire.
%bed_study_hub_44%	Protection.
%bed_study_hub_45%	Battle.
%if_tales_1_2%	"The Secret Cut" by Jordi de Paco.
%if_tales_1_3%	There's always been a legend among Butchers on the island of Terranova about a secret cut hidden inside cows with crimson fur.
%if_tales_1_4%	Cows with crimson fur are already a rarity, but finding this piece of meat is even rarer, and requires a high level of skill to extract it undamaged.
%if_tales_1_5%	As the myth goes, whoever eats this delicacy will be blessed with unwavering health and good fortune.
%if_tales_1_6%	Not once in your seventy years as a Butcher have you ever come across a crimson cow... until today.
%if_tales_1_7%	A farmer friend of yours brought it before dawn. A very young calf, just a few weeks old.
%if_tales_1_8%	He doesn't want to have anything to do with crimson cows since he believes they bring "bad fortune."
%if_tales_1_9%	You’re not sure if he's unaware of the legend or if he's really had bad experiences with them.
%if_tales_1_10%	In any case, there she is, her fur bright as a bonfire, even in the dim light of your workshop.
%if_tales_1_13%	She's too precious. Spare her life.
%if_tales_1_14%	Butcher the cow.
%if_tales_1_18%	You sharpen your knife and look her in the eye.
%if_tales_1_19%	What you're about to do feels like heresy.
%if_tales_1_21%	For the life of you, this animal is too unique to be turned into meat.
%if_tales_1_22%	You spare her life and adopt her as your life companion. You name her "Rhapsody."
%if_tales_1_23%	She brings you health and happiness by means of company, not sustenance.
%if_tales_1_24%	She is gentle, loving and patient. She listens to all your tales and reacts with a moo in just the right places.
%if_tales_1_25%	Four years go by. Rhapsody grows big and soft. You prepared a bucket of her favorite herbs to celebrate her fourth birthday.
%if_tales_1_26%	As you are singing "Happy Birthday" to her, an expensive black car drives slowly into your yard.
%if_tales_1_27%	The chauffeur gets out and opens the door to an old woman emblazoned with a fancy red coat.
%if_tales_1_28%	She joins the singing with a smile. "Good day to you, dear Butcher," she says upon finishing the song. Rhapsody dives into her birthday treat.
%if_tales_1_29%	"I'm happy to find this fine specimen in good health. I'd like to purchase your cow."
%if_tales_1_30%	The chauffeur opens a briefcase in front of you.
%if_tales_1_31%	"One million dollars if you get the secret cut out of her for me."
%if_tales_1_34%	Refuse.
%if_tales_1_35%	Accept.
%if_tales_1_39%	You refuse, Rhapsody is just too precious.
%if_tales_1_40%	The woman twists her nose.
%if_tales_1_41%	"I'm willing to go up to five million dollars if you get the legendary meat for me, please."
%if_tales_1_44%	Refuse again.
%if_tales_1_45%	Accept.
%if_tales_1_49%	No.
%if_tales_1_50%	Rhapsody is not for sale.
%if_tales_1_51%	The woman senses your unbreakable determination and decides to give up.
%if_tales_1_52%	They pack up graciously and leave forever.
%if_tales_1_53%	You live until you are a hundred years old, not finding yourself bedridden a single time.
%if_tales_1_54%	You and Rhapsody die together, peacefully, cuddled in her stable.
%if_tales_1_55%	You tell her goodbye, and she moos just at the right time.
%if_tales_1_60%	That is a lot of money, and you are a Butcher, after all.
%if_tales_1_61%	You let Rhapsody enjoy her last meal and guide her into your workshop.
%if_tales_1_62%	You kill her with a nail gun against her forehead and she falls with a sonorous thud. As if a goddess was robbed of her might.
%if_tales_1_63%	You cut her open.
%if_tales_1_64%	You put her aside piece by piece, with ceremonial care. Finally, you get to the coveted meat, uncannily close to her heart.
%if_tales_1_65%	Your knife plunges into the soft meat, but you don't manage to rid your blade of emotion. Your pulse ruins the cut.
%if_tales_1_66%	"I'm sorry," you cry while your tears clean the blood off the knife.
%if_tales_1_67%	"Well, that's too bad." The woman answers as if you were apologizing to her.
%if_tales_1_68%	She pays you ten thousand dollars for the fur and the inconvenience, and leaves forever.
%if_tales_1_69%	As the Butcher that you are, you make a fortune selling Rhapsody's meat. Everyone says it’s delicious.
%if_tales_1_70%	You save the ruined cut for you.
%if_tales_1_71%	It's not delicious at all.
%bed_grethe_hidden_2%	What's going on up there?
%bed_grethe_hidden_5%	My sister is here, she's... well...
%bed_grethe_hidden_6%	She's helping me prepare to run for leader.
%bed_grethe_hidden_7%	What!? That's amazing!
%bed_grethe_hidden_8%	I just know you're going to be a tremendous leader!
%bed_grethe_hidden_9%	Can I help in any way?
%bed_grethe_hidden_11%	Oh, mmm, right, of course. If you want to.
%bed_grethe_hidden_12%	Yes. I feel like this could be a very enriching experience and will allow me to access new lenses to examine reality with.
%bed_grethe_hidden_13%	Hah, nice.
%bed_grethe_hidden_14%	Things are a bit intense up there right now. But when we're done I'll do the introductions and we can see how we can work together, alright?
%bed_grethe_hidden_16%	Great.
%bed_grethe_hidden_17%	I'm looking forward to meeting Patrice.
%bed_grethe_hidden_18%	Hah, brace yourself.
%bed_grethe_hidden_21%	...Can we really meet, though?
%bed_grethe_hidden_22%	Having a Behemoth stuck to my face and all...
%bed_grethe_hidden_23%	Yes.
%bed_grethe_hidden_24%	Don't worry. Patrice will understand.
%bed_grethe_hidden_25%	Ah... ok.
%bed_grethe_hidden_29%	My sister and Dahlia are here. We're preparing Dahlia's campaign to run for leader.
%bed_grethe_hidden_30%	Dahlia is here!? Tell her to come down!
%bed_grethe_hidden_31%	Haha, let us finish with the campaign preparations, we're almost done I think.
%bed_grethe_hidden_32%	Then you come up and surprise everybody.
%bed_grethe_hidden_33%	Haha, ok.
%bed_grethe_hidden_34%	Can't wait to see my sister's face when I introduce to her my first girlfriend after several centuries, hahaha.
%bed_grethe_hidden_35%	Ah, shit, the pressure.
%bed_grethe_hidden_36%	It'll be fine. You're the best.
%bed_grethe_hidden_37%	I love you.
%bed_grethe_hidden_38%	I love you too.
%bed_grethe_hidden_42%	My sister and Jasmine are here. We're preparing Jasmine's campaign, she's running for leader.
%bed_grethe_hidden_44%	Oh! Can I help in any way?
%bed_grethe_hidden_48%	We... We need to be careful, I'm so sorry.
%bed_grethe_hidden_50%	I'm the one who's sorry... holing up here with a Behemoth, I'm putting you at risk.
%bed_grethe_hidden_51%	This campaign thing won't take long... I'm hoping a few months at max?
%bed_grethe_hidden_52%	And I'll do my best to push for a coven where you won't have to hide.
%bed_grethe_hidden_53%	Ah... ok.
%bed_grethe_hidden_54%	Again, I'm sorry.
%bed_grethe_hidden_55%	I'll protect you.
%bed_grethe_hidden_56%	I love you.
%bed_grethe_hidden_57%	I love you too.
%bed_grethe_hidden_60%	...
%bed_grethe_hidden_61%	Fuck.
%bed_grethe_hidden_62%	Are you for real? After she snitched on me?
%bed_grethe_hidden_63%	I know... I'm so sorry, but...
%bed_grethe_hidden_64%	I'm sure Jasmine just wanted to protect the coven.
%bed_grethe_hidden_65%	I can respect that. I also believe Jasmine can do a lot of good for our community.
%bed_grethe_hidden_66%	...
%bed_grethe_hidden_67%	I don't know if I'll ever be able to forgive Jasmine.
%bed_grethe_hidden_68%	But I know one thing.
%bed_grethe_hidden_69%	I trust you.
%bed_grethe_hidden_70%	Also... To be fair...
%bed_demo_novices_2%	"Demographic: Novices"
%bed_demo_novices_3%	"The freshly ascended, Witches in training that still haven't found their calling."
%bed_demo_novices_4%	"Though bear in mind how time works in this immortal society... some novices find their place in the first few years, but some others may take decades."
%bed_demo_novices_5%	"You don't need the approval of anyone to stop being a novice and join the ranks of the producers, academics or explorers."
%bed_demo_novices_6%	"On the other hand, warriors require tests first; and to become an oracle, as you're well aware, another oracle needs to dream about you."
%bed_demo_novices_7%	"Strategy guide: the novices are usually pushed around by the rest of the Witches, so they welcome any initiative that increases their rights and opportunities."
%bed_demo_academics_2%	"Demographic: Academics"
%bed_demo_academics_3%	"Witches so absorbed with the mysteries of this cosmos that they rarely do anything beyond studying it."
%bed_demo_academics_4%	"They are one of the most, if not the most, prestigious demographics, since they're constantly furthering our craft and talents."
%bed_demo_academics_5%	"Although you don't necessarily need to be old to be wise, academics are the oldest demographic on average."
%bed_demo_academics_6%	"You can count them as the biggest elder representation in this race. In fact, Cupressa is one of them, so she may have a slight advantage in this front."
%bed_demo_academics_7%	"Strategy guide: academics like quiet. Control, respect, protocol. They're pretty well off, so they'll welcome anything that maintains the status quo."
%bed_demo_producers_2%	"Demographic: Producers"
%bed_demo_producers_3%	"These Witches have a penchant for milking the cosmos."
%bed_demo_producers_4%	"Be it gardening, mining, sewing or distilling dark matter... you name it. They pride themselves on providing. Without them, we'd all lose many comforts, to be honest."
%bed_demo_producers_5%	"Producers and academics have an almost symbiotic relationship."
%bed_demo_producers_6%	"Producers fund academics' endless research, and in exchange, they reap the latest techniques for furthering the exploitation of this universe."
%bed_demo_producers_7%	"Jasmine is one of them, so she'll have the upper hand with this demographic."
%bed_demo_producers_8%	"Strategy guide: producers have historically felt underappreciated and overworked. To cater to them, increase their quality of life and relevance."
%bed_demo_warriors_2%	"Demographic: Warriors"
%bed_demo_warriors_3%	"Hunters, guardians, soldiers. Specialized in all kinds of combat and cosmic warfare."
%bed_demo_warriors_4%	"They keep us safe, provide rare materials from Daemons and other dangerous beings, and they also craft weapons."
%bed_demo_warriors_5%	"It's the hardest group to belong to, as it's a very demanding occupation. We barely count a dozen in our coven."
%bed_demo_warriors_6%	"Dahlia is one of them, and I'm sure she'll have their undying support no matter what."
%bed_demo_warriors_7%	"Strategy guide: Warriors are extremely loyal, so... unless something exceptional happens, they're going to be on Dahlia's side."
%bed_demo_explorers_2%	"Demographic: Explorers"
%bed_demo_explorers_3%	"These witches continuously chart this cosmos."
%bed_demo_explorers_4%	"Explorers scout new locations, discover new sources of energy and materials, and keep us informed of the latest events around every galaxy."
%bed_demo_explorers_5%	"They're usually too busy to mess with politics, so anything goes for them as long as it doesn't hinder their endeavors."
%bed_demo_explorers_6%	"Strategy guide: they're pretty easy, throw them a bone here and there and they'll support us... Although the same goes for the other parties, too."
%bed_demo_oracles_2%	"Demographic: Oracles"
%bed_demo_oracles_3%	"I shouldn't have to tell you about the oracles, since they're your lot."
%bed_demo_oracles_4%	"They also happen to be the most reclusive of all Witches, so you're not really a community, per se."
%bed_demo_oracles_5%	"Oracles are the least abundant faction in our coven, since one can't choose to be an oracle."
%bed_demo_oracles_6%	"The only way in is for the cosmos to choose for you to become one."
%bed_demo_oracles_7%	"Oracles, with their premonitions and hunches, usually play a supportive role, counseling any Witch who's at a crossroads."
%bed_demo_oracles_8%	"...In reality, what you are is the sisterhood's therapists."
%bed_demo_oracles_9%	"Strategy guide: This demographic is unpredictable. I don't know if it's worth investing time in catering to oracles."
%bed_demo_oracles_10%	"...Although if you do, I bet you could sway them easily just out of sympathy."
%bed_demo_hub_2%	I read every analysis already.
%bed_demo_hub_3%	What should I review?
%bed_demo_hub_6%	Novices.
%bed_demo_hub_7%	Academics.

%bed_demo_hub_10%	Explorers.

%if_tales_2_2%	"Tickles" by Emma Ríos.
%if_tales_2_3%	Back and forth, this wooden husk I take my naps in wandered adrift in an endless, mercyless sea.
%if_tales_2_5%	Swayed by fate, we both aspired to meet a destination. For that we survived storms, dodged leviathans, ignored decline, hunger and thirst.
%if_tales_2_6%	Inspiration burnt our souls making us survive by and for desire. But the infinite happiness of meeting a goal doesn't last long.
%if_tales_2_7%	Now, here I laze. Longing for a reawakening.
%if_tales_2_8%	I think the messenger is back, but maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me again.
%if_tales_2_9%	This little friend is a dissonant note in the everyday routine of doing nothing, barely feeling and being bored to death. Once, it even tickled!
%if_tales_2_10%	In truth, it's been days since I could move my limbs. Since I started feeling so exhausted.
%if_tales_2_11%	I can but lie under the sun, in wait for a less blinding starry night, stirred by somehow noticing another living being close. The little bird lights me up inside.
%if_tales_2_12%	I gave this friend the title of "hope bringer." An anticipation of a well-earned rest shorewards, on more quiet grounds.
%if_tales_2_13%	The wet valley tricked me into believing I'm a mariner, one that has seen better days. However, any recollection of my past keeps fading fast.
%if_tales_2_14%	I'm lucky I can still listen, the sea teaches you to let things flow.
%if_tales_2_15%	The tide goes up and down, but every drop has to go ashore at some point to kiss the dry land.
%if_tales_2_16%	My boat did it recently, so say the new whispers of the waves. And the storm, and the wood finally cracking and stumbling upon a sandbank.
%if_tales_2_17%	"A kiss" is a bit too passionate for my taste. I wonder if I have ever kissed someone... I like kissing gently.
%if_tales_2_18%	Ha, ha! Look at all this drama! My old self still tries to spur their memories.
%if_tales_2_19%	I'm adrift but happy to have missed the whole intensity of the wreckage. The numbness in my limbs keeps the pain at bay, but they can still "tickle."
%if_tales_2_20%	Isn't touch nice? Feeling another fellow, even scarcely. Like those little claws grazing softly all over me.
%if_tales_2_21%	If only I could touch its feathers to return such a beautiful gift... If only a friend could still be within my grasp.
%if_tales_2_22%	Please tell me, little bird. Should I endure or should I give up? I'm...
%if_tales_2_25%	... cursed.
%if_tales_2_26%	... graced.
%if_tales_2_30%	My arm stretches out with a mind of its own. It craves purpose.
%if_tales_2_34%	There are so many things I still yearn for!
%if_tales_2_35%	To feel alive I only need to let go of the tissues and tendons that bind me.
%if_tales_2_36%	Unstick myself from these bones.
%if_tales_2_37%	Look at me, little bird! I cheat the laws of gravit--!!
%if_tales_2_39%	Hush, hush... Stupid turnstone bird, isn't there enough fish in the sea that you needn’t eat from a corpse? -- OH MY GOD, that's a woman talking!
%if_tales_2_40%	Look at all this mess... -- She doesn't seem to notice me... Should I start a conversation? It would be very rude otherwise.
%if_tales_2_41%	E-ExcUSe me, miss... -- My voice crawls out of my throat, as broken as the rest of what's left of me -- ThESe deaDened sensES don't allOw me to pro...
%if_tales_2_42%	... tO pRo-proPerly inTRodUce myselF bUt-t... -- Why do I suddenly sound so eerie?!
%if_tales_2_43%	AHH--! A talking ghost!! -- Oh no, I made this poor woman jump in fright!
%if_tales_2_44%	I-I-I-I'm sO-oRry, I diDn't mEaN-an to sCAre yoU... -- Whoa, is she trying to hit me with her stick? -- ... p-plEAse put yOUr cane AWay-y.
%if_tales_2_45%	Be careful of who you startle to death, spooky! -- What a Witch I am! Since when can a simple shadow catch me off guard?!
%if_tales_2_46%	Listen ghost, I put a hex on my crone's heart. If it jumps out of this chest, our arteries will have your SOBS strangled in eternal PAIN!!
%if_tales_2_47%	She keeps waving that staff. She truly wants to kill me! -- p-P-pLEasE s-sStop...!
%if_tales_2_48%	doN't hURt me, I bEg yOu-ou!!
%if_tales_2_49%	We are trouble, you know? Old hags. -- Why is this person threatening me? What did I do to her?! --I-I mEAnt yOu nO hArM, i SWeaR...
%if_tales_2_50%	Who's terrified now, ghost? Not this old crow! It's been a while since my last exorcism but at least I haven’t lost my touch.
%if_tales_2_51%	I was mercyless when I was young, feared on both sides of existence. Not for power, not for greed, not by choice.
%if_tales_2_52%	The world and the underworld both hate magic. Nonetheless, I cared and committed to educate losers who wouldn't let me live my life on my own terms.
%if_tales_2_53%	Far and wide, ignorance makes one arrogant. Daring, cruel, a goddamn cretin. I was enduring. Then I became hell.
%if_tales_2_54%	What reason was there to let their bitter fear erase who I am? Call me a hoodlum, I made them all...
%if_tales_2_57%	...cursed.
%if_tales_2_58%	...graced.
%if_tales_2_62%	... i'M sO sCAred mYSelF! -- Are you, imp? Serves you right.
%if_tales_2_64%	PlEAse, I nEed hELp-p. I dON't kNOw-w w-WHaT'ss haPPenINg to me. why dO I sPEak thIS-s weIRDly-ly...? -- Wait... Don't tell me...
%if_tales_2_65%	You cALLed me a g-g-ghost, am I TRuly...? -- Shit.
%if_tales_2_66%	... oH gODS, OHh goDS-s  -- Indeed, it looked way too shaken for a creature from the afterlife. The poor fellow may have just died.
%if_tales_2_67%	It doesn't happen very often, but the phantom amnesia can turn the coldest assassin into a pure gentle mind.
%if_tales_2_68%	Unaware of any harm they may have done, of any pain they may have suffered, of any mistake to feel remorse over...
%if_tales_2_69%	Ghosts become too sensitive for this world -- Hey, don't cr...
%if_tales_2_70%	Please, don't cry! -- I was a bit of a bully -- I got scared and I overreacted!
%if_tales_2_71%	You're so translucent I could barely see you. Not all of us are the considerate type. Old people don't give a shit, we forget to be nice.
%if_tales_2_72%	There's something more pathetic than a necromancer losing her shit... --Ahem...
%if_tales_2_73%	A necromancer feeling embarrassed. -- For that I'm sorry.
%if_tales_2_74%	n-nO, iT'S mY fAULt-Lt. I cAn't sEe vERy wEll-ell eiTHer-er, e-e-everYtHIng f-fEEls so confFUsing.
%if_tales_2_75%	iF I oFFended yOU i aPOlogize-e. fAr bE it fROm me-e to huRT AnYOne-one.
%if_tales_2_76%	A skiff with a rotting passenger that happens to be well-mannered and gentle.
%if_tales_2_77%	It's all cool, don't worry -- Unbinding this poor soul is going to be more difficult than I thought...
%if_tales_2_78%	Your kind... -- "My kind" she just said -- ... see the world just like we see you: blurrily. That's why you get lost so often -- I must be levitating over my corpse.
%if_tales_2_79%	Do I reek? I’m sure I do. I can't even smell the sea! This is so embarrassing...
%if_tales_2_80%	i-i-Is it n-nORmAl fOR tHe dePArtEd to feEl beNUmBed-ed?
%if_tales_2_81%	Fate always takes its toll on our senses, little ghost.
%if_tales_2_82%	Look at me, one foot in the grave and yet my brain furiously believes I'm still in my twenties! -- How can I compare myself? This poor soul is dead.
%if_tales_2_83%	Stinky. Rotten. Beyond repair.
%if_tales_2_84%	Trying to grasp a glimpse of existence for a reason. To finish something. To claim our desire. Perhaps to be still worthy of being loved.
%if_tales_2_85%	a-AcTUalLy, I can't remEmBEr-r how old I wAS-s wHEn...
%if_tales_2_86%	Age is irrelevant, spooky. There's only one way to die a peaceful death, and that is to choose it yourself.
%if_tales_2_87%	For the rest of us there's always something.
%if_tales_2_88%	A dream, a promise, something to make amends for.
%if_tales_2_89%	Witches or ghosts. We are all...
%if_tales_2_92%	... cursed.
%if_tales_2_93%	... graced.
%if_tales_2_97%	We can't help it, my friend. The living and the dead, we are all adrift in the wild...
%if_tales_2_98%	She just called me "her friend." If I had a heart it would have skipped a beat.
%if_tales_2_100%	Whether it’s for little pleasures or trials to overcome, the living and the dead treasure every second of consciousness -- How could you not be a form of life?
%if_tales_2_101%	I'm but a fool. An old hag trying to cheer up a specter by getting depressed herself... -- Would you mind if I smoke?
%if_tales_2_102%	Oh nO, n-nOT aT all-ll. I c-cOUldn't stop tHinKing abOUt my boDy sMeLLing...
%if_tales_2_103%	Ha, ha... Aren't you an anxious one? What a dumb thing to worry about.
%if_tales_2_104%	She's so kind. Pretty cool, too. Smoking fancily right beside me like the heroine of the story. I could blush...
%if_tales_2_105%	Tell me something about you, little ghost ...
%if_tales_2_106%	... Your voice comes along with a strange echo that tickles in my ears and reverberates a somewhat sweet melancholy.
%if_tales_2_107%	It feels akin to my own sadness.
%if_tales_2_108%	WOW, NOW I'M BLUSHING.
%if_tales_2_109%	O-oh, tHAnKs... -- Wait.  Why am I taking this as a compliment? -- ... I-I-I thOUghT my vOIce sOUndEd trULy aWKward-rd.
%if_tales_2_110%	I think it's beautiful --Even if she’s only trying to be kind, I feel so relieved.
%if_tales_2_111%	How long has it been since someone was nice to me?
%if_tales_2_112%	A sadness akin. A final memory to treasure.
%if_tales_2_113%	ThEre's not so mUCh-ch I can tell, I've beEn conScious-s all this tIMe but also forGetFul.
%if_tales_2_114%	I maDe it here thANks to a littLe frienD-d. But now tHat I have-ve acKNowleDged myself...
%if_tales_2_115%	I feel I haVe lost-t my bIRd forEVer.
%if_tales_2_116%	Damn... I am such a stupid woman-- I sent your bird away because it was eating from you. I'm sorry.
%if_tales_2_117%	No prObLEm-em, my fLESh-h is nOT ve-eRy hEALThy-y.
%if_tales_2_118%	Was that supposed to make me feel better, spooky?
%if_tales_2_119%	C-cAn I AsK you-u-u sOMetHing-g?
%if_tales_2_120%	Sure... Whatever you want.
%if_tales_2_121%	A-Are yOU hERE to vaniSH me-e?

%if_tales_2_125%	Wasn't that poetic? I have a soft spot for artists.
%if_tales_2_126%	I'm a sea Witch. It’s my job to take care of the ones like you.
%if_tales_2_127%	I must pull out the ribs protecting your heart to make a broth in salt water. I must bless the branch of a willow to whack your boat with.
%if_tales_2_128%	I must bury you under the tree so its roots tie your spirit forever.
%if_tales_2_129%	I u-unDErsTand.

%if_tales_2_131%	No. You understand nothing, spooky...
%if_tales_2_132%	I'm discarded myself. Forsaken by people I loved who willingly traded me for busy lives and for feeling invulnerable.
%if_tales_2_133%	I have at least 5 years left.
%if_tales_2_134%	I'm in a position to rebel.
%if_tales_2_135%	If I had breath, she'd have taken it away.
%if_tales_2_136%	I wish ghosts couldn't cry. It feels so embarrassing.
%if_tales_2_137%	Heyy, again? There's no need to be this dramatic!
%if_tales_2_138%	I didn't want to. I'm...
%if_tales_2_141%	... cursed.

%if_tales_2_149%	To live is to be scared, spooky. But if we keep taking the next step we may find something to gain for ourselves.
%if_tales_2_150%	I'm not kind, I'm bored. I want someone to tell me stories.
%if_tales_2_151%	CAW CAW
%if_tales_2_152%	Look who's back. This bird is too lazy to catch fish by itself.
%if_tales_2_153%	I thought I didn't have stories to tell her, but I have at least one.
%if_tales_2_154%	It's about a little bird that gave a ghost some hope to live.
%if_tales_2_155%	I wOUld GLadLy try to mAKe up sTOries to sPEak wiTH yOu as fRienDS.
%if_tales_2_161%	I'm sORry-ry, I doN't waNT-t tO be sAd-d...

%if_tales_2_166%	Fair enough.
%if_tales_2_167%	I meant to be altruistic, but I was doing it for myself. To ease my own compassion.
%if_tales_2_168%	Don't worry, dear. To live is to have a choice.
%if_tales_2_169%	I am dEAd-ead. CaN I trULy chOose to cEASe to eXIst?
%if_tales_2_170%	Her hand feels so warm.
%if_tales_2_171%	You are alive to me, and I can totally walk you peacefully to oblivion.
%if_tales_3_2%	"The Hand of the World" by Eva Cid
%if_tales_3_3%	The girl was ambling along the path, shrouded in the smoky haze of dawn. She was crying.
%if_tales_3_4%	The words of Father still echoed in her head. The warmth of his last kiss still beat on her cheek.
%if_tales_3_5%	"Since you were born, I knew there was something strange about you. It's time for you to join your kind." And, without further ado, Father left her in the thick of the night.
%if_tales_3_6%	The path was narrow and marked a trail that was easy to follow but hard to swallow, a slight furrow of land that led to a whole new life.
%if_tales_3_7%	After hours of walking, the girl stumbled upon the knocker of a trap door on the ground, right where the path ended.
%if_tales_3_8%	It was a beautiful and antique-looking piece. A hand carved in bronze holding a sphere between its fingers. A globe.
%if_tales_3_9%	She pulled gently, and the hatch reacted to her touch by opening diligently. The globe was waiting for her.
%if_tales_3_10%	The girl entered the blackness beneath the floor, groping the height of the steps until she emerged into a dimly lit room.
%if_tales_3_11%	As her eyes became used to the gloom, she spotted the hunched silhouette of a woman at the back of a vaulted chamber.
%if_tales_3_12%	"Welcome, my child. From now on, you will be the daughter of another flesh, the sister of another blood. Are you ready for the initiation rite?"
%if_tales_3_15%	No. I want to go back home.
%if_tales_3_16%	I have no choice.
%if_tales_3_20%	"That's not possible. You have belonged to our sisterhood since you were a seed. Now you have to blossom here."
%if_tales_3_22%	"You carry within you the primordial force that secretly rules this world, but such a power needs to be tamed."
%if_tales_3_23%	"Power requires sacrifice, just as the world needs balance."
%if_tales_3_24%	The woman approached her. Her skin was wrinkled like the ridges of a freshly plowed field.
%if_tales_3_25%	"The force rests in the space between pairs of opposites. We must relinquish one of our senses to focus that force."
%if_tales_3_26%	"Sight and hearing govern the rationality of people. Smell and taste drive their emotions."
%if_tales_3_27%	The girl struggled to understand. "What about touch?"
%if_tales_3_28%	"That is the only sense we cannot renounce. We are the hand that subtly rules the becoming. It is the tool for channeling our magic."
%if_tales_3_29%	The girl scrutinized the woman's face, wondering what her choice would have been and what kind of magic she would flaunt.
%if_tales_3_30%	She thought it would be easier to live without some senses than others. Surely there was a catch.
%if_tales_3_31%	"Do not be afraid. Look inside yourself, and you will know the right choice," said the woman.
%if_tales_3_34%	"Should I do without the exquisite taste of the succulent fruits of the Earth?"
%if_tales_3_35%	"Should I do without the countless fragrances with which nature enraptures us?"

%if_tales_3_37%	"Should I do without the reliable witness of my eyes, the crystalline window between me and the world?"
%if_tales_3_41%	"You have chosen to forego the sense of taste, the voluptuous tongue that shapes dark affections."
%if_tales_3_42%	"Your renunciation will also be your force, because only from humility and detachment can you exercise power."
%if_tales_3_43%	"From now on, you will be able to appease or insufflate the fire of hate, grief, and sorrow."

%if_tales_3_50%	"From now on, you will be able to color the nuances of desires and nurture them with meaning."

%if_tales_4_2%	"Last One Standing" by Giada Zavarise
%if_tales_4_3%	When your people started dying, they did it without a whimper, vanishing like fruits plucked by invisible hands.
%if_tales_4_4%	As the lead hunter, you led a squad of your best men into the jungle. You returned alone, an entire squadron of warriors gone while your back was turned.
%if_tales_4_5%	"Must be a giant snake, swallowing them whole," said the village chief, for the predator left no traces, no sounds, and not even the bones of its victims.
%if_tales_4_6%	When your people started disappearing from their own huts, they stopped believing in animals and started believing in monsters.
%if_tales_4_7%	Some prayed. Others tried to leave the island, only to be killed by the waves. You sharpened your spear and kept your eyes peeled.
%if_tales_4_8%	You are the only human being still alive on this island. But you are not alone.
%if_tales_4_9%	You can feel its gaze on your skin while you sleep. You saw the monster itself a couple times, as you scoured the island - a flick of a tail, a glint of eyes in the woods.
%if_tales_4_10%	And now you have finally found it: a big coil of ink and smoke, resting on a flat rock in the middle of a meadow.
%if_tales_4_11%	You are the lead hunter, but you have never killed a beast like this. A snake, yes, but one made of dark waters and whispers and faded dreams.
%if_tales_4_12%	"I am so sorry. I was so hungry," the monster laments, voice as soft as the night. "I ate and ate and realized too late that there is no food left, except for you."
%if_tales_4_13%	The shock of hearing it speak makes your hand shake.
%if_tales_4_14%	"If I kill you, I'll starve. And if you kill me, you will remain alone, without even revenge to keep you company."
%if_tales_4_15%	The monster regards you with its many eyes. "Let me eat one of your fingers, so our doomed chase may continue for a while."
%if_tales_4_18%	Accept.
%if_tales_4_19%	Attack.
%if_tales_4_24%	The monster lowers its head, taking your finger in its maw with a gentleness that makes you squirm.
%if_tales_4_25%	You don't even feel pain. Your finger is simply gone - and a blink and a grin later, the creature disappears as well.
%if_tales_4_29%	You lift your spear and throw it at the creature, aiming for the head. It recoils with a hiss, your spear stuck in one eye.
%if_tales_4_30%	A blink later, it's gone. Your spear is on the ground, wet with blood that looks and tastes like ink.
%if_tales_4_34%	The next day you resume the chase, a knife hanging on your belt, your gaze set on the tallest peak of the island.
%if_tales_4_35%	You spend most of your morning climbing higher and higher, looking for a cave where a night-creature could sleep.
%if_tales_4_36%	Your foot slips and an instant later you're upside-down, and there's blood in your mouth and pain in your head.
%if_tales_4_37%	You fell into a chasm and broke something during the fall.
%if_tales_4_38%	A chuckle. You twist your body, straining your neck to peek at the monster looking at you from the ridge of the cliff.
%if_tales_4_39%	It looks different than before. More swollen, and yet less solid. Stretched thin.
%if_tales_4_41%	"I am too weak to help you." A mournful laugh. "It doesn't even feel fair, to eat you like this."
%if_tales_4_42%	The creature slides down, but instead of opening its maw it spreads its coils, enveloping you in a kind, cool embrace.
%if_tales_4_43%	You fall asleep and dream of stars. You never wake up.
%if_tales_4_48%	The creature slides down the cliff and wraps you in its coils, lifting you up. It only releases you once you're safe, your back propped against the wall of a cave.
%if_tales_4_49%	"I am so sorry," the monster whispers, huddling beside your bleeding body. "I was so hungry. I am always hungry. It hurts so much."
%if_tales_4_50%	Something pokes you from behind: your knife, still sheathed at your belt.
%if_tales_4_53%	Rest and recover.
%if_tales_4_54%	Attack the monster.
%if_tales_4_59%	You ignore the creature and shut your eyes, trying to rest and regain your energy. You hear the creature sing moments before you fall asleep.
%if_tales_4_63%	You plunge your knife into the monster's coils, and it feels no different than parting the dark ocean with a blade.
%if_tales_4_64%	You bleed out together, side by side, red and ink mixing together to create colorful swirls that almost look beautiful under the fading sun.
%if_tales_4_65%	"Was it a good chase?" the monster asks you with one last smile.
%if_tales_4_70%	When you wake up, your bleeding has stopped, and the monster is gone.
%if_tales_4_71%	You crawl out of the cave and see a still sea, a lonely boat painted on the horizon.
%if_tales_4_72%	You hurry to gather green branches and light a fire, filling the sky with heavy smoke. The boat turns towards the island.
%if_tales_4_73%	As you prepare yourself for the long climb down, a voice behind you:
%if_tales_4_75%	"You're leaving? But what of our chase?" asks the creature, now barely a faded shadow. More a concept than a living being. "You'll feel so alone without me."
%if_tales_4_78%	Chase after the beast.
%if_tales_4_79%	Leave.
%if_tales_4_83%	You turn your back to the beach and plunge back into the jungle, knife in hand, heart bouncing in your chest.
%if_tales_4_84%	The creature starts running.
%if_tales_4_89%	You turn your back to the monster and head towards the beach, where a lifeboat is bound to reach the shore soon.
%if_tales_4_90%	Your spear falls from your hands. Behind you, you can hear the monster crying. You don't look back.
%if_tales_4_95%	"I'm sorry," the creature sobs, now barely a faded shadow. The three small shapes following it, on the other hand, look horribly real.
%if_tales_4_96%	"They're so hungry," the monster explains, as the three creatures start crawling on your legs. "They're just so hungry. It hurts so much."
%if_tales_5_2%	"Penelope" by Giada Zavarise.
%if_tales_5_3%	Your lover left you on a bright summer's day, kissing you on the cheek before sailing away.
%if_tales_5_4%	An evil to vanquish, no time for love! But to you the hero said "please wait for me, my dove."
%if_tales_5_5%	A ring, a promise, a marriage to await...
%if_tales_5_8%	And waiting you did, respecting your fate.
%if_tales_5_9%	But you never were one to wait.
%if_tales_5_13%	You found yourself another partner, a country boy. An uneventful life, yet filled with joy.
%if_tales_5_14%	Of your hero you heard stories, plays, and songs fit for dance; but you never spared them a second glance.
%if_tales_5_19%	Heroic deeds detailed in the letters piling at your doorway, coming from lands more and more far away.
%if_tales_5_20%	Castles conquered, demons defeated! Yet the quest never seemed to be completed.
%if_tales_5_21%	A certain tiredness emanating from the writing. Work well-done, meaningful, yet hardly inviting.
%if_tales_5_22%	Your ring was starting to lose its shine; love receding like your thinning hairline.
%if_tales_5_25%	But the waiting, to you, was fine.
%if_tales_5_26%	The betrothal, you had to decline.
%if_tales_5_30%	Guilty for wasting your youth, or for not waiting enough? It kept you up at night, the regretful afterthought.
%if_tales_5_31%	Too old for marriage, you settled for less: Some chickens, a field, the wind's gentle caress.
%if_tales_5_32%	And while your hero never returned to thee, in your dreams, at last, you two lived free.
%if_tales_5_37%	With time the letters were growing more desperate: "Love, I truly hope I'm not too late."
%if_tales_5_38%	Would he even recognize the love you were holding? The knowledge that life is not only about longing?
%if_tales_5_39%	Next winter, he was sure, he was coming home at last, thirty-seven years, gone too fast.
%if_tales_5_40%	If the future you waited for looked so bright, why did you keep waking in the middle of the night?
%if_tales_5_43%	To weird anxieties, you gave no weight.
%if_tales_5_44%	You had to flee, there was no time to wait.
%if_tales_5_48%	You fled from your future, reason unknown, the beating in your chest having a will of its own.
%if_tales_5_49%	You became an adventurer, did this and that. Sent him a letter; told him to wait for you to get back.
%if_tales_5_54%	The much awaited day: finally he was back! He looked at you, smiled, then died of a heart attack.
%if_tales_6_2%	"Unholy Exorcism" by Giada Zavarise.
%if_tales_6_3%	You thought you knew your demons. You spent your whole life exorcizing them.
%if_tales_6_4%	Duke Baythim, the serpent-tailed. Earl Fufur, the winged deer. Duke Murmur, who rides a griffin. Beelzebub, surrounded by flies.
%if_tales_6_5%	But you had no name for the monster inhabiting the girl in front of you. For the wheel of fire in her eyes, the pale glow emanating from her skin.
%if_tales_6_6%	She was tied to her bed, pale and still as a corpse. When she spoke, she let words fall from her mouth, like pieces of glass.
%if_tales_6_7%	"Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy."
%if_tales_6_8%	She smiled a terrible smile, too white and too calm, sparkles dancing on her lips like brine.
%if_tales_6_9%	"We are an angel on a holy mission to learn what it means to be human. We have chosen this girl as our host, to allow us to experience the world through her."
%if_tales_6_11%	You let the creature speak.
%if_tales_6_12%	You attempted to exorcize it.
%if_tales_6_16%	And the Angel said the girl shall now live her life in a state of perpetual bliss, mind shrouded in ecstasy while her body wandered.
%if_tales_6_17%	A brief existence, for human flesh is not made to host angels; but oh, what a blessing, to be the living receptacle of a miracle!
%if_tales_6_18%	She did not ask for this, yet could not hope for a better life.
%if_tales_6_22%	You sang your prayers, waved your crosses and invoked the Lord's name to drive this creature away. You begged and growled and sang until your throat grew sore.
%if_tales_6_23%	The girl smirked, peaceful, your words hitting her like a warm shower.
%if_tales_6_24%	Either the creature's words were true, and it really was an angel, or it was a devil like one you've never witnessed before: an apocalypse in the shape of a teen.
%if_tales_6_28%	The girl was only thirteen.
%if_tales_6_31%	That's why you had to slit her throat.
%if_tales_6_32%	That's why you brought her here.
%if_tales_6_33%	That's why you told the Angel to take your body instead.
%if_tales_6_37%	That's why you're now standing in front of the Vatican council, confessing to murder, asking for mercy.
%if_tales_6_38%	You did not know how to save her body. But innocent souls always go to heaven.
%if_tales_6_43%	That's why you are now in front of the Vatican council with the girl in tow, telling your superiors she's blessed, holy, a saint and a living miracle.
%if_tales_6_44%	You try not to meet her gaze. Most of the time she's peaceful, but occasionally she looks as if she's about to scream.
%if_tales_6_49%	That's why you are here now, in front of the Vatican council, eyes full of fire and light coating your skin.
%if_tales_6_50%	"Be not afraid," you say, but it's not really you anymore.
%if_tales_7_2%	"THE META-NET" by Clara Doña.
%if_tales_7_3%	The Meta-net is the largest social and neurological network in the world. It keeps you hyper connected in the present. In exchange, your past is fading away.
%if_tales_7_4%	There is someone in the realms of the past you do not want to forget about. It seems contradictory, but you have been feeling ever so lonely.
%if_tales_7_5%	The cards in the hyper-reality tarot do not lie: he is important. You know well to trust the readings of the algorithm.
%if_tales_7_6%	There is a sacrifice to be made. All the links you have built in the network, all the people you know will be lost forever in data oblivion.
%if_tales_7_7%	Except they won't. You download all the data of your years in the Meta-net, all the names and avatars and interactions and moments shared.
%if_tales_7_8%	This encyclopedia of your life online will be printed in Reality, ready for you when you leave.
%if_tales_7_9%	The person you are trying to find is somewhere in the data. You met him in the online lands. But he left the Meta-net, back to Reality. He felt his life there was not enough.
%if_tales_7_10%	You are going to do the same, right? It feels like the correct thing to do.
%if_tales_7_14%	Stay in the Meta-net. All these people need you connected.
%if_tales_7_15%	Leave for Reality. You need to find him.
%if_tales_7_18%	Staying feels wrong, but you do it.
%if_tales_7_19%	Years down the line you feel lonelier than ever.
%if_tales_7_20%	In a fluctuation of the economic systems, the market for Meta-net crashes. Everyone disconnects.
%if_tales_7_24%	You are ready to take a look back at Reality. It must have been forever. Time warps in the Meta-net.
%if_tales_7_25%	You do it. You turn off your network. You remove all the systems that kept you connected from your head.
%if_tales_7_26%	The loneliness feels overwhelming in a home you had forgotten.
%if_tales_7_27%	The beam of natural light coming through the window is unbearable.
%if_tales_7_28%	But then you see the Outsiders through the window.
%if_tales_7_29%	The Outsiders never adapted to the Meta-net. You watch them go about their disconnected lives. Maybe it's not so bad out here.
%if_tales_7_30%	Time starts moving at a measurable pace. You love clocks. You remember when they took them away in the Meta-net. But you don't remember much more.
%if_tales_7_31%	Days go by and you remember how to do some basic stuff to survive outside.
%if_tales_7_35%	Remember you loved eating.
%if_tales_7_36%	Remember you loved cooking.
%if_tales_7_40%	You gain access to memories of your favorite dish and happy dinner times.
%if_tales_7_44%	You gain access to memories of evenings spent learning how to prepare your mother's recipe.
%if_tales_7_48%	There is a warmth you have not felt in a long time.
%if_tales_7_49%	But there is something you are forgetting...
%if_tales_7_50%	Days go by and you remember your corporeal form.
%if_tales_7_54%	Remember you loved your hair.
%if_tales_7_55%	Remember you loved your body.
%if_tales_7_59%	You gain access to memories of time spent in front of the mirror admiring your hair, touching it.
%if_tales_7_63%	You gain access to memories of time spent in front of the mirror admiring your body, touching it.
%if_tales_7_67%	There is a sense of security you have not felt in a long time.
%if_tales_7_68%	But there is something you are forgetting...
%if_tales_7_69%	Days go by and you remember pleasures.
%if_tales_7_73%	Remember you loved nature.
%if_tales_7_74%	Remember you loved the city.
%if_tales_7_78%	You gain access to memories of time spent walking through the fields and the forest near your house.
%if_tales_7_82%	You gain access to memories of time spent walking around the city, meeting people, going to libraries and museums.
%if_tales_7_86%	There is a feeling of freedom you have not felt in a long time.
%if_tales_7_87%	But there is someone you are forgetting...
%if_tales_7_88%	It feels good out here. The Meta-net feels like a bad dream that you escaped.
%if_tales_7_89%	It comes with the realization that the Meta-net and Reality are incompatible. Everyday your memory of it fades.
%if_tales_7_90%	But something doesn't feel right. You do not want the Meta-net to disappear from your memory entirely.
%if_tales_7_91%	Then you remember your encyclopedia. A history book of your past self waiting to be read.
%if_tales_7_92%	You printed it before you disconnected. Filled to the brim with data, innumerable sheets sit in your printer.
%if_tales_7_93%	And that triggers a remembrance of him. You were so caught up adapting and enjoying reality that you had forgotten. His name, avatar, and your past together have to be there somewhere.
%if_tales_7_94%	But if you had forgotten, is he really that important? Do you really want to go back and look at a past that you would prefer to lose sight of?
%if_tales_7_97%	The past can stay where it is. You are forgetting it for a reason. He is not that important. You burn the sheets in your garden.
%if_tales_7_98%	You need the past. You saved it for a reason. He is important. You gather the sheets from the printer.
%if_tales_7_102%	You appreciate the smell of burning paper. The change of the wind that moves the flames. The heat in your hands.
%if_tales_7_103%	The years spent in the Meta-net with its sensory deprivation have made you appreciate the Reality that surrounds you more vividly.
%if_tales_7_104%	If you are bound to forget the past, you might as well forget it soon.
%if_tales_7_109%	It takes you days to put the sheets together. Their volume is colossal. The weight in your hands makes you shiver. Years of your life minutely detailed.
%if_tales_7_110%	You wonder how you would find his name among billions of data points.
%if_tales_7_111%	You start to look at the sheets. The lack of time in the Meta-net makes it near impossible to order them chronologically. But there is something else...
%if_tales_7_112%	So much of it you could have remembered or recognized when you were connected. Outside, you realize, it makes nearly no sense.
%if_tales_7_113%	Days go by and you manage to piece together small timelines, tiny interactions of a life spent online. Some lingo you recognise, but most of it seems like an ancient language.
%if_tales_7_114%	None of the data feels like him. But you start to wonder if you would be able to recognize it now if you had it in front of you.
%if_tales_7_115%	Months later you start to forget even what you had put together.
%if_tales_7_116%	Words and names escape you, avatars look nightmarish, the sole purpose of the task starts to slip from your memory.
%if_tales_7_117%	You don't remember him anymore.
%if_tales_7_118%	Years later you look at the pages, scrutinizing their purpose. The encyclopedia of data sits in your library among fiction novels.
%if_tales_8_2%	"HYPER-REALITY READINGS" by Clara Doña.
%if_tales_8_3%	A human is back at their workplace. They look at the screen for hours. The algorithm is not enough. The readings have been failing.
%if_tales_8_4%	The machine needs human insights in order to be accurate. The hyper-reality tarot needs the magic of emotional perception.
%if_tales_8_5%	It's just another day at work, providing the sorcery of providence and guidance to those who seek it.
%if_tales_8_6%	The cases start coming in for the human-algorithm team and you, the hand of destiny, luck or magic.
%if_tales_8_7%	Case 0015997. They are a young professional who doesn't know how to further their career.
%if_tales_8_8%	The case asks the tarot if they should leave their current employer or stay.
%if_tales_8_9%	The algorithm always makes its reading first. It takes nanoseconds to analyze the cases’ evidence.
%if_tales_8_10%	It suggests the Temperance card: Balance, purpose, patience. It has found data to suggest they should stay at their current place of work.
%if_tales_8_11%	It has looked into their data, consisting of pictures and endless lines of conversation. They have a family to feed and a precarious economic situation.
%if_tales_8_12%	Then it's the human's turn. He wants to challenge that. The tarot algorithm is widely trusted to analyze objective data, but not emotional data.
%if_tales_8_13%	The human looks into their file for emotional cues, the choice of words in their conversations.
%if_tales_8_14%	The human finds search data every night, at about 4 am. Case 0015997 can't sleep, looking desperately for another job. The human suggests Death upright: change.
%if_tales_8_15%	The algorithm is programmed to trust you. The human believes you are just a higher power who chooses the right answers.
%if_tales_8_18%	Temperance upright. Keep their job.
%if_tales_8_19%	Death upright. Quit and look for a change.
%if_tales_8_23%	A soft hum in the head of Case 0015997. The tarot reading is suggesting the opposite of what they had thought. The decision had been made before the reading.
%if_tales_8_24%	You will never know what happened in the end, anyway.
%if_tales_8_28%	Case 0015998. He is a retired man of advanced age who feels like his past self is trying to communicate with him through the reflections in the windows in his house.
%if_tales_8_29%	The case asks the tarot if he should cover the windows and forget about it or open them to let him in.
%if_tales_8_30%	The algorithm suggests the Hanged Man card, reversed. Exploring his dark thoughts. It has found data to suggest he should open the windows.
%if_tales_8_31%	The case owns various tomes about dark arts, and has searched the net for rituals to summon otherworldly beings.
%if_tales_8_32%	The human challenges that again: he would be shocked that the algorithm is suggesting such a thing, if he hadn't seen it working for years.
%if_tales_8_33%	The human looks into the man's file for emotional cues, the choice of words in his conversations. He finds none, as the man has no conversations.
%if_tales_8_34%	There is only evidence to support the algorithm's thesis, but the human will not agree. Instead, the human suggests Judgment upright.
%if_tales_8_35%	The man should reflect upon himself, his past and his decisions.
%if_tales_8_36%	He should realize he is lonely and unwell, and maybe then act to transform his reality. And he should definitely keep the windows closed.
%if_tales_8_37%	Once again, you are the overseeing hand, the hand of luck, perhaps the hand of providence.
%if_tales_8_40%	Hanged Man reversed. Open the window.
%if_tales_8_41%	Judgment upright. Keep the window shut.
%if_tales_8_45%	Case 0015998 stops responding after the reading. You don't know if he received the message or if he had disconnected beforehand.
%if_tales_8_46%	You will never know what happened in the end, anyway.
%if_tales_8_50%	Case 0015999. A tarot reader. She asks if her readings are making a change in the world. There is a perceptible trembling in her online being.
%if_tales_8_51%	You know this is a woman who is questioning her whole identity at this precise moment. The human perceives this, too.
%if_tales_8_52%	The algorithm is quick and ruthless in its proposition. The card it displays is The World reversed. Accept harsh truths. No one makes a change in this world.
%if_tales_8_53%	The human secretly agrees, but approaches from a different angle: The World upright. Bring closure to this enterprise, but feel fulfilled.
%if_tales_8_54%	You are the only one who has any power over the final display.
%if_tales_8_57%	The World reversed. Surrender and accept that change is not possible.
%if_tales_8_58%	The World upright. Accept that change is not possible, but she should feel fulfilled.
%if_tales_8_61%	Case 0015999 has to be banned from the readings room. The algorithm does not feel. The human was insulted by her slurs.
%if_tales_8_62%	You don't know if Case 0015999 ever realized the contradiction of the situation. You will never know what happened in the end, anyway.
%if_tales_8_67%	Case 0015999 leaves the readings room quietly. The algorithm does not feel. The human is relieved.
%if_tales_8_68%	You will never know what happened in the end, anyway.
%if_tales_9_2%	"Forensic Report of a Revolution" by Ivan Papiol.
%if_tales_9_3%	In our country's recent history there was a fascist regime that wouldn't hesitate to murder anyone that dared to speak against its values and leaders.
%if_tales_9_4%	The militia would discard their bodies in mass graves and send their severed hands to their families, as a warning of the fate awaiting the resistance.
%if_tales_9_5%	The enigmatic chiromancer Muixó developed a forensic palmistry practice that would find out how those killed had died and where they had been tossed away.
%if_tales_9_6%	So that their families could hopefully find the bodies of their loved ones and give them a proper burial.
%if_tales_9_7%	But eventually the regime's militia came storming down on the chiromancer's home and sent them to prison, claiming conspiracy against the regime.
%if_tales_9_8%	Despite these claims, Muixó's respected expertise in the field of forensic palmistry was so renowned that the police offered them a generous deal:
%if_tales_9_9%	They would be granted freedom as long as they helped the police find the terrorists that were killing key politicians in mysterious circumstances.
%if_tales_9_10%	Muixó would be handed an ornate, shoe-sized red box containing the right hand of one of the murdered politicians, and write a report with helpful information.
%if_tales_9_11%	The first box contained a hand with a strong Earth energy that the chiromancer felt belonged to someone born with a deep contentment for following orders.
%if_tales_9_12%	Muixó had seen this hand on TV before, making the regime's salute. Its pitiful fortune line made them chuckle the first time they saw it, so it was unforgettable.
%if_tales_9_13%	The chiromancer wrote in their report:
%if_tales_9_16%	About the hand's life line.
%if_tales_9_17%	About the hand's sad fortune line, and how miserable it was.
%if_tales_9_21%	Muixó talked about the hand's entire life line, without skimping on any detail.
%if_tales_9_22%	They talked about every small line cutting it, each meaning an adversity faced and a change in the winds of fate of the deceased hand's owner.
%if_tales_9_23%	And so their report was sent to the regime.
%if_tales_9_24%	The next day, the chiromancer stuck their arm out of the prison cell in order to get the next ornate red box.
%if_tales_9_25%	And their hand fell on the floor with a heavy thud, being the only part of the chiromancer's body to ever be free again.
%if_tales_9_30%	The chiromancer pointed out the faded fortune line in the politician's hand.
%if_tales_9_31%	And concluded their report guessing that this murder had probably just been a lucky success for the terrorists, for this was a very unlucky person.
%if_tales_9_32%	And so their report was sent.
%if_tales_9_33%	The next day, the chiromancer stuck their arm out of the prison cell in order to get the next ornate red box.
%if_tales_9_34%	This second box contained a familiar hand with Water energies. It was the hand of a famous writer and speaker of the regime. Muixó had attended one of her speeches.
%if_tales_9_35%	At the time, they took notice of the fact that this person's ring finger (the finger of art-inclined individuals) was remarkably long, and found it ironic.
%if_tales_9_36%	Because the thing that made her speeches popular were her views on art being the rotting of civilization. It was a shame that she was clearly talented at it.
%if_tales_9_37%	The chiromancer wrote in their report:
%if_tales_9_39%	About the hand's ring finger: this was the hand of an artist.
%if_tales_9_40%	About the ring marks covering the hand's index finger.
%if_tales_9_44%	Muixó pointed out in the report that this person covered their index finger with rings, meaning that they were afraid to show their talent for leadership.
%if_tales_9_45%	Perhaps another politician, hungry for power, had conspired against her?
%if_tales_9_46%	And so their report was sent to the regime.
%if_tales_9_47%	The next day, the chiromancer stuck their arm out of the prison cell in order to get the next ornate red box.
%if_tales_9_48%	And their hand fell on the floor with a heavy thud, being the only part of the chiromancer's body to ever be free again.
%if_tales_9_53%	They did not wish to insinuate that this hand's owner had partaken in clandestine artistic activities, but...
%if_tales_9_54%	If it was up to them, that was the lead that they would follow. There was a chance this hand's owner had met with a dangerous terrorist during a secret artistic endeavor.
%if_tales_9_55%	And so their report was sent to the regime. Muixó bit their lip, trusting that clandestine art groups had already had time to flee after their imprisonment.
%if_tales_9_56%	The next day, the chiromancer stuck their arm out of the prison cell in order to get the next ornate red box.
%if_tales_9_57%	Seeing the third box's hand brought a smile to Muixó's face. It meant everything was going as planned, and in their final report:
%if_tales_9_60%	Muixó wrote the truth.
%if_tales_9_61%	Muixó left the report blank.
%if_tales_9_65%	Muixó had always known that they were destined to die helping to overthrow the regime after the dictator had been murdered, and the time had come.
%if_tales_9_66%	But in their final moments, the chiromancer got cold feet and used their ink pen to cut a longer life line into their own hand in a desperate and futile last effort.
%if_tales_9_67%	The prison caught on fire during the retaliations with Muixó inside. At least their allies wouldn't know how their last moments went, and they would die a martyr.
%if_tales_9_72%	When handing in their report, Muixó felt their insides burn with the determination of knowing that the dictator was dead.
%if_tales_9_73%	And they also knew that the prison guards were probably the last fascist cockroaches resisting the inevitable.
%if_tales_9_74%	So while handing over the final report, they grabbed their guard's hand, looked them in the eyes, and said:
%if_tales_9_75%	You see this cross nearing the end of your life line? That means that you and the few remaining of your kind are destined to die in the fires of revolution.
%if_tales_10_2%	"The Curtain" by Elena Cortés Alonso.
%if_tales_10_3%	A sudden rattling of the caravan wakes you up suddenly and you realize that you're almost there.
%if_tales_10_4%	You feel the urge to lean out of the window, but you stop yourself: you already know the village you're visiting next, you have been there dozens of times.
%if_tales_10_5%	You have spent decades touring with your theater company all over the country, obsessed with taking art to those corners the great ones never reach.
%if_tales_10_6%	But when you get to the village the air tastes different. The facades of the dusty little houses seem strange and disconcerting.
%if_tales_10_7%	Unlike on other occasions... No one comes to greet you.
%if_tales_10_8%	Something's off.
%if_tales_10_9%	Maybe the mayor knows something; you've known her for a long time and she has always treated you as if you were family.
%if_tales_10_10%	"What's the matter? It's freezing cold, isn't it?" the company's costume designer asks.
%if_tales_10_11%	You sense that your people are feeling uneasy, and you try to calm them down so that the worry doesn't overtake them completely.
%if_tales_10_12%	"I'm going to the town hall. I'm sure it's all right," you reply.
%if_tales_10_13%	On the way to the town hall, you come across figures absorbed by their work, who look at you in silence as you pass by.
%if_tales_10_14%	You recognize their faces from other occasions, but there is something different about them, something that makes them unfamiliar.
%if_tales_10_15%	Absolutely no one greets you back.
%if_tales_10_16%	And, worst of all and a rather sinister detail: no one smiles.
%if_tales_10_17%	When you arrive at the town hall you find the door to the mayor's office open. You decide to enter.
%if_tales_10_18%	She barely looks at you when she says, indifferently, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be out on the street with the rest of the artists?"
%if_tales_10_21%	Inform her politely that your team is ready to perform.
%if_tales_10_22%	What's her deal? You demand respect.
%if_tales_10_26%	The mayor looks at you coldly and calls the security personnel to throw you out.
%if_tales_10_27%	You take a deep breath and try to calm down: you can't disappoint your company and leave them without today's gig.
%if_tales_10_31%	You try to ignore her disdain and inform her that you have arrived and the show will be at 9 o'clock, as usual.
%if_tales_10_32%	She dismisses you with an expressionless face and in your stomach you start to feel the urge to make use of your gift.
%if_tales_10_33%	You hold back: years ago you swore to yourself that you would never use it again, that your merits would always be your own, not those of a supernatural force.
%if_tales_10_34%	And that's why you created the theater company, to show that you could make people feel good without artifice.
%if_tales_10_35%	You return to the place where you parked and everyone is waiting with suitcases full of costumes and set pieces.
%if_tales_10_36%	You can sense their concern and worry, but you want them to be focused for tonight.
%if_tales_10_37%	"Is everything okay? What's wrong?" your assistant director asks.
%if_tales_10_40%	Lie and put on a happy face.
%if_tales_10_41%	Tell the truth, but try not to worry them.
%if_tales_10_45%	"Yes, everything is great, the mayor can't wait to see what we’ve brought this season!", you say, producing a not very convincing smile.
%if_tales_10_46%	They've known you for too long and no one believes a word you say.
%if_tales_10_47%	They suggest that perhaps it would be better to leave, but you refuse.
%if_tales_10_51%	"It seems that the village is not at its best, but everything will be fine, don't worry," you acknowledge in a calming voice, trying to not upset them further.
%if_tales_10_52%	They are not entirely convinced by your words, but they trust you because you are family.
%if_tales_10_53%	Everyone goes off to prepare their roles and you can't help but remain pensive, repeating to yourself over and over again that something is not right.
%if_tales_10_54%	It would be so easy if you used your gift....
%if_tales_10_55%	No. You shouldn't. You go back to your caravan to review your notes before rehearsing the more complicated scenes with the team.
%if_tales_10_56%	Dusk falls, and it is time for the show to begin.
%if_tales_10_57%	People from the village begin to drop by and surround the stage, choosing where to sit.
%if_tales_10_58%	Again those worn-out features, those inexpressive looks, full of emptiness...
%if_tales_10_59%	What happened to them?
%if_tales_10_60%	Should you fear for yourself and your family?
%if_tales_10_61%	Perhaps it would be better to suspend the show and leave as soon as possible from this remote corner of the world that seems to be cursed.
%if_tales_10_62%	The attendees start to get impatient, and some people on your team can't hide their fear.
%if_tales_10_63%	It's showtime and you have to decide.
%if_tales_10_66%	Endure. The show must go on.
%if_tales_10_67%	Better not chance it. You should leave.
%if_tales_10_71%	Deep down inside you feel that there is something wrong and that the wisest thing to do is to leave and not put anyone in danger.
%if_tales_10_72%	You gather everything as quickly as you can and leave the place under the impassive gaze of the villagers.
%if_tales_10_73%	In your heart you feel that this has been a failure and that if you had not been so stubborn maybe you could have saved the situation.
%if_tales_10_74%	You don't sleep a wink all night, while you try to hide your sadness crouched in your caravan, rattling away from that place in a hurry.
%if_tales_10_75%	Probably forever.
%if_tales_10_80%	Something is not right, but together you've always been strong, and you are sure that the show will break through the hostile mood.
%if_tales_10_81%	The audience's irritated murmurs drop in volume as the spotlights come on and the curtain finally opens, kicking off the show.
%if_tales_10_82%	You listen to the actors interpreting the first lines of the script as you try to calm the accelerated pounding between the walls of your chest.
%if_tales_10_83%	You take a breath and repeat to yourself that art doesn't always have to be well received, there are times when it must be fought for, like everything else in life.
%if_tales_10_84%	But suddenly the music stops dead in its tracks and pulls you out of your thoughts.
%if_tales_10_85%	You peek through, hidden behind the thick curtain.
%if_tales_10_86%	You see that some villagers have approached the boards, and they look at the team from below in a disturbing way.
%if_tales_10_87%	At first you are paralyzed... but you manage to tell the supervisor to move on with the show, and so they do.
%if_tales_10_88%	However, the atmosphere becomes too tense when someone throws an object on stage and it hits one of the actresses, who turns pale with the impact.
%if_tales_10_91%	Ok, that’s it, you decide to pack up and leave.
%if_tales_10_92%	"Enough!" you command the audience.
%if_tales_10_100%	Your shout is heard throughout the village and the villagers remain silent when they see you appear on stage.
%if_tales_10_101%	You feel that everything is shaking inside you but you don't want it to show. It's time for you to keep calm.
%if_tales_10_102%	"Why are you reacting like this to people who just want to make your life a little nicer through theater?" you project your voice so everyone can hear you.
%if_tales_10_103%	Your question is not well received. The gray faces from the audience burst into uncontrolled screams. You feel like they want to annihilate you.
%if_tales_10_104%	The mood keeps getting more violent and everything starts to spin.
%if_tales_10_105%	It's too much pressure and in the blink of an eye you could fix it and come out of it all unscathed.
%if_tales_10_106%	Your company looks at you, mute, uncomprehending and fearing you may not leave this town.
%if_tales_10_109%	You promised yourself you wouldn't resort to this, but... You use your gift.
%if_tales_10_110%	Endure. Try to get the audience's attention once more.
%if_tales_10_114%	You close your eyes and all the noise fades away. You promised yourself you would never use it again, but this time you have no choice.
%if_tales_10_115%	Applause suddenly bursts into your ears and you notice the beaming smiles of the audience watching you.
%if_tales_10_116%	For a moment you forget about your company and greet it with delicacy, savoring what you have just earned.
%if_tales_10_117%	But that night, in your bed, something doesn't fit inside you.
%if_tales_10_118%	You think you did the right thing to protect your people, but... was it really?
%if_tales_10_119%	You hardly sleep a wink and when you do get to sleep you are invaded by nightmares.
%if_tales_10_120%	They will be with you for a long time.
%if_tales_10_125%	You gesture with your arms and demand that everyone be quiet so they can hear you.
%if_tales_10_126%	You stare at the audience and ask for the curtain to close and for your colleagues to hide behind it.
%if_tales_10_127%	They throw objects at you again, whistling very close to your head.
%if_tales_10_128%	"I don't know what has happened to you, but you have forgotten how to live!"
%if_tales_10_129%	You shout, furious, as you rejoin your company, who are waiting for you on the other side of the curtain.
%if_tales_10_130%	You urge them to leave but they are afraid to abandon the theater. They propose that you confront the people one more time.
%if_tales_10_131%	You have seen the emptiness in their gazes, you recognized that deep hole from which no one can recover.
%if_tales_10_132%	You know it's not going to work.
%if_tales_10_135%	It's time to get the hell out of here, now.
%if_tales_10_136%	There's no other way... you must use your gift.
%if_tales_10_140%	Your whole company keeps insisting that you can't just walk away after everything that has happened.
%if_tales_10_141%	You can't get them to see reason and you fear for everyone's lives at this point...
%if_tales_10_145%	You close your eyes and all the noise fades away. You promised yourself you would never use it again, but this time you have no choice.
%if_tales_10_146%	...
%if_tales_10_147%	Everyone sleeps peacefully in their vehicles as you drive away from that village you know you will never return to.
%if_tales_10_148%	Even though your people will never remember anything.
%if_tales_10_149%	The restlessness has disappeared from inside you, and you dive in search of an ounce of guilt, but you don't find it.
%if_tales_10_150%	You swore you weren't going to use your gift again, but this time it was to protect your company, your only family.
%if_tales_10_151%	You let the swaying of the caravan lull you to sleep and immediately fall into a deep slumber that reconciles you with what really nests inside you.
%dream_db_0%	You dream about being a fish with beautiful black and gold scales with fractal patterns. One day, roaming your favorite reef, you encounter an octopus whose camouflage shifts constantly, displaying images of outer space. He tells you that within your scales is written the secret to travel into and beyond a black hole.
%dream_db_1%	You find yourself at the age of five, collecting bones from small animals in the middle of a red forest, loaded with autumn leaves. A misstep makes you drop the bones into the river, and the water catches fire.
%dream_db_2%	Some men in crimson suits are following you around the city. You hide yourself in a diner and order a cherry coke. A beautiful old woman sits next to you and offers you her handkerchief. You smell it and you fall in love.
%dream_db_3%	Doing laundry, you fall off your balcony and land in a pool made of pizza. You have to eat your way out. You manage to exit the pool, but the pizza was so delicious you decide to jump back in for a second round.
%dream_db_4%	You are reading a book while watching your mother sew some cool patches on your sister's jacket. When she's done she shows you the jacket, and all the patches have eyes that blink, looking at you.
%dream_db_5%	You dream you are the owner of a tiki bar. You design a cocktail by mixing absinth and boiled mackerel spines. It's so good that a line of one hundred people forms outside your business. Anyone who drinks it feels the urge to write poetry.
%dream_db_6%	You craft a beautiful acoustic guitar with the wood of a millennium-old oak with blue leaves. You don't know how to play it, so you summon a musician spirit to live inside the instrument. You caress the strings and the subtle harmonic hum makes you cry.
%dream_db_7%	You are walking through the desert in the middle of the night. You can see the lines connecting constellations in the sky. You find a lonely camping tent with a dim light coming out of it. Inside there is a fairy with broken wings. You make love until sunrise. When you wake up there is no tent, and you are in the middle of an oasis with crystal waters.
%dream_db_8%	You are building a machine inside the Sun. You don't know what the machine is for, but you keep building it obsessively. When you're done, you pull a lever and the Sun vanishes along with every other star, leaving you in absolute darkness.
%dream_db_9%	You are reading a book with pages made of mirrors. You can still read the text surfacing all over your face in the reflection. It is a treatise that proves that the Big Bang theory is a lie. When you close the book, the universe stops existing.
%dream_db_10%	You are walking your pet lizard through a maze made of uneven rocks. From time to time, the lizard disappears beneath the rocks and comes out with surreal insects: a rainbow mantis with twelve eyes, an obsidian beetle with the face of a moai statue, a caterpillar with spiral markings running with quicksilver... At the end of the maze you find a cauldron and make soup with the bugs.
%dream_db_11%	You are performing a dance in front of a hundred jade statues. You dance and sweat for three full days. You fail the final step and the statues crumble and you are engulfed in black flames. You enjoy it.
%dream_db_12%	Your sister Patrice is sleeping on a hammock. She seems to be having a nightmare but you can't manage to wake her up. You decide to meditate and travel inside her dreams. Patrice was dreaming she was playing poker with a bunch of naked old men. They force you to join the game and now you're both trapped.
%dream_db_13%	You dream you live inside a giant bear that you can control with your thoughts. When you are hungry you ravage small towns and collect some of the meat and veggies you pour through the bear's throat. You don't feel any remorse at all and the food tastes delicious.
%dream_db_14%	You are flying a plane made of seashells and colorful feathers. You land inside a frozen volcano and pick some rocks to install into your ship that make it fly faster. Then you race against wind spirits and can't stop laughing.
%dream_db_15%	You are digging your own grave when your shovel hits something hard. You unearth a bronze statue of yourself. The statue comes to life and you agree to switch places. It buries you and your bronze self keeps on living your life.
%dream_db_16%	You meet with an architect to commission them to design a castle made of glass. The architect makes you pay for their design by letting them eat a piece of your liver. You cook it with a sauce of red wine, onion and rosemary. They let you taste a bit and it is delicious.
%dream_db_17%	You work at a gas station cleaning the windshields of the customers. You spot a little white dog inside of a van while you're working on it. You bark at the animal and the dog, scared, jumps out of a window and escapes. The customers blame it on you and you are fired.
%dream_db_18%	You are old and surrounded by eleven kids. They're all orphans from different planets that you decided to adopt. You are teaching them to play a very complex board game about witchcraft. All of them fall asleep mid explanation and you feel disappointed.
%dream_db_19%	You switch bodies with your sister and go to meet one of her lovers. The man takes you to have a fancy dinner of oysters and crawfish. You drink a bottle of white wine and make love on his boat. The following morning you discover you have switched bodies with the man and you are alone on the boat, lost in the middle of the ocean.
%dream_db_20%	You are wearing the most beautiful dress made out of black skulls and lilies. You attend an award ceremony that celebrates the best students of the occult. You are nominated in every category but don't win a single award. You meet a beautiful waitress and have sex backstage.
%dream_db_21%	You meet with your long-lost father at the highest room of a lighthouse. He is wearing a golden mask. He gives you a small ebony key and tells you to insert it into the keyhole on its mask. You do so and discover your father has no face, but a tiny waterfall that floods the entire room.
%dream_db_22%	You dream one of your eyes is blue, and the other is purple. You inspect them closer in a mirror and find out they have mathematical formulas inscribed around the iris. You write them down and your eyes return to normal. A blind man comes to your home and buys the formula from you for a fortune.

%db_inbox_intro_37%	Hello!
%db_inbox_letter_37%	I got to talk with one of your partners recently and they told me we could probably help each other?

Let me know when it's a good time for me to visit.

%db_inbox_signature_1_39%	Wunn
%db_inbox_intro_40%	Ponder this:
%db_inbox_letter_40%	I offer you the possibility to sabotage one of your rivals. But, should you reject my offer, I will go to your rivals and offer this very same deal to them. Do you trust your sisters to play as fair as you will?
%db_inbox_signature_1_40%	Let me know when you reach a decision,
%db_inbox_signature_2_40%	Wunn
%db_inbox_intro_41%	For the attention of the oracle witch,
%db_inbox_letter_41%	Hello, my name is Zira. Me and a group of my sisters are fleeing from a conflict in our former coven. We are being hunted and executed. We are desperate. I beg of you, hear me out.

%db_inbox_intro_42%	Dear Sister Fortuna,

%db_inbox_signature_1_42%	Looking forward to meeting you,

%db_inbox_intro_45%	Are you satisfied with your fate?
%db_inbox_letter_45%	Forgive my boldness, but... Do I sense some unease within you, Fortuna? How can a Writer of Fates be this disheartened?
%db_inbox_signature_1_45%	Why don't you... draw another card?
%db_inbox_intro_46%	How are you, Fortuna?
%db_inbox_letter_46%	It's been a while! Are the years treating you well? I'd love to come and visit. Just let me know a good time and I'll fly over!
%db_inbox_signature_1_46%	Jasmine

%db_sphere_desc_3%	Before magical enslavement was forbidden, the long-lost coven of the Jade Sculptors tasked seven major Daemons with carving a gigantic temple out of a moon.

%db_sphere_title_4%	Jvalana Payash-jyothi
